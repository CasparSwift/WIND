he just looks away from where the spray emits and barks again ! it also does n't work 100 of the time and we 're not sure why when we fill it it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to or it is n't working very long it does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker terriers are just too stubborn to care if they 're getting sprayed i guess
having read the other reviews of this product on this site i decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered i ordered three of these products from this site and when they arrived not a single one of them worked at all they were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested these products are completely useless although i have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects i would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website that if the product does not work it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged thus your credit card will still be billed your dogs will still be barking and you may get stuck with products that are worthless
i have purchased a total of three of these collar they seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate then after a few months they quit working altogether i check the charge and the batteries and that 's not the problem i do n't think they are for large outdoor dogs
this item did not work when i got it i returned it to zelco who informed me that it was my error they did not do refunds and returned it to me i had a previous model zelco that worked great for years it had a switch this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off gr
dear customer service i am please about the refund i am please about all thinks that i purchase from you the web page where i bought zelco itty bitty '' book light volume 2 i believe is not clear by looking the page i had the impression that i was going to buy a mini lamp where i was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a led lamp at list this was my impression sincerely adrian
i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor 's mutt the offending dog is often left on the neighbor 's porch where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by before ordering i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect in my case the neighbor 's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine unfortunately this was not too close for comfort '' as far as the dog was concerned having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working alas it did not some dogs just do n't hear them in my case it was probably due at least in part to the distance my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20 ' of the target if it does n't work go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund which is exactly what i did by the way you do n't need an ra aka rma number to return the device just send it to the company along with your receipt and a note saying that you would like a refund not an exchange i sympathize with anyone having this problem and wish you all the best of luck no one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason and the argument that dogs bark '' simply does not hold any water
this item is cheaply made and i sent it back the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left it plopped down to the left it could n't keep the right time
initially my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking but after a couple of days they acted like they did n't even hear the sound now they are back to bark all you want ''
i bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier he did n't even notice it was there i put it near his crate and it still did n't stop him from barking i pushed the manual button and still nothing it promises to stop annoying barking but it did n't stop my dog for one minute it was a complete waste of my money
i picked this up after reading the reviews one of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away the other just wandered around and took no notice neither seemed at all this product had zero affect on our dogs ' barking i 'm going to return it
our dogs did n't even notice it we have three small terriers and i thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers i was wrong the kept on
dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them the device i received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity some do n't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them i had a chance to try a different brand years ago and i know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison if you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten there you go suicide by dog that 's a good use for it may be it is just quality control you might get lucky if not then you might have to deal with a seller that wo n't return calls or like i did so you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones i hate being cheated score another point for the bad guys
it requires effort from owners bought this to help control our sheltie 's barking behavior when we first tried it he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from we noticed that this alone would n't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'no ' or 'quiet ' this meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids did n't help very much they have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands so now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at lots of to do here well the dog has n't stopped barking and obeying yet but we have n't been as good at working with him either my next purchase will probably be a citronella 'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order my oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor 's dogs from barking or at least got their attention my question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself not sure i would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on in case
i have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping it is very out of control and this device didnt help at all i know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar a friend has one and recommended it to me they are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me the dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them
i have ordered this unit twice this past month the first one did not work properly in one of the units the signal was distorted after returning it to the supplier i ordered it again from another amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all i will now look for another brand
the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface would be pushing it
if you want to waste your money on a useless product then buy shedender the people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair specifically undercoat however my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding the rub is that the undercoat does n't shed not that much anyway the top coat does so all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that is n't the root of your shedding problem in the first place and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside as i said this product does remove a lot of hair however after a full session with the shedender i went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as i usually do the next day i wired out just as much as i would have if i did n't use shedender the bottom line your pets shed from their top coat not the bottom coat so you 're wasting your time and money with this product
i have a hefty manx who is constantly shedding i saw the commercial for this product and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals and just had to have one boy was i ever disappointed ! when i try to brush my cat with it the teeth just float on top of her hair they do n't even go down into the undercoat maybe it 's because she 's chubby i do n't know but it sure does n't work for her i 'm left handed so i had to turn the blade the other way on the handle maybe i 'm not using it right i 'm still very disappointed the animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them
i got this for my cat ocicat breed he 's a cat that does n't generally need much grooming except when the season changes shedender worked just like the commericals one brush and fur goes flying everywhere it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back as u can see in the picture the tool is small if you have the patience and extra time and if your pet has the patience too ! u can think about saving some money with this tool if you want something more efficient invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead i bought both and compared them but i 'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price
the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove
this product does what it claims i recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well the downside of the product is the size it does a good job if you have an hour or more depending on the size of your pet to spend using it they tout it 's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more i wish i had invested in the bigger more expensive furminator i rate this product with two stars only because it 's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal it would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat
after reading several reviews i only read one that was negative i concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs well as soon as i opened the package i realized just how right the negative review was this book stand would hold up a children 's soft cover back any of my school books are not stably supported i would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages unless you have thinner hard back textbooks the hard back will support the pages this is not worth buying especially not for 20.00 make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is if that is with you need then this is the one for you
after reading the one review on this site i ordered the bookmate and eagerly awaited it as i was using a fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks when it arrived i was sorely disappointed the back support for the book measures only about 7 '' '' and the depth measurement for the book is 1 '' any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7 '' '' is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand is n't big enough in addition because the depth is only 1 '' forget any book with say over 500 pages at least the fellowes stand has a back support of 12 '' x 9 '' its deficiency is its page holding arms i ca n't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook as perhaps this amazon category is targeted could use this bookmate usefully
in principle this should be a great product we got one and set it up in a few seconds our dogs responded to it very well and stopped most of their barking in spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind then after less than 10 days of use it went dead the vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit that one worked great for 5 days then it went catatonic with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently on mode the vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund that 's 2 out of 2 units defective which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer instead of wasting your time maybe you should look for a different manufacturer
the item did n't work at all as a matter of fact my dog did n't even flinch when i tested it right next to her head no she 's not deaf either we yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine the item actually melted in the sun it still worked though i was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun oh well lesson learned i 'm not trying to sound bitter but do n't waste your money on this item i 'm gon na try the shock collar next maybe i 'll have better luck thanks anyways mik
read the description carefully it states the speaker range is 50 ' not the microphone my dog stood 10 ' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it would n't trigger matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand even then it did n't go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower i also could n't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise not just me but my husband too so it 's not a case of super human hearing on my part SMILE yes the timer option is very nice this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking but what good is the timer function if the microphone ca n't pick up the barking so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else
i was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep my eight year old son and i managed to get the unit put together after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place we carried it up to his room and put the and into place my excitement turned to bitter dissapointment however when i tried to fit my son 's games into the shelves desighned to hold cd 's or vcr tapes the and dvd cases are too big to fit into these slots i had just not realized that they would not work with this model the whole reason i ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room so this will not work for me i will probably try to return it and order the newer model
i bought one of these last year and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor 's yard this device completely failed to stop the neighbor 's barking dog i could detect no effect whatsoever save your money and try something else i wish i could tell you what works but we 're still looking
i was sleepless and willing to try anything i mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor 's back porch where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly despite all my hope i could n't detect any change in barking with this device deployed in fact i had to abandon that side of the house until i hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog
i have had my super bark free for 3 years never really worked the way i hoped but i spent so much on it i keep trying well now it does n't work ca n't turn it off and it does n't cycle when the dog barks i called lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period 1 year '' they would just replace it i told him i was willing to pay to have it repaired he said we are just the distributor and do n't support repairs of our product that is the key they do not support their product ''
super bark free did n't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor 's dog 's extremely irritating loud barking he merely ignored it though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet i 'm mad that i wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product if you decide to purchase super bark free be sure it 's returnable for a full refund if it does n't live up to its claims and in the meantime shop around for a more effective product
this unit works for a couple of months i do n't know if it 's the rain or heat neither is suppose to bother it but after a couple of months it simply quits sensing the barking it gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger in addition the label starts to shrivel a sign that it ca n't really handle the weather i 've sent 7 of these now smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them stay away from this dog
i bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price wrong this pots get scratches from anything that goes near them after a few months of gentle use they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful also the handles get really hot
i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy
the design for using the dc adapter with this little light is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries then after i cleaned it all up it worked for about a week the batteries installed then the leds started flickering the next day it was dead to see if it had to do with the battery leak i took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head but something on the little circuit board must have blown the other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book i found this a problem with soft cover books at least putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better i had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions i 've gone through many zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out this one is beyond my ability and i 'm done giving zelco my money they are a nice idea but have no durability if they were cheaper it might not be such a big deal but for their price i would like to see them be far more durable
purchased the item arrived defective replacement was also defective
the light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night it would have been better with three for four leds
within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect this is my third and final bread machine the first two were breadman ultimates i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average pretty much every morning the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems this time i took extremely good care of the pan letting it cool down no soaking because it 's clearly the weak link in the system within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed making the machine useless currently it does n't seem very easy or even possible to buy a replacement pan for the breadman at this point i was done with the breadman much as i did n't want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably would n't work the same in the new machine i did n't see an alternative and got one within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact i have been extremely careful with the pan i wait for it to cool and then remove the bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers i do n't let it soak at all this is clearly a manufacturing defect i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate 1 the top of the bread rarely gets brown i 've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much 2 i do n't understand what the crust control option does it does n't seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it does n't make much sense 3 the programmability is very weak on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs 4 the programmability options are very limited you ca n't control the knockdown time between risings you ca n't add risings to the default three they do give you a lot of time control on the risings you ca n't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle it 's all one cycle when you turn off the preheat cycle this only affects the programs and not the custom ones and worst of all you ca n't bake for more than 70 minutes this is utterly ridiculous i 'm sure this is a safety feature '' but it means you ca n't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising i 've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount type and quality of yeast if you follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast it should work okay this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs even using fleischmann 's instead of red star made a difference the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations at this point i 'm done with bread machines they are a failed technology in fact teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology all you have to do is search for teflon polytetrafluoroethylene and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees eg frying pans perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread i 've thought about this but there 's no way to make a bread machine without teflon going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon there is just no other viable solution i love making bread every day and i 'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology it 's back to the occasional loaf it 's the only rational and healthy solution
we could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients we also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker but could n't get it to work must be the rising temparature is not appropriate
there are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed this is one of them it 's made cheaply and even before it breaks it 's flimsiness does not inspire confidence the levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression as anyone who 'seriously ' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks many will be unchallenged right from the beginning the standard if the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue you need more resistance to crunches there 's a reason why crunches are done lying down the weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up much of what makes the ab crunch machine 'work ' is your weight dropping on it not your muscles working this little piece of plastic does n't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides you may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect but you can get this effect or without any equipment at all ! just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or of course by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly a hassle lying down to do crunches is we 've reached the real problem this thing is designed to avoid effort it seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort unfortunately exercise is effort and the more you avoid effort the less exercise you get
it 's a great concept although resistance is almost useless i 'm in my and although reasonably fit have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them here was a solution which claimed to get around this when i first got the unit i gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable i opened the front replaced the yellow bands with the heavy duty '' orange ones and tried again again almost nothing at 6 seconds a rep 10 minutes gets you 100 do n't know about you but although i could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense i would certainly know about it the next day i tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing this makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they feel the burn '' very hard to believe with that said this is n't necessarily the fault of as seen on tv '' that they sell this product what 's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although i ca n't imagine who they did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10 restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a shipping cost it hardly makes it worth the effort am going to find another use for it perhaps a coat hanger positive voters must be getting from somewhere perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it do n't believe me buy one and find out for yourself
i have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for 20 not on sale either regular price same siz
the corningware dish is great my 1 star is not for the item it is for dynadirect they are horrible ! item was backordered but they never told me and charged my credit card when i called they finally told me it was backordered and i ask that they cancel the order and refund my money bad bad servic
i was really hopeful about this product working i have four dogs ages 2 through 8. i tried and tried to teach them how to use this product but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button they just ignored the paw and would n't ever put their paw on it to even touch it
this is very misleading this item is only half of the package after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work very disappointed in amazon for allowing this
i thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out i was so excited to get it and the chime did n't work oh well
in december 2002 i purchased the pet chime and paw two additional paws i was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks in the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by lentek they 're great if they work
as this is a consumable food product i 'd like to know what each color is made of
junk junk junk thank heavens amazon has such wonderful customer service myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor we felt we researched it well but the second use shredding cheese it fused together forever this seems to be a constant problem which kitchen aid will not admit they refused to take it back ! look at customer reviews on the kitchenaid website we purchased cuisinart works great
sent flowers to my father 's girlfriend in florida for her birthday flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot florida sun my father tried to contact them and nobody responded i sent an that i am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund i learned a lesson stick to a name brand florist
my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box the roses were dead and black she thought i was mad at her do not buy i repeat do not buy
i am very disappointed these flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store i ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked i buy roses alot and i know what a fair cost is for good quality if you 're paying less than 30 beware
i checked the proflowers site and it said i still had 3 days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before christmas it 's now the day after christmas and they still have n't gotten them
this is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system there are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money senseo melitta and others some other systems such as the nespresso are just as pricey but make significantly better coffee that leaves us with this system way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces unless you 're absolutely enthralled with the taste of flavia coffee or one of their other beverages there are better cheaper less wasteful alternatives
what was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn it looked as if it had been dropped from a plane ! the entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape i would really like to own this bookcase but i want it delivered in usable condition
listen i have bought several of these book lights every time they break it is not the bulb or the plug or the batteries it is the wiring do n't bother i am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes any suggestions
i 've gone through so many of these that i have lost count for someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour the light lasts no more than two months i do n't mean the batteries i only use the light plugged into an outlet but it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average very flimsy design i guess yet i have continued to buy it because there 's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read no wonder they do n't offer any warranties ! but now it looks like there are some other options and i have vowed never to buy this light again
being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons firstly there is no auto so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly secondly when using batteries they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries this light is also extremely fragile over a couple of years i went through 7 of these ! i would not recommend this light for the amount you spend on the purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply and the constant new purchases after it breaks you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises available at barnes nobel come on and get it in stock amazon ! it is terrific ! it has a clock with an alarm and a timer you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes at that time you can extend the minutes if you do n't do so for example you 're sleeping it will automatically shut off it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light
why does this light cost 30 for this price and supposedly a bunch of design awards '' i find this light to be of extremely poor quality the connection between the chord and the adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension the chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on i am still looking for a better alternative but for the price this light is n't worth the investment
i bought this for my at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free '' gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee
the worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address that person now gets a slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it they also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this party company bad business and aggravating
the can has to be 100 dent free for this to work if you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can this thing wo n't open your product a great idea but this needed a little more refinement paper weight in my min
this is the worse can opener i have ever bought it has failed four out of 6 times i have used it ! ! when it fails '' it stops walking around the can '' and you have to locate a little screw and get a phillips head screw driver and turn that till the opener releases your can ! needless to say i am stuck with a useless can opener and am out 20
be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges on the lid and on the can itself otherwise it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space
i was expecting a device that cut the of the lid but this one cuts the can just below the lid the resulting edge while not razor sharp is hazardous in point of fact the instructions warn note the cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care '' contradicting the prominent no sharp edges '' claim on the packaging on a typical can the opener struggles to complete its task coming to a near stop at times of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life it has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical 303 can about times for large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around when the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can there is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point but if the reverse button does n't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can this manual release operation is challenging and generally messy to perform the cutter a sharp edged wheel is not removable for cleaning so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth after removing the batteries i recommend passing up this gadget
the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't ! this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt what a useless thing i 'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor this thing certainly does n't do it ! if you 're looking to buy this thing look again there must be something better if not just your regular broom
the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know that i would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop when using the wet will leave water lines where i stop therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels when using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks ! i have not recommended this product to anyone a waste of 100.00
not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs but the company also refused to provide a after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing after sitting out in a rainstorm the super bark stop shorted out and is now totally worthless find another product you 'll thank me later
the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter but traveling i would use the batteries do n't make this mistake
i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy
bought a global knife a few years ago then bought the ceramic sharpening device can not keep this knife sharp it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels i use the cheap sabatiers 9 for the set and the block anway it 's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor
the design for using the dc adapter with this little light is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries then after i cleaned it all up it worked for about a week the batteries installed then the leds started flickering the next day it was dead to see if it had to do with the battery leak i took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head but something on the little circuit board must have blown the other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book i found this a problem with soft cover books at least putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better i had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions i 've gone through many zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out this one is beyond my ability and i 'm done giving zelco my money they are a nice idea but have no durability if they were cheaper it might not be such a big deal but for their price i would like to see them be far more durable
purchased the item arrived defective replacement was also defective
not a good light the light is already fading and i do n't use it very often very disappointed
the light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night it would have been better with three for four leds
we could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients we also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker but could n't get it to work must be the rising temparature is not appropriate
there are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed this is one of them it 's made cheaply and even before it breaks it 's flimsiness does not inspire confidence the levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression as anyone who 'seriously ' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks many will be unchallenged right from the beginning the standard if the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue you need more resistance to crunches there 's a reason why crunches are done lying down the weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up much of what makes the ab crunch machine 'work ' is your weight dropping on it not your muscles working this little piece of plastic does n't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides you may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect but you can get this effect or without any equipment at all ! just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or of course by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly a hassle lying down to do crunches is we 've reached the real problem this thing is designed to avoid effort it seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort unfortunately exercise is effort and the more you avoid effort the less exercise you get
it 's a great concept although resistance is almost useless i 'm in my and although reasonably fit have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them here was a solution which claimed to get around this when i first got the unit i gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable i opened the front replaced the yellow bands with the heavy duty '' orange ones and tried again again almost nothing at 6 seconds a rep 10 minutes gets you 100 do n't know about you but although i could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense i would certainly know about it the next day i tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing this makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they feel the burn '' very hard to believe with that said this is n't necessarily the fault of as seen on tv '' that they sell this product what 's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although i ca n't imagine who they did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10 restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a shipping cost it hardly makes it worth the effort am going to find another use for it perhaps a coat hanger positive voters must be getting from somewhere perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it do n't believe me buy one and find out for yourself
i bought one of these last year and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor 's yard this device completely failed to stop the neighbor 's barking dog i could detect no effect whatsoever save your money and try something else i wish i could tell you what works but we 're still looking
i was sleepless and willing to try anything i mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor 's back porch where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly despite all my hope i could n't detect any change in barking with this device deployed in fact i had to abandon that side of the house until i hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog
he just looks away from where the spray emits and barks again ! it also does n't work 100 of the time and we 're not sure why when we fill it it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to or it is n't working very long it does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker terriers are just too stubborn to care if they 're getting sprayed i guess
having read the other reviews of this product on this site i decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered i ordered three of these products from this site and when they arrived not a single one of them worked at all they were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested these products are completely useless although i have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects i would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website that if the product does not work it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged thus your credit card will still be billed your dogs will still be barking and you may get stuck with products that are worthless
i 've been through four of these expensive units they work great on my great pyrenees dog at least they work for awhile then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with and then i send it back for repair once i got back a unit that worked again for awhile then i got back a unit that never worked stopped sending in my broken units after that so in desperation and impending poverty i switched to a shock collar it was either that or what my breeder calls a blue juice special '' it also worked and yes i tried it on myself and decided that it was n't cruel at all but the punchline is this the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar at least they were cheaper so i did n't lose as much money
sometimes it sprays when she barks most of the time it does n't so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it 's not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine my children found this amusing
i have purchased a total of three of these collar they seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate then after a few months they quit working altogether i check the charge and the batteries and that 's not the problem i do n't think they are for large outdoor dogs
i have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for 20 not on sale either regular price same siz
the corningware dish is great my 1 star is not for the item it is for dynadirect they are horrible ! item was backordered but they never told me and charged my credit card when i called they finally told me it was backordered and i ask that they cancel the order and refund my money bad bad servic
after reading several reviews i only read one that was negative i concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs well as soon as i opened the package i realized just how right the negative review was this book stand would hold up a children 's soft cover back any of my school books are not stably supported i would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages unless you have thinner hard back textbooks the hard back will support the pages this is not worth buying especially not for 20.00 make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is if that is with you need then this is the one for you
after reading the one review on this site i ordered the bookmate and eagerly awaited it as i was using a fellowes plastic bookstand for my softcover textbooks when it arrived i was sorely disappointed the back support for the book measures only about 7 '' '' and the depth measurement for the book is 1 '' any substantial softcover textbook whose frame is larger than 7 '' '' is going to have its pages flop over backward because the stand is n't big enough in addition because the depth is only 1 '' forget any book with say over 500 pages at least the fellowes stand has a back support of 12 '' x 9 '' its deficiency is its page holding arms i ca n't see how anyone using a an average sized cookbook as perhaps this amazon category is targeted could use this bookmate usefully
in principle this should be a great product we got one and set it up in a few seconds our dogs responded to it very well and stopped most of their barking in spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind then after less than 10 days of use it went dead the vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit that one worked great for 5 days then it went catatonic with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently on mode the vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund that 's 2 out of 2 units defective which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer instead of wasting your time maybe you should look for a different manufacturer
it appears that the viatek product bark stop pro is related to the lentek design asin they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer i have used tried the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek who noted that the unit only works on the audible '' setting dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ultrasonic '' setting furthermore it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds banging doors wind noise etc this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction quality i 've tried two different units and they both do not work the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks
i was really hopeful about this product working i have four dogs ages 2 through 8. i tried and tried to teach them how to use this product but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button they just ignored the paw and would n't ever put their paw on it to even touch it
this is very misleading this item is only half of the package after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work very disappointed in amazon for allowing this
i thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out i was so excited to get it and the chime did n't work oh well
in december 2002 i purchased the pet chime and paw two additional paws i was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks in the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by lentek they 're great if they work
dear customer service i am please about the refund i am please about all thinks that i purchase from you the web page where i bought zelco itty bitty '' book light volume 2 i believe is not clear by looking the page i had the impression that i was going to buy a mini lamp where i was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a led lamp at list this was my impression sincerely adrian
clock is smaller than i thought and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall made of cheap materials definitely not worth 25
as this is a consumable food product i 'd like to know what each color is made of
i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they do n't work well the manual is not thorough but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a delay unless you buy an ac adapter i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and was n't about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it it cut off my mom 's voice and i rarely heard her message the units also have annoying beeps that ca n't be turned off no real volume control either a very overpriced and poorly designed unit also the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them the sound is clear if it does n't cut you off but the units are far from
junk junk junk thank heavens amazon has such wonderful customer service myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor we felt we researched it well but the second use shredding cheese it fused together forever this seems to be a constant problem which kitchen aid will not admit they refused to take it back ! look at customer reviews on the kitchenaid website we purchased cuisinart works great
sent flowers to my father 's girlfriend in florida for her birthday flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot florida sun my father tried to contact them and nobody responded i sent an that i am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund i learned a lesson stick to a name brand florist
my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box the roses were dead and black she thought i was mad at her do not buy i repeat do not buy
i am very disappointed these flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store i ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked i buy roses alot and i know what a fair cost is for good quality if you 're paying less than 30 beware
i checked the proflowers site and it said i still had 3 days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before christmas it 's now the day after christmas and they still have n't gotten them
the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day since the police wo n't do anything about it i bought this bark free hahaha what a joke the darn dog barked more anyway it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money
i have had my super bark free for 3 years never really worked the way i hoped but i spent so much on it i keep trying well now it does n't work ca n't turn it off and it does n't cycle when the dog barks i called lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period 1 year '' they would just replace it i told him i was willing to pay to have it repaired he said we are just the distributor and do n't support repairs of our product that is the key they do not support their product ''
super bark free did n't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor 's dog 's extremely irritating loud barking he merely ignored it though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet i 'm mad that i wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product if you decide to purchase super bark free be sure it 's returnable for a full refund if it does n't live up to its claims and in the meantime shop around for a more effective product
this unit works for a couple of months i do n't know if it 's the rain or heat neither is suppose to bother it but after a couple of months it simply quits sensing the barking it gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger in addition the label starts to shrivel a sign that it ca n't really handle the weather i 've sent 7 of these now smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them stay away from this dog
initially my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking but after a couple of days they acted like they did n't even hear the sound now they are back to bark all you want ''
i bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier he did n't even notice it was there i put it near his crate and it still did n't stop him from barking i pushed the manual button and still nothing it promises to stop annoying barking but it did n't stop my dog for one minute it was a complete waste of my money
i picked this up after reading the reviews one of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away the other just wandered around and took no notice neither seemed at all this product had zero affect on our dogs ' barking i 'm going to return it
my beagle 13 mo cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks not smaller barking or any form of whining even if extremely loud
our dogs did n't even notice it we have three small terriers and i thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers i was wrong the kept on
dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them the device i received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity some do n't react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them i had a chance to try a different brand years ago and i know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison if you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten there you go suicide by dog that 's a good use for it may be it is just quality control you might get lucky if not then you might have to deal with a seller that wo n't return calls or like i did so you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones i hate being cheated score another point for the bad guys
it requires effort from owners bought this to help control our sheltie 's barking behavior when we first tried it he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from we noticed that this alone would n't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'no ' or 'quiet ' this meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids did n't help very much they have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands so now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at lots of to do here well the dog has n't stopped barking and obeying yet but we have n't been as good at working with him either my next purchase will probably be a citronella 'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order my oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor 's dogs from barking or at least got their attention my question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself not sure i would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on in case
i have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping it is very out of control and this device didnt help at all i know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar a friend has one and recommended it to me they are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me the dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them
this is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system there are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money senseo melitta and others some other systems such as the nespresso are just as pricey but make significantly better coffee that leaves us with this system way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces unless you 're absolutely enthralled with the taste of flavia coffee or one of their other beverages there are better cheaper less wasteful alternatives
if you want to waste your money on a useless product then buy shedender the people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair specifically undercoat however my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding the rub is that the undercoat does n't shed not that much anyway the top coat does so all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that is n't the root of your shedding problem in the first place and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside as i said this product does remove a lot of hair however after a full session with the shedender i went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as i usually do the next day i wired out just as much as i would have if i did n't use shedender the bottom line your pets shed from their top coat not the bottom coat so you 're wasting your time and money with this product
i have a hefty manx who is constantly shedding i saw the commercial for this product and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals and just had to have one boy was i ever disappointed ! when i try to brush my cat with it the teeth just float on top of her hair they do n't even go down into the undercoat maybe it 's because she 's chubby i do n't know but it sure does n't work for her i 'm left handed so i had to turn the blade the other way on the handle maybe i 'm not using it right i 'm still very disappointed the animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them
i got this for my cat ocicat breed he 's a cat that does n't generally need much grooming except when the season changes shedender worked just like the commericals one brush and fur goes flying everywhere it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back as u can see in the picture the tool is small if you have the patience and extra time and if your pet has the patience too ! u can think about saving some money with this tool if you want something more efficient invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead i bought both and compared them but i 'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price
this product does what it claims i recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well the downside of the product is the size it does a good job if you have an hour or more depending on the size of your pet to spend using it they tout it 's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more i wish i had invested in the bigger more expensive furminator i rate this product with two stars only because it 's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal it would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat
what was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn it looked as if it had been dropped from a plane ! the entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape i would really like to own this bookcase but i want it delivered in usable condition
listen i have bought several of these book lights every time they break it is not the bulb or the plug or the batteries it is the wiring do n't bother i am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes any suggestions
i 've gone through so many of these that i have lost count for someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour the light lasts no more than two months i do n't mean the batteries i only use the light plugged into an outlet but it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average very flimsy design i guess yet i have continued to buy it because there 's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read no wonder they do n't offer any warranties ! but now it looks like there are some other options and i have vowed never to buy this light again
why does this light cost 30 for this price and supposedly a bunch of design awards '' i find this light to be of extremely poor quality the connection between the chord and the adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension the chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on i am still looking for a better alternative but for the price this light is n't worth the investment
the item did n't work at all as a matter of fact my dog did n't even flinch when i tested it right next to her head no she 's not deaf either we yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine the item actually melted in the sun it still worked though i was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun oh well lesson learned i 'm not trying to sound bitter but do n't waste your money on this item i 'm gon na try the shock collar next maybe i 'll have better luck thanks anyways mik
the worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address that person now gets a slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it they also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this party company bad business and aggravating
the can has to be 100 dent free for this to work if you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can this thing wo n't open your product a great idea but this needed a little more refinement paper weight in my min
this is the worse can opener i have ever bought it has failed four out of 6 times i have used it ! ! when it fails '' it stops walking around the can '' and you have to locate a little screw and get a phillips head screw driver and turn that till the opener releases your can ! needless to say i am stuck with a useless can opener and am out 20
be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges on the lid and on the can itself otherwise it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space
i was expecting a device that cut the of the lid but this one cuts the can just below the lid the resulting edge while not razor sharp is hazardous in point of fact the instructions warn note the cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care '' contradicting the prominent no sharp edges '' claim on the packaging on a typical can the opener struggles to complete its task coming to a near stop at times of course this near stalling takes its toll on the battery life it has a fixed run cycle that will run around a typical 303 can about times for large cans you just push the button to restart it for more than one cycle until it makes it all the way around when the batteries give out and it comes to a stop in the middle of opening a can there is a tiny reverse button on the underside that is used to reverse its motion until you get back to the starting poin where it will release he can there is usually enough power left in drained batteries to backup to the release point but if the reverse button does n't work because the batteries are completely dead or the opener is jammed you must use a screwdrive to turn a release screw on the bottom until the opener backs up far enough to release the can this manual release operation is challenging and generally messy to perform the cutter a sharp edged wheel is not removable for cleaning so you are left to dabbing at it with a sponge or cloth after removing the batteries i recommend passing up this gadget
i bought this electric kettle and while it did heat water very quickly once i opened the lid the whole pot of water reeked of plastic needless to say the water was not drinkable i do n't know if i was stuck with a bad unit but i would not recommend this electric kettle buyer beware
i purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old 's room he has a 19 inch combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a 20 inch '' tv if you have a modern tv with speakers on the side it will not fit ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the item directly from and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item ! ! ! !
man this item is fantastic i love wasting 80 on pointless furniture getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems man i must be in heaven not only that but it breaks easily does this thing have no limit so i bought this great video center around a year ago and what happens it breaks i had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap it looks like you 're in a baby kids room similar to those play centers in day cares or mcdonalds man that is lame i just love having children decor in my house and it has to be 80 if i were you i would just let my systems tv and cds sit in some tubberware believe me it would be safer !
i was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep my eight year old son and i managed to get the unit put together after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place we carried it up to his room and put the and into place my excitement turned to bitter dissapointment however when i tried to fit my son 's games into the shelves desighned to hold cd 's or vcr tapes the and dvd cases are too big to fit into these slots i had just not realized that they would not work with this model the whole reason i ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room so this will not work for me i will probably try to return it and order the newer model
i bought this toaster to replace my cheap 10 toastmaster which held up for more than 10 years it was still working when i tossed it in favor of this toaster the sliding shelf that holds the bread in place is made of a very thin soft and flimsy steel after only 2 years of use the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism and it could not be fixed the shelf is hooked onto the slider by 2 small prongs that ultimately broke off i am surprised that kitchenaid would sell a piece of junk like this
this is not a 3 qt tea kettle it clearly says on the box 2 quarts i returned it
do not believe this line ergonomically designed nut cracker is ideal for cracking all sizes of nuts '' this nutcracker does not work with smaller nuts such as unopened pistachios or for those who love japanese foods the shells of of large ume plum seeds which are about the same size as a pistachio from the description the design seemed like it should have worked there were two problems 1 the cone is still too wide to trap and wedge smaller nuts even at the bottom and 2 range of the lever does not reach the smaller nuts when inside the cone because the nuts do n't wedge themselves squeezing the handle simply moves smaller nuts inside the cone because the lever does n't reach the smaller nuts the nuts ultimately reorient themselves until they are safe from harm 's way '' while i could see how this item might work for a larger nut like a large walnut it 's not why we purchased the unit in fairness i would n't have been so harsh in my review here if the manufacturer 's description set the proper expectation of nut sizes or types that this unit would work for
i bought this vacuum at a local costco after reading the reviews online it was great for a week until the belt broke after a dodgy incident with a throw rug that i 'd rather not go into i returned it and got another one and this one did an amazing job for one and half months almost two months later the suction is poor it spits back out dirt and generally seems malevolent we have two cats one dog one toddler and one pregnant wife in this house and quite frankly i need more peace of mind in my household products
this worked great for about two weeks of minimal use i live in new york and i do n't believe i got more than 5 gallons of water before the filter stopped working completely definately not worth the money
i purchased a brita after being a devout pitcher system user for years i 'd had a faucet system from pur a few years back and it leaked i was hesitant to go the faucet route again i figured i 'd pay extra for this most expensive brita model assuming mechanical integrity here 's my overview the installation to the sink was easy the unit has not leaked at all this is great the filter installation is easy the battery installation was also easy i have owned the system for 4 months and replaced 2 filters the aquaview display in bjs shows a clearly worn filter needing replacement this worn filter is shown through the aquaview window my own filters look as clean as the day i installed them at the point when the unit indicates yellow and red led lights this by brita 's own definition is when you replace your filter the cost of these filters is 25 a whack i would not mind this price if i felt the filter 's proverbial time was up i 'm feeling that i 'm replacing good filters i taste test the water each day the tap water defintely tastes worse than the brita water noticeable this gives me confidence the unit is working the aquaview feature is supposed to be away to say hey look my filter is really dirty it 's capturing the contaminants i 'd drink my town 's water is dirty if you leave sheets wet in the washer you will get a brown tinge why are my filters clean in the brita unit after two months the led says change the filter red light the aquaview shows me a clean filter to the naked eye the price of use for these filters is 150 per year with this red light going off every two months like a clock alarm brita is there a chance that the filter is still good even with your led light on can you let consumers in on this i realize many contaminants may not make your filter elements dirty but then why make something called an aquaview filter if the view shows a clean filter and i 'm throwing away a clean filter so fellow consumers beware ! the proof is not in the pudding taste alone does not insure that harmful contaminants are not reaching me means the system may not be working even on week one the led light system at least in my household does not correlate even slightly with the naked eye aquaview condition my filters look like they could go another month or two without dirtying this may be testimony to a really good filter the taste test does not correlate with the red light the water even with a replace indicator and a clean view indicator still tastes better than tap and equivalent to the filter being a day or two old i would say my filter is still good and brita has me over replacing good filters but we 're dealing with the world of microbial contaminants are they to go liberal on filter conservation on the other hand it 's a big hit to consumers and environment to be throwing these units away good so on this machine you will probably even with a dirty view find yourself replacing filters sooner than the manufacturer describes you may find yourself like me and another reviewer on this site with led lights going off and filters not looking dirty i am curious about the new jersey person who claims they have not changed it yet seemed like about 6 months this is disconcerting because the led light is a timer or volume control and would go off regardless of your aquaview filters visual condition 6 months on a filter seems too long though and i 'd conjecture you 're getting some bad stuff in your tap brita please provide much greater detail on your website which does n't work tonight for registration or support email regards
no way do you get up to 4 months usage as advertised on tv customer support says up to 100 gallons of water i doubt that from my experience averaged 2 weeks per costly filter the led green yellow red really serves no meaning function as it does not seem to actually give the you the status of the filter 's condition would not purchase one again look elsewhere for a different product and consider an under the counter system
attachment to the kitchen faucet is very suspect plastic parts do not make for a sure fit if you ever run hot water through the filter forget it this has happened twice at my house if hot water goes through the filter even for five seconds the filter is ruined two brand new filters at met this fate when this happens the whole contraption pops off the faucet spend another 70 bucks and install an industrial grade in line filter underneath the sink in line filter replacements are cheaper than small brita filters and can be found at ace hardware i am extremely disapointed in the brita aquaview product
this stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream built with quality materials like real metal not silvery plastic and sporting a sophisticated gorgeous retro appeal it looks equally as impressive in the hippest new york loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of however as is the case when function follows form this is a horrible blender do n't get me wrong i 'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant but quite frankly this blender is beyond bad most unfortunate is the blender 's propensity to splash everywhere even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand it seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor i suspect that the unit 's motor may be a contributing factor it only supports two speeds off and while i admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right the consequences of omitting speeds are overbearing consistently messy predictably inconvenient and potentially dangerous as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing the irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward and the blender 's lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion in fact this blender splashes so profusely that it 's nearly unusable it 's too bad because superficially this blender really is quite the objet d'art but when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance it has a long way to go even in comparison to a 29 oster if i had to summarize this blender as accurately succinctly and fairly as possible i 'd distill it down to one word regrettable ''
i found this set of flatware to be to light weight for my taste would be ok for a beach cabin or camping set
i have 2 of these things bought from the container store they suck like the other reviewer both of them are sticking in a down position after only a few months of use i got fed up with pushing the pump down and then pulling it up and ended up tearing the thing apart to see if i could fix it turns out there are filtering screens inside the pump which get blocked by just using it it looked like a coating of slime on the inside which is something you might expect to happen in a product that stays wet and has a filtering screen there is no way to clean the filters because the slime gets trapped inbetween the two filters
i bought this ottoman and i was very disappointed with the quality of this product one caster was already broken when it is arrived the casters did not match the correspondent wholes in the ottoman these wholes were framed by plastic so this plastic did not work at all so to make it work somehow i bought new casters also it is not beautiful ottoman everything made inaccurate the leather on the lid consist from different pieces without any order i tried to use the ottoman as a foot rest i 'm using it during just few days but already at the lid i can see the permanent place from my legs so my advice do n't buy this product it is a waste of money
this is the strangest foot stool i have ever seen it looks like something out of alice in wonderland my toy poodle loves it the stool is very small and looks very odd in a large room it does not match any of my chairs in terms of size my toy poodle fits perfectly inside the compartment it may fit a few small magazines but nothing more it is in the shape of a hat box not at all what i expected
i purchased a 4 towels 4 washcloths and 2 handtowels as a gift for my brother after the towels etc were washed several times they still left lint on him and the wall the towel rack was on needless to say he gave me my gift back now i 'm stuck with the towels if i could return them i would this item should not receive even 1 star but since 1 is the lowest that will have to do
very poor quality ! the material is very thin and even after multiple washing the fabric continues to bleed '' every time it 's used
i loved this grinder when we first got it because we use a french press an automatic coffee pot and an espresso maker the array of grinds is wonderful ! if it only lasted i had the same problem as everyone else the ring broke i found myself shoving paper in just to get a seal would be a superior product if they made it to last
i purchased this grinder and was very pleased with its performance i really like its compact size the ability to choose grind and to just press the button so i could fill my coffee maker with water while it ground i also like that the cord winds into itself and it stores easily however after about six months of daily use the plastic which holds the metal cup and blades to the body broke rendering the grinder useless i was very disappointed i do n't know if it 's a design flaw or just a fluke with mine but i probably wo n't purchase it again
i have this dispenser in an area where it only gets used once a day it takes 3 activations even at the max setting to get enough soap to wash your hands if you let it sit without using it for a couple days it takes activations before any soap at all comes out performance degrades further as amount of soap in dispenser decreases soap in it is dial antibacterial a mechanical dispenser would work better than this
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
the duallit sandwich cage barely holds one piece of bread let alone two for a sandwich it rips the bread and makes a mess of the toasters slot i through away twenty bucks on this apparatus
if you like the styling buy it ! hey it comes in colors ! but if you want performance and reliability avoid any francis unit they are made poorly and of light materials dave professional espresso repairman
we bought this beautiful machine after many other cheaper ones '' but within 6 months the wand started leaking have to leave a towel to soak up the excess water when not steaming the temp gauge never read the correct temp so i emailed cs and was informed that the gauge is for asthetic use only not accurate it 's for novelty use only a few weeks later the temp gauge stopped working completely 2 years later the seams are rusting when you release the steam valve now there is no steam pushed out no pressure to heat the milk we clean and maintain it a month do make alot of espresso day cs says to mail it to them to repair for a cost i am really disappointed it did n't last even 2 years
i 'm italian born and raised there and i grew up on cappuccinos this is in absolute the most gorgeous way to make a terrible cappuccino i have constant better result with the cheapest model made by krupps pros beautiful to look at espresso is good cons it takes ' minutes not second ! and this is according to the manufacturer to warm the machine up the cappuccino is always watery you need a stop watch to time exactly how much water you want in your espresso you get distracted and suddenly your espresso looks like any 'american ' style coffe
i purchased this item in december 2005 but did n't use it until july 2006. the wires broke on my first use i thought about requesting a replacement from kitchenaid but have decided instead to ask for a refund this item is a total waste of time and money
purchased this item from amazon took out of package and before even using it but touched to feel the tension on the wires and the wires broke got a replacement from kitchenaid very good service used it once for eggs went to wipe with a damp cloth and the wire broke again would not recommend purchasing this item
the deni 6000 works good for only a few weeks before it fails dangerously i have 2 units that did the exact same thing one of the rotating blades breaks off and comes out with the ice fortunately for me i noticed it in my glass before eating it two failures this machine is a potential safety hazzard i will be contacting deni about their defective design if you use this ice crusher and it starts sounding louder than usual one of your blades is probably bent and about to break off beware
i use crushed ice when i have medical problems i have'nt had any since i purchased the unit therefore i have nothing to report
i purchased the deni 6000 without reading the reviews what a dummy ! it is too noisy you have to hold it down or it will vibrate off the counter it gives you shaved ice not chunks or lumps i guess i purchased it because it was the right price i now own the waring professional ice crusher
initially purchased this item due to the easy cleaning feature however have been very disappointed with the performance since i purchased it only 3 months ago edges of the lids are extrememly jagged and scraps of metal label often land in the food ! and now after 3 months the motor is worn out and the unit buzzes whenever i attempt to use it the cutting tool wo n't even pierce the can without some forcefull manipulations bottom line do n't waste your money
i was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight it looked to be walmart type quality i would have been better off buying from linens and things
i was misled by the picture of 13 bars a complete set i got 5 bars which does me no good i want to change them all i am sending back and getting a complete set for 50
i ordered this unit for my mother she received only the bottome portion of it in one box and in the box was only a pen and not the rest of the filter the seller then accused my mother of lying it 's a 30 filter that i bought for her to have clean water we order all the time from amazon and we have never had any problems i want the money credited back to my account immediately ! any now after asking for the refund which has yet to be credited they have the nerve to ask for the original boxes back still accussing her of lying i 'm having my mother email me her scanned copy of the receipt from the store she had to go to just to get a complete working water filter i am extremely disappointed in tarsal for not taking care of their customers i 'm the supervisor of customer service at a very large national retail store and we most certainly do not take care of our customers this way
this is a very filter we used to live in orlando where the water tastes like sewage so a good filtration system was a must this filter definitely cleans the water to drinking standards and the functionality is well thought out however this is one of the slowest water filters we have tried it starts off okay but after a week or so we wanted to return it because it took so long just to fill a glass we tried another filter and the same things happened a friend who was staying with us informed us that her pur had done the same thing so we went back to target and purchased a clear flow for the price of the pur and we could n't be happier it has the water flow and looks just as good on the faucet go with clear flow or brita instead of pur
i purchased this item hoping that it would make leveling and torting round cakes easier the blade '' a simple wire does nothing to work through a sturdier or crusty cake and in the process of trying to get it to do so the cake gets damaged i had nothing but problems with this item and had to use my trusty bread knife to repair the damage from the leveler ! i am back to using my knife to level and torte my cakes and feel stupid for wasting the money on this item my recommendation stick with the tried and true method it works perfectly every time
we bought some white wine glasses a while back and the metrokane rabbits were truly beautiful we use them over our reidels after my wife broke another reidel burgundy glass i ordered these they are huuuuge i 'm very serious when i say that an entire bottle of wine would easily fit into one of these glasses with room to spare ! there is nothing attractive about these monsters and storage is a big issue literally they would make a fine fish bowl
do not order these glasses ! i ordered them after reading about them in wine spectator well what they did not say was how big these glasses are ! ! ! huge ! ! i pulled them out of the box and laughed there is no way they would fit in my cabinets great idea no lead glasses but they need to be a bit smaller i returned them and had to pay shipping as amazon says it is not their fault that i do not like the item something to keep in mind
this is my first time to use an electric krumkake baker as i previously had the old type you use over the feel the baker does n't bake evenly on both sides top of the krumkake cookie is nice but the bottom remains on the soggy side which leads me to believe the heat is there is no indicator light to let you know when the cookie is done therefore you have to really pay attention to your time usually it took only 55 seconds to a minute also hard to get two cookies commpletely round batter ran into each other perhaps my batter was too runny but have used this recipe before on the old iron without 'm at the point that perhaps the single baker would be better than the double hope to find a person that could demonstrate the two cookie krumkake maker perhaps that would help trying to be !
i used to make these during kakelinna '' time in norway when christmas baking begins with my farmor '' paternal grandmother i still have my grandmother 's old cast iron krumkake iron and after trying this one i will never deviate from the traditional iron again christmas baking in norway is n't about making a lot and saving time it 's about family although the older ones take longer but taste better it is a great time to reflect if you have the energy to use a traditional one i recommend it the cookies are temporary memories are forever
hinky mechanism it takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open if it were n't so heavy i would 've returned it long ago
i have just purchased this chest the first thing i read from the packing box was this product is not intended to protect computer disks cds tapes videos this was not mentioned at all in product description on 3 to 4 website that i checked before i decided to buy it i was more than disappointed i feel that the seller was evasive
we purchased the lapinator plus for 30 plus shipping as well as the jumbo microbead '' lap desk for half that price 15.99 the microbead desk has a much thicker molded plastic top the microbead filled base pad conforms to your lap much better and is more comfortable it 's 2 inches wider 1 inch longer and accomodates my widescreen laptop better and it has two pencil wells and a clip on one end so it can be used for a lap desk without the computer again all for half the price of the lapinator the lapinator plus has a flimsy light weight piece of vinyl for a top a stitched edge and an uncomfortable foam base that puts my legs to sleep buyer beware ! check out the microbead lap desk first
i love having a combination machine however the espresso maker really really does not work well when you tamp down the coffee grounds it clogs up and the water ca n't pass through you end up getting about 2 drops of espresso at a time to make one espresso drink i have to brew it about 3 times it 's quite inconvenient i 'm just waiting for my machine to break so i can justify getting a different one
the espresso compressor broke after two months so we had to return the product the former was hard to use too never warm up milk to the temperature we wanted to be for brewing coffee it worked fine but then a normal coffee maker is enough to serve that needs
i bought this sofa about 6 months ago already i can feel all the springs in the sofa the springs croak loudly everytime someone sits on the sofa or gets up from it i have contacted target 3 times they do not have any information on the manufacturer and warranty on this product so if you buy this product you are on your own it is better to stay away from this product at all costs
i ordered several items from the collection texture leaves '' by corelle corrdinates and twice the casserole bake serve set was broken in shipment the other items were replaced and made the second shipment i recommend ordering the 4 piece casserole somewhere else or buying in a store
although the concept is excellent the execution is an utter failure the nonstick coating peels in less than 2 months the temperature controls are pretty useless the only setting that really works if you want to cook anything is high the paint that indicates the controls starts to wipe off after the first week of ownership at about two months after you purchase it you want to throw it out the window i would have given it no stars if i was able do yourself a big favor do not buy this product you will definitely be disppointed if you buy it i purchased one and thought maybe a just got a bad unit the second one was just as bad if they had spent a little more time on the execution of it and not gone so cheap on the coating and it actually cooked on another setting it would be a great product
ok im not a great pizza maker i donot know what went wrong but my top portion of the pizza browned but botton crust was not cooked properly i cooked it in a pan on stove after taking it out from the oven
we 've had our skillet a few months and now the nonstick coating is peeling off like crazy what a waste of money and natural resources it also makes me concerned about toxic substances that we might have been ingesting all this time terrible product they really should offer a recall it 's a good design idea they should offer it with a cast iron pan
this is hands down the worst electric skillet that i have ever used i noticed after the first time i used it that the coating was flaking off i thought surely it was just a fluke so i used it two more times and every time i used it after that i had to throw my food away because the coating flaked off into my food absolutely horrific
buying two of these yes indeed i 'm the biggest loser of all i was so impressed with how this looked and the i bought two of them they are equally horrible one lost it 's properties after the second use and the other became '' after the third use do not waste your money on these things there are cheaper and better skillets available if you really want one despite all these reviews please me and i will sell them to you really cheaply
do n't bother with this skillet the coating is after a couple of uses the coating starts to come off and you know it 's coming off on your food good idea from rival removable pan but terrible product and a waste of hard earned money
rival do yourself a favor a take this electric skillet off the market asap ! you should offer a 50 rebate coupon for every poor soul who purchased your junk product starting with me after 5 uses the heating element stopped working and could not be fixed before it broke the surface ended up with several of our meals you guys ever heard of a program i will not buy any of your products again !
this was the worst product i have ever purchased after two times using the skillet and once in the dishwasher the nonstick coating already peeled off of the bottom it went in the trash i would not waste my money on this product
i have used electric skillets for years and years i was so excited to get this new one because i thought the removeable pan would be a huge plus that idea was a huge plus but the pan itself was absolutely awful everything and i mean everything sticks to this surface you can actually see while scrubbing lightly that the coating just comes right off although that being said it 's no great loss because it did n't work anyways i definitely would not recommend this ! ! !
like the other reviewers i was impressed by this skillet until i used it ! this should be taken off the market so no one else has to waste their time ! how this passed any tests is beyond me ! it does heat unevenly sticks etc to cook bacon one should start with cold skillet but for this skillet you are supposed to heat the skillet for 15 min with the lid on first ! even holding heat is unpredictable it is just terrible ! they should be ashamed and really amazon should not carry this except for the fact that we can warn others about it via this form
these are the worst pans i have ever used they discolored after the first use be prepared to spend a lot of time with an sos pad if you want to maintain the color wearever stainless is a far better option
ordered almost a month ago never been shipped and it will take another month for them to potentially ship this geez i could have just bought this in the store for the exact same price rip off
the storage bag was too small despite saying it fit up to a 7 artificial tree
i have had to replace this carafe four times in one year if you accidently tap the carafe even lightly the whole thing cracks ! i ca n't stand this carafe but after spending 100 on the coffeemaker i 'm stuck with it for a little while
it needs to be further specified which models this fits not mine
this carafe does not fit despite the website 's claim that it fits cuisinart coffeemakers it may fit other models but definitely does not fit the
no matter how many times this pitcher was washed it still kept making the drinks taste like plastic after trying various types of liquids and always drinking exclusively out of real glass glasses i finally tossed the pitcher because it kept ruining every drink with that awful plastic stink and taste only plastic wo n't transfer taste and odor it 's surprising to see a good company like rubbermaid would use plastic for a pitcher of all things
you can buy a better product at an store this is a complete for naive cat owners please do n't waste your money ! you can do much better with a large bowl
it 's unfortunate it 's no longer heaiting after a year i was taking a good care of it so i 'm sad it seems half of the body is warm but the opposit side stay the room tempreture it 's not good for this price i guess i have to give it up
does not sharpen particularly well furthermore the cheap flimsy plastic cover constantly comes off when you drag the knife through definitely not recommended
i gave this a super bad rating a few months ago something to the effect of avoid avoid avoid at all cost '' which upon review seemed a tad the things is as others have reported this device will take a sharp knife and make it dull i 've never been able to get it to do anything other than leave unsightly scrapes down the length of the blade you 're better off saving your money for a good steel which is the only way i 've ever been able to keep a global knife sharp
i was first attracted to this interesting measuring cup by the unusual shape once i tried to use it however it was a really worthless measuring cup i suggest that you not buy it it has a tall slender shape that is and easy to knock over even if you are being careful it has weight markings for sugar and flour but trying to measure dry ingredients in a liquid measuring cup is very inaccurate so these markings are worthless the label claims to be microwave safe but it is made from polycarbonate and i have melted similar items in my microwave before i do not plan to test the microwave safety of this cup since it does not have a handle once you fill it with hot liquid you can not pick it up with your bear hands all in all a badly designed product that you should avoid
i followed all instructions and these bulbs did not grow even with proper llighting and water temperature i had no success the company however does offer a great guarantee but i did not pursue this
the heater does not give off the heat i thought it would you have to be sitting right next to it to really get any warmth from it it does not have an element that radiates heat so there is n't a lot of heat for the fan to send out i would honestly recommend spending a little more and going for a larger unit i did like the on and off timer feature though and the fact that it turns off if knocked over
like everyone else it seems the item i got was also defective and did not work only the rotation and nothing else not the fan not the heater boo
decided to buy the delonghi heater as recommended by consumerreports on being powered on the unit oscillated but neither fan nor heater started up i did make sure the 'safety trip ' was not activated this is located below the unit designed to switch it off in case it toppled over in short i put in the effort to make sure i was n't doing anything stupid since the unit 'looked ' fine nothing obviously broken a prior reviewer seems to have had similar problem but thought amazon 's package handling might be the culprit in my case the packaging on arrival was excellent return procedure for amazon was surprisingly smooth they even refunded the shipping fee for sending it back
at first i thought it was great the cat likes it and loves to watch it clear itself now the cat uses it to poo but not to pee there is way ! ! ! to much cat litter when it cleans itself it trys to pulls half the cat litter into the small cardboard tray i still have to clean the box once a week which i guess is better than three times a day i guess our cat poos a lot the poo does get stuck in the prongs from time to time and that is your que to clean the tray out i also do n't like that the cat really shuffles the litter around before he goes so it sets the sensor off and we have to shake the box often or just push the button to get it to run that is kind of anoying i think they really need to make some adjustments to the box but if you have an older cat that does n't dig a lot or poop a lot then this is the box for you be aware though you will most likely have to clean it every week i had to actually flip the lid around so the cat would push the litter away from the tray he was helping push the litter into the tray so it would fill up clean litter and the poop would get stuck in the grid all in all it 's not to bad !
great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken amazon how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer does n't pack them well enough for shipping amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic i 've received two of those lovely surprises the first set i ordered and the replacement set oh boy i give up ! the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard they break ! amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement in this case so it 's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage are you feeling lucky if so then roll the dice
saw these canisters and fell in love with them could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive
they are a lovely color but i do n't like the fact they are n't zippered they slip off constantly
it looks attractive but i was markedly disappointed with the lack of sharpness in all the knives i find myself reaching for an old set of knives to cut up vegetables if the fruit or veggies are nearing ripeness the kitchenaid knives will not cut through them at all
i just recieved my knife set 4 days night a knife was left in the sink and it is up with would recommend not getting this knife set i had at 60.00 never rusted in the 10 years i had on you kitchenaid for selling bad products
this with a doubt one of the worst can openers i 've ever owned ! ! i bought it because it is attractive and will accept tall cans it is attractive but not very functional it is so very difficult to get the can positioned just right so it will open that it takes 5 or 6 tries just to get it to work the lid catcher '' blocks your view of the mechanism so it 's almost impossible to position the can properly in addition when removing the can the cutting arm mechanism slides off the opener most of the time do n't but this poorly designed product ! !
if zero stars had been an option that would have been my rating i am currently on my third yes third return of this tank luckily i got it from a petstore otherwise i would not be able to afford the shipping for all of the returns thank god i filled out my warranty card ! on all 3 tanks the filter stopped working despite my weekly cleanings of the tank filter and magnetic spinner as well as changing the filter cartridge as suggested if not sooner i will never buy a marineland tank again
i would have bought this item the first time i saw it if not for the lack of information other pages have a list of items included in the package whereas this one has none who 's to know what you 're getting i suggest that this seller at least place an overview of the items the recipient will be getting when ordered
i have several visions pieces i only keep them because they are handy to use in the microwave on the stove the only thing they are good for is boiling water they heat very unevenly and develop terrible hotspots if you drop them or the lid you stand a fair chance of shattering it the fact that they are transparent has never been useful to me
this product is n't worth this review but will give one ! the containers split easily the holders falls apart if you look at it wrong i had a few containers left and tossed them all do n't try i
after a while you 'll never get those rugged concentric grooves '' clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear i 'd never recommend circulon cookware because of this especially since there are so many pans on the market
this vacuum cleaner is great in theory in practice it appears to have been designed by someone who has never actually had to use a vacuum cleaner under realistic conditions my kids hate using it because it is so bulky and inflexible even though it is substantially lighter than our previous cleaner often you have to vacuum over small ordinary bits of thread and lint many many times before the cleaner will grab them i guess it 's some consolation to know that in the meantime it is sucking up invisible microparticles forget about vacuuming under furniture ever again the hose is held in a long inflexible cumbersome wand that prevents you from working in small spaces the suction causes the hose to collapse upon itself the bagless suction is great but it belongs in machines designed by people who have already come to grips with all the other things a decent vacuum cleaner needs to do we would never buy one again never recommend one and have had frequent cause to regret this expensive purchase
i ordered a set of these sheets and originally thought they were very comfortable after 3 nights of sleeping on them they began to pill so badly and be uncomfortable that we returned them to amazon we were sent replacements after 2 weeks and a couple washings these also pilled and were terrible these were the worst quality sheets i have ever owned
elastic snapped on first the feel like cheap cotton and not sateen
after only one usage and washing pilling of the material made reusing them uncomfortable when i tried to return them i was refued because 30 days had expired we had n't used them until then i have a balance in my account to use other than that we will not be buying from amazon anymore imagine if we were to buy early gifts for someone which had been in our plans also i have since read other complaints of the product with similar responses yet you still sell them
i have purchased many sheet sets from amazon and have always been very pleased this set however is the biggest disappointment ever not only do they not feel like sateen but they pilled '' terribly under me after just one night should never do this ! what a waste of money they now sit in my closet i do n't want to put them back on my bed doing so would feel like i was punishing myself i purchase up to to reward myself ! with the excessive pilling i would n't even want these if i got them for free do n't purchase these sheets
feels nice fresh from the package despite the loose threads sewing i 'm sure after 3 washings they are starting to pill they have also shrunk and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze definitely not and definitely not egyptian cotton waste of 20
this crock pot has 3 settings warm scalding and blast furnace warm cooks nothing scalding evaporates liquids and drys food in less than 2 hrs and blast furnace should be used in place of kiln the worst feature drawback of this unit is the hot water spitting that occurs after 2 or so hours that leaves your countertops wet and messy i returned this and bought a rival far better no comparison
well i guess i 'm in the minority here but following to the letter its instructions for the 4 cup brikka the coffee always seems to boil in the top chamber no matter how low a flame i use or how quickly i get it off the stove when coffee starts coming out the top if you like strong burnt tasting coffee this is the machine for you i wanted to like the brikka but for under 30 bucks try an aerobie aeropress recently got one and i love it and compare espresso results for a great cup of strong coffee it 's very hard to beat the french press
despite repeated cleaning and even removal of filters this vacuum lacked the suction to pick up all but the finest dust after only 1 month we threw it out
when i found this listing i thought the extreme power stick vacuum '' meant the suction was powerful i apparently was wrong this vacuum wo n't even pick up dust bunnies off the tile floor purchasing this item was a waste of my time and my money
when i bought mine there was no reviews i have the same problems as the other reviewers have feathers poking through i was suckered by the low price stay far away from this product
from the dates on the reviews below it seems we all got suckered by the low price but this product it horrible the package labeling says it has a 210 count down and feather proof '' shell but if you want to experience this product without buying it just throw a handfull of straight pins in you bed this stupid thing has drawn blood i am requesting full refunds from amazon for both sizes that i ordered and may even speak to an attorney
like the other two people who already commented my blue ridge 2 '' baffle box feather bed queen size looks good and is nicely priced i purchased it as an amazon 'deal of the day ' item but unless you enjoy feathers poking you all over you should avoid this product at any cost i have two sheets one flannel covering the product and i am still being uncomfortably poked
looked good but the feathers are constantly poking you even through the flannel sheet ! i 'm going to cover it with a mattress pad and then the sheet and hopeully that will correct the problem
my collar stopped working after 3 months innotek does n't honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer which does n't include amazon
this product i bought and not only did the top break when i opened it the wipes dried within a day so badly i had to reseal in a ziplock bag the wipes leave a milky film on my stainless steel refridgerator that i buff off with a mitt designed to clean stainless steel i got from bed bath and beyond alone this product does not work as they say i do n't recommend it
i bought these because i liked the idea but the wipes always leave streaks and dry out too quickly i definitely wo n't buy them again
i 've tried this product many times using different methods and every time i end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances i 'm not the only one do a search on google and read a ways it seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product others recommend using weiman 's or bar keeper 's friend on the plus side it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you do n't mind the streaking
this step stool is not worth it the steps that are shown extended in the photo connect only via a plastic groove in the red plastic cross bars shown on the legs of the stepstool therefore when you move the stool the steps flop along you have to move them out yourself and put them back in yourself they come off too easily so you are having to place them inside the groove whenever you move the the stool itself is very small and while this is ok for a stationary perching stool it is not good for a step stool and too small and uncomfortable as a seat
i opened this mixer and it was broken i shipped it back i did however order another and it was in great condition
this machine has plenty of power but the beater attachments leave '' of unmixed on the walls of either bowl i do n't have the blind love for the idea '' of the kitchenaid brand that most of the gormet buyers have it is n't worth it unless you need to be seen using one to fit in with your friends it 's a great deal in dollars per pound and old world '' charm i have actually gone back to using my 60 consumer quality mixer i think this mixer really shines when you bolt on the or attachment on the pto sticking out the front
i returned the set it was not the quality of the revere ware i 'm accustomed to i have some revere ware that is years old and it 's night and day to this new stuff i instead purchased a used older set at auction which was cheaper and is heavier and much higher quality and made in the usa not indonesia as the new set was disappointing too that i had to pay shipping both ways as they you the shipping for the initial free shipping '' as well as the return shipping
this is the worst vacuum we have ever had it does n't pick up pet hair what the heck it does n't do bare floors it sucks up and chews up persian rugs it is self propelled you have got to be kidding me ! i have to push this thing harder than any vacuum ever i went to wal mart and lowes to get a new belt for it this is the belt we have gone through in one year and neither places have it now what it is a very heavy vacuum bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya it is by far the loudest vacuum there is a super loud droning sound that sends the animals wild each time you turn it on in a small room it is absolutely deafening ! i hate it i do not recommend it if someone on here does they are lying to you ! this is the worst vacuum we have owned i can visibly see dust and dirt shoot out the back when i vacuum even after cleaning it out so much for the hepa filter ! ! ! do n't buy this vacuum you will want to throw it through a window like i do and even my husband wants to do ! !
pros bagless works well at first cons breaks down frequently the tubes often become blocked despite emptying of the canister in a timely manner burning rubber smell and had to replace the right now my vacuum is sitting in the middle of the living room i want to vacuum but i ca n't it is ! it is n't as if i use it all that often so to have it break down so much is quite frustrating do n't waste your money on this cleaner
this design was flawed i mean it was sorry you lose suction there is too much cording at the bottom i had to use a coat hanger it is is very unreliable
there i think my title best describes how i feel about this piece of junk ! read all the have the same complaints from the cord up to the handle this vacuum leaves me cussing every time i use it and i am not that kind of person but this just brings out the worst in me i especially love cleaning my house but ever since i got this vacuum i dread the day i had to clean my house knowing how painful and horrible it will be i should have bought hoover instead my last hoover lasted 11 years before i had to buy this garbage hoover may be a bit pricey but it sure as hell 's worth it
my wife and i received this vacuum as a wedding gift before we even celebrated our 2 year anniversary the vacuum had completely fallen apart it wo n't stand up on its own 2 screws have fallen out of the base the house smells like burnt rubber every time we use it i have to use the attachments to suck up anything bigger than a cat hair and the plastic guard on the front is completely detached furthermore everytime we vaccum the hepa filter trap opens and i have to put it back together before i can resume after reading other reviews i 'm glad i 'm not the only one whose had these problems i did n't pay for the thing but if you 're planning on it my suggestion is do n't buy this vacuum you 'll be shopping for another one within 2 years just like me
i never received this mixer i ordered it in good faith and was told it was in happened did you sell it to someone else
i 've owned any number of villaware products in the past and have always been happy with their quality and longevity this product has not lived up to that reputation the heating element has failed on this unit after only about 6 uses in 2 months
when my husband and i first got our waffle maker we could n't believe how well it worked at this price point nothing could be better a couple of months ago the lock that holds the waffle plate upright while you 're pouring batter and removing the waffle broke in the middle of using the waffle maker it slipped to the side and burnt the inside of my arm three months later i still have a scar and i can no longer in any way recommend this waffle maker i 'm going to purchase something slightly more expensive kitchenaid that hopefully has more of a focus on ensuring that parts continue to work if you do choose to buy this be careful
this scale is a piece of junk ! every time i would put food on the scale and get a reading after waiting a few minutes the number would change ! or i would weigh an apple once and get i would weigh the same apple again and get i would weigh it again and get 5.8 ! it drove me crazy even when i would zero the scale out after a few minutes it would show a negative number i returned the first one and asked for a replacement i thought it was just that particular scale but the replacement scale did exactly the same thing argh
i totally agree with the last review of this scale by the time i weighed out the next ingredient to be added to the bowl on the scale the display showed grams more i even delayed the time between adding ingredients hoping the scale would settle on a single weight i tried using different types of bowls plastic glass metal but it made no difference the buttons are inadequate it is hard to discribe the button design because the right front edge of the scale is labeled on off tare you may turn the scale off trying to tare the weight of the last ingredient this usually leads to a loud expletive i purchased this scale based upon the good reviews this product had as well as the fact that this scale is from the same company that manufactures the most highly rated but very expensive scale i 've found however based on what i know now i would never recommend this scale to anyone i guess i got what i paid for a cheap scale
i 've gotten into bread baking and many of the books recommend measuring ingredients by weight instead of volume so i bought this scale it 's very affordable and made by what i considered to be a good manufacturer i did n't think though that i would meet a scale that is so temperamental and indecisive i always place the scale on a level flat surface but when i put something on it to be weighed the readout fluctuates anywhere from tenths of an ounce to an ounce or two going up or down and not really settling anywhere i have to wait a minute for the scale to make up its mind about exactly how much the object weighs i probably should have gone to a store to check out the actual design of the scale before i placed my order instead of individual and tare buttons this scale has on '' off '' and tare '' marked on the front edge of the scale and you are supposed to press down on your function of choice and the edge kind of buckles down and activates hidden buttons inside the mechanism bear with me here this is weird and hard to describe ! and it does n't work very well either sometimes pushing down on tare '' turns the scale off i do n't know why they did n't opt for simple straightforward buttons for the functions but there you go the button that switches the scale between to metric is on the bottom of the scale while it does n't particularly bother me one time i did want to weigh something in one system and switch to another too lazy to bust out the old conversion formula and i had to remove the item turn the scale over flip the switch and start the weighing process again i think i should have returned this and bought another model that would have made me happier this was a lesson in buying gadgets without physically checking them out this scale looks good on paper and has a very affordable price tag but it 's not the best digital scale out there more than half the time i do n't feel like dealing with this wishy washy scale so i just measure out my ingredients by volume which indeed defeats the purpose of why i got this scale in the first place
please be advised that the description provided herein is misleading they claim to measure within 0.1 oz increments when in reality there is no decimal reading on this scale it measures in 1 oz increments only
after owning a number of thermos ' and other insulated bottles this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break ! parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner 3.90 and 8.60 respectively cheaper to get another carafe after buying 5 total during the past year i 'm down to my last one thats it going to another manufacturer i did prechill the carafe before filling with and ice i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour followed carefully with ice upon putting the cube in the bottle the glass liner loudly shattered i have never seen liners break so easily i did notice on the last bottle i have left before using it the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe i took it apart and hand tightened everything so far okay this is the last carafe i 'll buy that is zorirushi made
this product is poorly designed it appears to be very sturdy but soon broke the case itself is very heavy but the cutiing wires are flimsy and quickly broke mow i am left with a very sturdy inoperable tool you should sell replacement wires
i was very excited when my arrived out of the box it looked good after that it was all downhill the first problem was with the pressure it dripped liquid into the cup that was the rinse cycle the coffee cycle was worse nothing but slow drips with a rare drizzle the second problem i had was with all those coffee grounds in the coffee of all the coffees i have had and believe me that was a lot i have never seen so many grounds in coffee i ran the rinse cycle several more times trying to get the pressure to work nothing improved i ran a whole container of water through it with the same results every time i went on line to find answers capresso 's web site was zero help and they really do need to answer their emails good luck to you if you need to contact them the third problem i had was the noise wow ! is that a lumber mill inside the machine ! are they putting out a fire in there after the coffee finishes its dripping the bottom line is this for 1300.00 there had better be rockets shooting that coffee out it should be at least what they claim same as a professional brew house espresso maker or 18 bars this machine is clearly not the coffee grounds need to be reduced a lot my french press has fewer finally the noise has to be less than my 15 grinder i am not impressed at all my 150.00 espresso maker put this one to shame too bad the idea was a good but the needs a lot of work my is on its way back
i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it well that chance did not pay off even in combination with the model my cat continued to spray everywhere if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it
we purchased this and the diffuser on recommendation from our vet we have 4 cats and one insists on pooing once a day outside the box otherwise she always uses the box well it has not helped
i got 2 bottles it does not work and was a waste of money cat attract cat litter works better
i think the machine was great at first it 's fast and eficient but if you have more than 5 meat to grind and you do n't want smoke coming out from the motor you might want to give it a break in between plus the cutting plates and the feed screw turn rusting and black even you put cooking oil after wash as directed by the instruction book and they have this smell on the cutting plate that contaminate the meat i am very disappointed
i tried it and the meat got stuck i had to disassemble and clean multiple times to finish grounding two pounds ' of meat ended up returning it
buyer beware ! ! do n't bother buying this terrible quality if you bought one at a local dollar store you would be better off and a lot easier on your wallet
nice looking mug and no spills but you better drink your coffee very fast terrible insulation system do n't buy it
beautiful mug and the coffee stays hot when they say leakproof lid however they really mean it even in the open position nothing comes out ! ! ! ca n't figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid we have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of travel mugs '' i took advantage of the 5 year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem apperently as the gasket on the lid heats up it expands then the seal is just as tight as if it were in the closed position we are very unhappy with this product and i wish to give it -5 stars
this coffee mug did not keep the coffee hot i would not make the same purchase again
when i purchased this item there were 4 dishes shown on the picture i ordered a quanity of 2 however when i received the items i received only 2 dishes not the total of 8 that i expected
i had the same problem as the first poster by all appearances this item is advertised as 6 souffle dishes heck the item number ends in dash 6 ! !
one would assume you would be getting six dishes as the picture shows six and the 4 10 and 14 ounce versions come in packs of six however i only received one and had to call amazon to correct this
i had this for 2 years and used it about once a month i was very happy with it at first since it was very easy to use however i found that it had no way of stopping when the cork had been screwed up high enough and it just kept going so that the cork would become wedged in the opener then it would break off and i would have to use a knife to try and prise the cork out of the device this happened a few times and the last time i just could n't get the cork out which meant i could n't use the corkscrew because it already had a cork around the top part of it after a while i had to throw it out
when i thought of oxo i though of great grips nice soft quality weighty feel when i got this corkscrew i was shocked to find out that it was flimsy black plastic looks like oxo in the picture but it is nothing more then cheap plastic bits oxo degraded their name with this product
i drink more wine than i sometimes like to admit and so i open a lot of bottles i 've used waiter 's corkscrews the fancy two prong kind the lever 'rabbit ' ones and the standard winged kind like this oxo version i have to say of every wine opener i have ever used this is the worst by far i love every other item i 've tried that carries the oxo name but this one is a miserable failure my main complaint is that when you line the screw up with the cork and the wings are down there 's nowhere to grab for stability when turning the knob on the top you have to kind of poke your fingers between where the wings meet and squeeze once you do get it going half the time it only goes part of the way in and you end up with a or worse broken cork terrible terrible terrible but the 2 winged corkscrew at the grocery store instead even better get a good quality waiters corkscrew and never worry about how you 're going to open a bottle of wine again
this corkscrew is flawed in several ways in spite of its ergonomic '' design it is awkward to use the screw is too short and often mauls the cork beyond recognition and reuse simply screwing it into the cork and pulling the wings down does not pull the cork far enough out of the bottle you have to wiggle wiggle wiggle it save your money
the water filter for the braun flavorselect 12 cup coffee maker model is a great design i rate it 5 for it 's design but since my original purchase of the coffee maker i ca n't find the filter units anywhere
oxo may have a good name but this is one terrible product sure it is very easy to turn but what good is that when hardly any product comes out no matter how you try to adjust it on the bottom we have to turn and turn getting hardly no pepper at all our money was thrown away in buying this pepper mill
this model is a nice little pepper mill relatively easy to fill easy to use and reasonably priced unfortunately performance leaves a lot to be desired turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse i would described it as cracked rather than ground turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work unfortunately i ca n't figure out what that adjustment would be based on other reviews i 'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue if it worked i would be happy as it is i 'm purchasing yet another pepper mill
this product did a terrible job of grinding and produced very inconsistant pepper grinds in addition it was very hard to keep peppricorns fed into the grinder without going forwards and backwards with the crank
this item is really overprice for a piece of wood with slots cheaply made in china you can buy the 19 slot version for 39.95 on amazon
this is rather a silly spatula the reason it 's silly is because it is a rather small spatula with an odd pointy tip a very tiny paddle and thus a very short paddle edge for actual scraping this makes it pretty much useless for various tasks such as say scraping batter out of a mixing bowl i may be missing some incredibly obvious use for this weird little spatula i suppose the pointy tip might be useful for scraping out the bottoms of mayonnaise jars but i do wonder how many people in this world go through so much mayonnaise that they would need an item like this on a regular basis the reason i got this spatula in the first place was because it was inexpensive and has silicone construction no places for gunk to collect but there are much better silicone spatulas out there for instance ones that are shaped like normal spatulas with a paddle big enough to get some actual spatula work done what better way to say i love you '' than with the gift of another spatula do n't get this one
the texture and feel '' of these sheets does not feel like a 600 thread count fabric even after several washings they feel coarse and rough i am very disappointed with this set
for 600 tc i expected alot more sheets started to pill after only a few days were not the soft quality that i thought they would be either felt like the standard 180 tc ones i returned them
i purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress the mattress probably measures 16 '' in depth the first time the sheets were put on the bed they slightly pulled from the centers the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well after washing the fit continued to get worse however it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners the original set of sheets that i had on my bed were from a different manufacturer and i was so happy with those that i could n't wait to receive these new ones unfortunately these 600 tc sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 tc ones nor are they as soft as some 400 tc ones i purchased thereafter overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price but if i had to do it again i think i 'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 tc set
i bought this treat ball with my aussie puppy in mind i wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate and something that she could n't destroy within a few minutes she had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes i replaced it my other aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute after the treat was consumed they got to work on the ball itself it 's a great item for my dachshunds but for the aussies and the german shepherd it 's hardly everlasting '' darn it ! i was hoping i finally found something that the little herders could n't immediately destroy
this machine is totally a waste of time you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes you would make the pasta in hours the mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture after lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture you get the second problem the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole if you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge
if i could have given this product a negative score i would have i purchased the lello 2200 pastamaker for my daughter for christmas she had just finished a culinary arts program and was quite keen on making homemade pasta the day after christmas we added the ingredients plugged the machine in and nothing after some investigation my husband who is an engineer concluded that the micro switch needed some adjustment he proceeded to make the adjustment so that the product would run our second and last try with this machine was tonight the switch worked perfectly thanks to my husband the kneading of the dough worked fine as well nothing beyond that point worked at all specifically we could n't get the dough to pass through the bottom of the machine through the disk rather the dough just spun around the bowl my daughter has made fresh pasta numereous times before and therefore knows what the consistency should be however just in case she had it wrong she added a bit more water still nothing we finally ended up taking the dough and putting it through a meat grinder to form the pasta bottom line the lello 2200 pastamaker went out in the trash tonight i not only wasted some money on this piece of junk but also wasted a fair amount of time trying to work with a total piece of junk
these glasses do n't have the heft or size to accomodate a serious whisky drinker cute juice glasses but not a cornerstone to your bar collectio
we received these glasses as a wedding gift through our registry when washing the glasses for the first time my wife cut her finger on a sharp spur defect protruding from the bottom inside surface of the glass almost invisible on casual inspection but quite nasty to be cut by
we bought three of these when our building 's boiler died and while initially we were really pleased a month later two out of three of them have died the first one was clearly not right from the beginning every time we turned it on it blew the fuse back it went to the store we figured it was just bad luck since the other two were fine but this weekend i went to turn off the second one and felt a huge shock when i touched the button later in the day when i went to turn it back on the light went on but not the fan or heater it 's dead the third one is still chugging along so i guess it 's ok but the thermostat never really worked on any of them we 've just used the setting end result do n't waste your money there 's no way of knowing if you 'll get a dud
my heater worked fine except it never heats the room to the temperature i select it is always five or more degrees cooler not very pleased ! do n't waste your money
they are huge and this is not indicated in the product description buy them if you want gigantic wine glasses i am returning mine
this thing is the biggest waste of money i have ever seen
i thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly it also hurts to walk on with bare feet having wood floors i hate sweeping times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box so i thought i 'd give it a try helped some but overall i 'd say not worth the money
1. when i open the box found there is a loose screw in the heater meaning the product quality control has problem 2. there is no handle to hold the heater 3. there is no second heat temperature selection
tried this in all my emerilware stainless pans and it wo n't fit any of them i had to send it back
the 3 quart steamer does not fit in the 3 quart pan
i see nothing special with this sharpener used it on a santuko knife with passible results tried using my sharpening steel on that knife and got the same results the steel seems to be more versitile
i was very excited about this product when i ordered it unfourtunatly the product did n't meet my expetations it is extreamly slow much slower than a george foreman which really surprised me also as another reviewer wrote it is very messy i never appreciated the design of a foreman until i used this the sides of the cuisinart do not extend past the cooking surface much so they do n't block any spray and when you open the griddler any condensation or food residue can slide off the back onto your counter because of where it is hinged in conclusion get a foreman
feeling sick already just by looking at this ! not a very funny joke ! do n't believer in but this is just not a good luck symbol for any place
the construction and stability of this unit is sub par at best save yourself the trouble and go to home depot and get their storage is much better quality and is about the same price
very wobbly and sharp edges on the edges of the shelves i cut myself bad enough to require stitches on the underside of the shelf i do n't recommend
after waiting for a month for this to come i opened the box and found it to be broken most pot racks are riveted together to make them stronger but the cross pieces on this one are just welded in with a very small weld which was broken in shipping fortunately it was broken when i received it rather than hanging it and having all of my pots and pans come crashing down and break my tile counter this is obviously a cheap pot rack and i would n't recommend it to anyone
i really do not understand all the fuss about this range i can only assume that because these rather silly pots and pans have a french name that people somehow equate that with cuisine quality i received a casserole as a gift which was lovely they look good and have a snob value and cache but they are truly awful ! they dry out food too quickly they are pure evil to try and clean and they are ridiculously heavy ! you could give yourself a hernia hauling one out of the oven my advice is forget the hype and stay practical in the kitchen ! incidently mine is used as heavy and special occassion only tureen a lot of money to shell out for a not very practical serving dish
i do n't know if this item is for kid 's lunch or what the bag itself is small and the mug is even smaller ! frankly speaking i ca n't think of any use of it with this size except maybe put in coffee but then why bother using this mug a regular mug can be much more convenient to hold anyway i just returned it regardless how much it costs it has to be at least useful !
for the most part this refridgerator has done a good job keeping the drinks cold and the size is reasonable small on the outside big on the inside perfect for the dorm room the interior is sound and the temperature is very cold even on the minimum setting so why did it lose three stars because of one minor flaw and one serious problem the minor flaw is that while the fridge keeps the things inside cold the top and sides get uncomfortably warm not enough to set anything on fire but definitely not the thing you want to put your bare hand on for long good if you want to keep lunch warm though as for the serious problem the pipe in the back gets really really cold after running this for three weeks my mother noticed that the fridge was leaking water upon further inspection i noticed that it was n't a leak it was water dripping from melting ice that had formed around one of the pipes in the back of the fridge just outside of the insulation that had wrapped around the pipe the chunk was about an inch and a half in diameter and looked like a chunk of white foam wrapped around the pipe it took me 15 minutes to ease the ice off then as i was inspecting the pipe under the insulating cover another chunk of ice popped out all told it took about 20 minutes to get the mess handled but i 'm glad my mother noticed the water dripping when she did otherwise i fear that the fridge might have short circuited and cost us 100 in the process
i 'm a huge fan and i thought that this would be the best splatter screen out there i was very wrong this lets so much grease through it 's joke sure it 's not as bad as using nothing but my entire stove is still covered with grease and the design is very annoying too you ca n't store it up against the inside wall of a cabinet because of the handle design which also is dangerous btw to lift it off a pan you have to grab it right over the pan as opposed to a handle extending out with grease splattering everywhere and steam and heat coming right out plus the handle gets extremely hot as a result of this design as well as it 's over the same heat as your food please save yourself and cleaning time and find a screen with smaller holes
i recently ordered these spice tins 4 sets what i received was 4 tins when you look at this set and read the description 12 pc spice tins '' you think you are getting a set of 4 tins per order right wrong i got one tin per order someone must have done a poor job describing this item because it is not the set pictured nor described the tins are nice but they are a push lid that i 'm afraid will soon loosen i wish they were screw instead the shipping was so costly that i kept them but i am going to make some noise about this order
i was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight it looked to be walmart type quality i would have been better off buying from linens and things
i share some bad experiences too i bought the on amazon and used it for 3 weeks it was working fine initially until i started using my capresso beans which were delivered to me just last week made use of the amazon rebate offer the machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee instead the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled the machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on i 've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the capresso customer service for assistance yesterday there 's no point calling the number since i 'm never home during office hours to go through the process this should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance other than that i must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient although i do agree with roell that it does look cheap
i was extremely diappointed in this simple can opener it does not work the gear and wheel will not cut smoothly and misses some spots i 've had to pry the lid of a partially opened can off several times
this is a real disappointment from a name brand that has built it 's reputation on quality how hard can it be to build a good can opener the blade gear that are supposed to hold the edge of the can do n't meet well if you do get it to cut it requires tremendous hand strength and multiple stops and starts leaving uncut gaps in the rim the handle is loose but ca n't be tightened you can buy 4 cheap can openers for the same price that will last you for years
it is hard to believe but it does not open cans seriously christmas morning with food preps well underway we discovered our brand new opener would not open cans unbeliveable !
i had this opener and tried it with about a dozen cans and it lost its sharpness and now it was in the trash can it 's expensive for such a gadget and did n't work
my entire kitchen is kitchenaid i bought this can opener three years ago it was awful difficult to use shredded the paper at the top of the can 's label and was very difficult to get started because i love kitchenaid products so much i assumed that this was just a defective can opener threw it away and bought another the second one was even worse ! it worked okay the first couple of times but now it barely cuts at all it grinds the top of the can making dents but wo n't actually make a cut once i can get it started i can not finish it because it messes up '' the can pretty badly this one is going in the garbage as well
i can not believe what an ergonomically and horribly working product this is the best thing i can say about it is that it looks pretty some others are satisfied so i can only surmise that there are vast differences in the quality of the products leaving the assembly line unfortunately this is going in the trash
i bought one of these about 6 months ago and it worked beautifully no problems moved out of state and accidentally left it behind so i replaced it with another will not cut at all i do n't get it was there a recent lemon run of these things
i purchased this item to store cereal items for my four young children this item is flimsy and cheaply made yet very costly i would not recommend this item to customers who have younger children it is not the only thing i do like about this item is that it color coordinate with the other appliances in my kitchen
this product seemed like a good idea i mix my own cereal and add lots of nuts and seeds so it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures the way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure and when full of heavy cereal disaster is assured also neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor i had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position if you take it off first then some cereal leaks out causing the problem i was trying to solve namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests i tried this product for awhile but threw it in the trash pretty fast went back to a big tupperware container not as convenient as this could have been but no awful spills either
ordred feb recieved a broken one soon after i returned it right after and now its the middle of april and it is still not here if you live in wisconsin they are 15.99 at a pick n ' save i give up ! i have bought several things from amazon and still have yet to recieve them or find out shipping info i have better things to do with my money i will now shop somewhere else ! ! ! !
as a blender this works really well it has a lot of power and the stir stick helps knock out air bubbles and keeps things moving the blades are well set so that i can wash it carefully without gloves and i 've never cut myself the lid is good and tight although at high speeds the suction in the center works the lid right off once you 've used it you know what blended food is lesser blenders just mix food the problem is the cheap aluminum metal covering below the blades in the canister peels off how about ingesting little shards of aluminum with your food i use mine every day but i wash it by hand with a soft sponge i 'm not rough on it but that aluminum covering peeled and little bits found their way into my food i realized it when i was drinking a smoothie something hurt my tongue i and went to see where they came from supposedly the warranty should cover it but i have to pay to ship it and i ca n't get l'equip on the phone or by it would actually be less expensive to just buy a new assembly than bother with the warranty for it but they have been out of stock on that for months i would not buy this again it 's too expensive to have had such a problem without a good solution
i have four sets that i received for my wedding they are beautiful plates but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use like heating food up in the microwave going through the dishwasher or serving hot food within 3 months several plates cracked down the middle making them unusable a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added i did a search on and found i was n't the only person having these problems everyone is having these problems plus it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces you have to buy another set what a racket the clincher is that they are located in indonesia so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent i 've gotten nothing but the international
i bought this item no more than two months ago and the motor in the fan already broke when it arrived the plastic casing was cracked well done amazon
i just now read the reviews of other customers and i agree with everyone who rated this appliance with just one star which it does n't even deserve i can see how if this thing even worked that it would be great but unfortunately i can not recommend this to anyone now i am stuck trying to get my money back my first one which i got for christmas also just stopped working probably overheated and blew a fuse plugged it in and nothing after about the use so i went through the whole of sending it back to the manufacturer salton they sent me back another shipping paid nice i thought but as soon as i opened it i understood that this was not a brand new model with the very first use it was already a ! the lid was defective not able to close properly and steam was escaping do not buy this brand ! ! !
this blender has been emitting a smell since the day i got it i thought it would go away but it has only gotten worse definitely does not do what it says it does all speeds perform the same what a waste of money !
i received this blender as a chirstmas gift i use it several times each week to blend bananas and milk that 's it it is now and the motor has already burned up it started with a burning smell and then progressed to bright welding '' light from the motor sparking being emitted from the back of the blender i am quite disappointed and have since bought a new more reliable blender
with all the great revues on this frother i thought i could n't go wrong buying one not so though ! ! after following instructions in detail the frother i received keeps getting stuck in the 'on ' position and also seems to have 2 speeds also just to prove a point more to myself i frequently have to take the off and press the button to get it to go fast i do n't actually use it to froth this way or use 2 hands to hold it and press the button which is very awkward and then even that does n't help sometimes the bottom line is that it will very seldom operate at it 's normal speed or it gets stuck on ! ! clearly this frother is n't working the way it should and is somehow getting stuck or the button does n't go down enough i was going to keep it anyway but decided to return it as i seem to have no control over wheather it wants to go fast or slow i really like that it has it 's own stand so i 'm very dissappointed that i ca n't get it to work properly this is a real shame as i was prepared to love this little frothing machine
the best thing i ever did was buy this pan because it was a cheap lesson to learn and i returned my larger set before opening the box this is terrible cookware i have this pan and the wok and tried cooking on it for nearly a year but am now so frustrated that i 'm giving it up i understand how to cook on stainless but still who needs this aggravation of burning food and not being able to clean the pans ! ! ! ! you can not cook an egg on this pan it 's a kitchen disaster ! save your money test with this pan first
i 'm an engineer and i can not believe that any company would in good conscience fob off such trash onto the consuming public the reasons for the faulty performance are all based on fatally flawed design a product with this many problems does not reach the market by accident they had to have known it was junk but chose to sell it anyway dirt devil deserves the strongest form of rebuke and condemnation
the dirt devil power reach sounded just great in the advertisements but has turned out to be a major disappointment while the product is easy to clean of dust and debris the roller assembly if worthless the brush stops in contact with any surface and does not perform at all even very light pressure from your fingers will stop the revolving brush you are simply left with a suction hand vac without the benefit of a brush i am sorry i bought this product
i used this model twice and promptly returned it the '' brush works only by the suction of the vacuum it has no additional motor this means that if the suction is ever less than perfect the brush stops turning and is useless actually it 's worse than useless because the brush then blocks the airflow and hampers suction so i would not recommend this model
the old dirt devils that i used to own were awesome they would last forever even when taking lots of abuse so i bought this updated one with high hopes what a mistake ! the biggest problem is that the agitator brush is rather than electric or belt powered consequently the brush stops turning whenever it hits anything soft high carpet plush upholstery and is even less likely to turn if the filter is clogged up from cleaning time to find a new
if there were a rating lower than 1 star i would have used it because this vacuum does n't even deserve 1 star in a moment of madness i recently gave my old dirt devil to my daughter and bought myself the new and improved '' model as a replacement big mistake my old dirt devil was a workhorse and was used to spot clean the upholstery and floors in our rv truck and car and home along with cleaning lots of other things such as draperies pet beds etc i used it daily for 15 years and never ever had a problem with it this new bagless dirt devil has never worked right immediately the revolving brush quit revolving i returned the vacuum for a new one the revolving brush never did revolve on it even right out of the box the vacuum loses suction within a minute or two because of the useless filter system the dirt devil company wo n't take the unit back and apparently they ca n't fix the brush problem either based on what i heard from appliance repair centers i contacted for service i 've already told my daughter that i want my old dirt devil back but she loves it so much that i may have to bribe her to get it out of her hands i told her i 'd give her my new one but she 's witnessed the problems i 've had and the ineffectiveness of the model and she said no deal '' save your money this is a totally useless dirt devil model the brush does n't turn and there 's no suction to do your cleaning if you want to throw away your money just throw it my way instead of wasting it on this thing
i bought the dirt devil power reach because it was advertised as having such versatile features along with a 6 amp motor it was the worst vac i ever used ! i purchased it specifically for vacuuming stairs and my car the suction on the tools and hose attachments was great when i used it in my car it worked well in all the crevices where dirt hides however when i switched to the revolving brush to clean the floor mats it was useless i guess i thought the revolving brush should actually revolve when in contact with carpet but this is n't the case next i tried it on my carpeted stairs with the same disappointing results the revolving brush stopped turning once it touched the carpet the removable head is an interesting idea however the hose was too short to make this feature effective i ended up dragging the whole unit around i do n't mind a bagless vacuum but the dirt cup on this unit was clumsy to get on and off without spilling and the filter did not shake off easily needless to say i returned it after one use
this fan would be terrific if it were quite once it starts to get a rattle it 's so obnoxious that it 's worthless
i have had this chair for 6 months now and i am dissatisfied the screws were stripped for the legs and after just a little use its rickety and shifts a lot i can not keep one of the screws in the leg and that leg falls off shortly after the screw falls out this is tras
this particular model is simply unsuitable for use as the girth of this glass is too large to hold securely although impressive visually the execution of this glass is poor as it is impractical for use safely and comfortably as an owner of many of the sommeliers series glasses from riedel the o '' chardonnay glass is a blatant disappointment this selection will be returned to the seller
these glases are too big for practical use instead we recommend the model
ordered 1 chair 1 loveseat and 2 ottoman recived in 4 seperate shipments at 4 different dates chair was first to arrive but did not have hardware or instructions to put it together been 3 weeks now and i have called several times you have to contact the manufacturer directly at least they have an 800 so as i call every day it 's not costing me anything loveseat came with a little damage that i can touch up myself overall for the price i paid for all this den furniture i would have rather seen it in a store and taken delivery myself
this trivet is plastic and not shure how it will stand up to high temperatures nothing in the packaging states this also i know that melamine does burn i probably would not have purchased if description had stated it was not stoneware
the toaster does not seem to cool well between repeated toasting cycles only with the heat control kept the same the second toasting is much darker than the first and the third will be almost burned
this toaster disappointed overprized and does not live up to the kitchenaid name toasting is uneven and edges burn easy i still regret ever buying it
i should have read these reviews instead of trusting the kitchenaid name when i bought this toaster from day one it has never toasted evenly any breadlike substance fresh frozen refrigerated bread bagel english muffin you name it see the photo i uploaded toast is burnt and raw at the same time ! ! pass on this one
i had this toaster for under 3 years when i came home one day and it smoked and died i have to agree that it did n't toast evenly but at least it looked cool and worked now kitchen aid wants me to pay 52 for a replacement which is supposed to be half price and i can buy it here for 63 i always thought people paid more for kitchen aid because of the reliability factor a one year warranty on a 100 toaster makes no sense i wanted something better than the 9.99 drugstore models and got a mediocre though cool looking toaster that lasted less than 3 years i am very dissatisfied and will not buy another kitchen aid product
this was a great toaster until it starting turning itself on after popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on kitchenaid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model yet do n't bu
i 've had this toaster for four years now it just started going down hill recently started toasting too darkly on the settings i had consistently used for years digital setting knob no longer works it is stuck on 4 only shuts off when manually popped up i have to agree with other reviews that said it does n't toast very even i 've noticed this in my four years of use so if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it if not try another with better reviews
total piece of junk expensive junk at that attachments hard to use cap seized would n't open for refill no reply from online looks sturdy and well made but it 's useless i wish i had read the reviews in this forum before i wasted my money
worked great for one week hope i can return it
it worked great the first time but the second time it was absolutely no good the cap seized after the second use and the whole unit turned when i tried to get the cap off it 's garbage now i wrote to them and the answer i got was a totally different answer for the question i asked
this piece of junk gave out after about 10 uses steam shoots out from behind the trigger making it impossible to hold
like many of the other reviewers i have experienced the same problems at first the steamer appeared to work however it soon began to leak steam from the hose and became very dangerous today the cap seized and would not come off the entire unit turns when you try to turn the cap i will call the company tomorrow and if i am not satisfied with the response i will file a complaint with the state atorney general 's office
i purchased one of the shark pro steamers and used it once came back to it a month later and the cap had seized totally shut they are aware of the problem but fail to document it or do anything about it the steamer is about 100 buck and to send it back for repair is 25 buck shipping and another 50 to inspect for that price i should just toss it in the trash or use it as a 100 paper weight that 's all it 's good for do n't buy anything from euro pro ! ! ! ! they make junk
what a piece of junk i bought this machine finally today as it was the only one available in any store near me and i did n't want to go with the 250 fantom one advertised on hsn or qvc so i thought i would try a cheaper one 100 is not cheap to see if these products work well i agree with anyone else who says it does n't work i have used it all this afternoon and get about 10 minutes worth of cleaning done with each load of water my oven looks still horrible as it did n't even attempt to touch anything caked on it ripped all the paint off the top of my stove and i have found out that is about 450 to replace the top of my stove to have it looking nice again thanks europro the only thing it did help with was my gaskets around the fridge they were black and really disgussting because nothing not even a toothbrush could get in there and they are somewhat clean but while cleaning it sprays filth absolutely everywhere so you end up doing more than double the work to get it looking somewhat clean but the filth it sprays all over your walls is not easy to steam off and i ended up having to use fantastic to get it off the walls i am going to take this back to the store tomorrow and get the 250 one as all the reviews i have read for the fantom is great sorry europro but your products do not seem to last more than a couple of days i also bought the shark cordless vaccum and although it was great in the beginning it broke after a few uses anyone who says this product actually works must have a spotlessly clean appliance to begin with as it does n't even come close to what they advertise on tv i will never be scammed again
i purchased these sheets for my daughter in law for christmas she washed them as directed and went to put them on her bed each corner on the fitted sheet the threads were pulling out very poorly made
sadly these lovely sheets are already showing threads after just 2 washes in delicate cycle a good purchase at the time but sadly not a quality keeper
purchased a set of the egyptian cotton sateen queen sheet set ivory color before the end of 2005 at the price of 39.99 here at amazon the package arrived on schedule however the quality of the materials egyptian cotton '' is far less satisfactory compared this set to a few sets of my other egyptian cotton sheets elegance 's sheet set is rougher and stiffer even after two washes i 'd say stay away from this item if you are looking for quality egyptian cotton sheet sets
they were advertised as having deep pockets but found it almost impossible to get the bottom sheet on my queen size sprained a finger getting the last corner on this was after only one washing in cold water smoothness was but too much work getting them on the mattress
i followed the instructions carefully washed only in cold water tumble dry extra low etc but these sheets still shrank also terrible pilling after only a few months i do not recommend the sheets were wrinkly but i could live with that but not the pilling which makes them uncomfortable to sleep on
this product is not worth its high cost the bubbles in the water gauge is a hassle i have to burp '' it with almost every pot the spring on the filter basket spout broke almost immediately i also have to agree that the coffee is not very hot i have used this for 18 months or so this product needs work
this was a wedding gift a little over a year ago with one time daily use the basket is broken it had been limping along for 6 months and has always filled the water meter with bubbles so i had to get used to knowing how much water i was putting in by estimation this is cheap i am so sorry my grandma paid so much for this unit she was trilled with it because she thought she was buying me a coffee maker i could have for a long time i will be buying a bunn
this coffee maker is not up to the usual krups standard the latch to open the coffee filter does n't always work everything on this machine looks and feels also why does krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase older model filters never fit in the newer models if you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line yes the instructions tell you not to you will burn yourself when you take the pot out the hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle i was always a loyal krups customer but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase
i ordered this pan beacuse i liked the old revereware pan i have had and wanted another i received this pan and could not believe how much lighter and of less quality it was as compared to the original revereware pan i have had for years i looked on the botom of the new pan and it is made in china is is a piece of junk i returned the pan i would not recommend this pan to anyone
i bought one of these recently the bottom warped after the first couple of uses making it useless on my glass top stove i tried to contact revere about it with no response
the other reviewer is right about old revere ware its great stuff that 'll last forever however newer revere ware like what 's being advertised here is total junk i own an old saucepan and a brand new dutch oven the dutch oven is flimsy and the lid does n't fit well if you want good revere ware make sure it 's from the usa not indonesia like the new stuff and old try yard sales or ebay the only thing to recommend new revere ware is the 25 year warranty that is the only way the old and new products are comparable
one of the mortars 3.5 '' diameter mortars broke just after a week i used it for nuts almonds and walnuts and hand washed it everyday
i purchased this ice cream scoop after i ruined one of the antifreeze scoops by washing it in the dishwasher the scoop works well however although it was advertised as dishwasher safe the inside of the scoop has begun to pit also the handle collects water in the dishwasher which slowly leaks out in the drawer i 'm tossing it
this was a great scoop worked well looks nice flashy but it started to degrade after a year or so at first it was juat a little mark inside the scoop but it grew i put up with it but now it 's rusting nothing worse then scooping out orange vanilla ice cream for the price i paid i would have expected this scoop to last longer yeah it 's flashy but i wanted longevity next time i 'll buy a cheaper scoop
like others the large burner is out after less than a year of use will look for another brand to replace
bad quality not so durable large burner died with 2 months of normal use i put this product in the trasher
we bought ours some time ago and have enjoyed it however the large burner does not work now based on the problems getting it serviced and the real possibility of yet another failure i plan to break into it and try to fix it even though it 's in warranty would definitely not recommend the purchase
i bought this frying pan as a gift for my mother and had it shipped to california where she is taking care of my 99 year old grandfather the packaging and papers were accidently thrown away she tried to use the pan for a roast on and set the dial to 220 to roast slowly when she checked it in a short time the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer no matter what setting it just plain got scortching hot there is supposed to be a one year warranty but amazon only takes returns in the first 30 days and in original packing i tried to contact them but can find no contact information on the web someone should replace the defective part but i do n't know how to accomplish this
the product that is being sent out is not the product that is pictured they are sending out an oblong platter with no handles made from stoneware it 's not even corelle extremely unhappy ! ! !
the machine was hard to assemble it never worked so it will be difficult to tell you how well we liked it
and i 've used a lot of grinders very badly designed and the custom '' thing is a gimmick and a sham it 's a standard rotary grinder they just added flashing lights and extra buttons and made it look bulkier every day was a misery dealing with this thing it 's designed so that you have no choice but to spill grinds all over the place when you use it
did not grind well and then after about 4 months died i wo n't make the mistake of buying a delonghi product aging
i 'm giving up on coffee grinders i had to buy this thing which did n't last long enough to grind the bag of eight o'clock beans i bought because the expensive cuisinart grind n ' brew 's motor failed save your money on both and grind the beans in the supermarkets machine you 'll be richer and happier for it
item worked for 1 minute before breaking very difficult to get the correct grind definitely an item to keep away from am returning as defective
i bought this oyster knife because i work in alaska and i have to shuck oysters daily i went to use it on the first oyster and it bent it took me over an hour to shuck 6 orders 36 oysters which normally would take we mins so i suggest that you do not buy this knife go to a local kitchen supply store and purchase one from the
it is preposterous that they would even call this thing an oyster knife this piece of garbage was literally destroyed after opening one raw oyster i could see that was going to happen before i even tried it it 's just a flimsy thin piece of sheet metal anyone who has shucked raw oysters knows how much torque it takes and how rigid the blade needs to be apparently these guys do n't know anything about that shame on grips '' for calling this thing an oyster knife
i wish i read the bad review before i bought this i may return it but it took me more than an hour to peel the sticker and cut myself in the process i have never seen something stuck like that before i got four items from amazon this time and the fact that they keep such an item in stock make me wonder i have n't had enough experience with it but look like someone else had and it is not good also it is a very simple utensil and sells for a good amount so you expect a good one all what it takes is one bad experience for me and i do n't buy again from the same site
the machine produces an extremely wonderful cup of espresso it 's main and constantly irritating flaw is this turbo frother sleeve it has too many pieces to clean and worst of all the sleeve does not remain securely attached to the the metal steam pipe several times i 've had the frother explode off the machine in a cloud burst of milk that sprayed all over the kitchen i 've had various other problems with this complicated design in fact the company provides a detailed additional page of instructions on how to troubleshoot with the frother sleeve which suggests to me that the company is already aware that the design is flawed i have to ask the question why not produce a simple metal frother that does n't break and require such special care this is the second gaggia machine that i have purchased this year the previous was a full automatic with a faulty sensor and this is the second gaggia that has left me disappointed i agree that the espresso quality is very good but i remain underwhelmed for the prices i 've paid given the design flaws i 've encountered
even though i am a fan of the calphalon cutlery line i really think they beat the pants off of the german competition this block leaves a lot to be desired the block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice and i ordered this block to house the additional knives that i bought it appears to be the same design but the quality control is awfull several glue joints were split open when i recieved the block and the finish was not quite up to par given the low cost i chose to glue and clamp the block into submission rather than to send it back but you might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with
the machine leaves water at the grout line i ha use a mop to clean the floor after using the floormate i have stopped using this i hope someone makes a machine to clean til
i bought this so i could easily bake small items without having to heat up a regular oven and because my trusty toaster finally bit the dust i can not get the lower heating elements to work so toasting takes twice as long because you have to flip it over i baked a small batch of cookies that would have turned out great except i had the tray in the wrong position too high to the upper elements and the tops were burned bagel bites i cook for my kids come out ok not crisp on the bottom but that makes it easier for my girls to eat i tried baking a small loaf of banana bread today and it looked beautiful until i turned the loaf out to cool it was completely raw on the bottom i ended up turning it over in the pan and cooking it again and it came out fine after that my comment is why have the lower heating elements if they never turn on ! '' i have read the manual over and over and ca n't find anything that tells me about the lower elements i sent an email to delonghi but i doubt i 'll get anything useful back from them do n't waste your money on this on the other hand it sure is pretty but that 's not what counts in my book
we had a rude awaking today our delonghi toaster was on fire i will never again buy any delonghi product the defective design is in the toast switch it is mechanical when it finishes toasting it sometimes continues to the always on '' position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast very very hot we literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames you were warned funny thing is delonghi makes an attractive product sad thing is they can cost you your house or worse
this machine is an accident waiting to happen in order to pull out the very hot toasting rack you have to attach a separate handle not only is this awkward and inconvenient we found after many attempts to attach the handle safely we were unable to do so since it attaches at an angle that requires on 's hand to come very near to or actually touch the extremely hot frame of the oven avoid this item at all costs
we purchased a delonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired we barely used this product when contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us my 20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years ! this is the lsat time i buy a toaster based on appearance
this is about the worst appliance i have ever bought okay it is fabulous to look at but unless you actually plan on using it rethink buying this model like another reviewer said the door swings down and hits the counter handle with kid gloves but here is the biggest problem to bake or broil you must turn on the dial as well as select a cooking temperature the dial cycles through a timer and completes the cycle in minutes then the oven shuts down i could not believe that this is the intended functionality because that would mean baking a chicken at 350 degrees for an hour would require the user to turn the oven back on every 4 minutes after the cycle '' has completed this is so absurd that i assume this is either a product design flaw or maybe my oven was defective i could not get an answer from delonghi as repeated calls to their customer service number went unanswered their product manual is very poor and did not help me either so thank goodness to amazon 's return policy i returned this and bought a cuisinart
first of all thanks to amazon 's return process this could be shipped back with little hassle the toaster has a door that falls open until the handle hits the counter just seems like the first of what could be many design flaws to toast a dial is turned which then clicks its way back to the start position it makes a cheap ticking noise as the dial is '' back to the off position if you stop the toast part way through the unwinding keeps going or you can force the cheap plastic knob to the off position i was not ready to keep assessing for design flaws i returned delonghi to order the cuisinart classic oven as it is a simpler and better built unit
despite the 3 settings this product is super loud even on the lowest setting when it 's on the second or third setting it emits a distinct unflattering smell additionally the product description neglects to give us the dimensions of this product it 's definitely large let 's just say i had to wrap both arms around this thing to carry it over to the living room because i could n't stand having it in my room because it was too loud finally i bought this item to help my severe allergies i was so disappointed when i had this machine on for a few days because it made my allergies worst ! i was sneezing and wheezing all night long i woke up with more nasal congestation than prior use of this overall i am very disappointed with this product
i bought this type of product in the past but it was a cotton material it works perfect i tried to save a few bucks and ordered this cheaper version and the first night i had it on it sounds like your sleeping on trash bags or newspapers like my girlfriend says the product works as intended quality is good zipper is strong but i just hope your a sound deep sleeper or you 'll be awaken everytime you move your head just pay nearly double more for the cotton version i wish i had this time around ! !
this pillow cover is terrible it is not made out of fabric but out of paper it is unusable unless you like rolling over and the crinkle of paper
i have not yet washed these and maybe my opinion will change with washing after just opening these they seem disposable '' and thin they are also very noisy each and every time you touch them forget about moving your head about on these if they do in fact help people with allergies then they are a great product but i was really looking for some nice soft washable pillow covers and these are not it they remind me of the blue disposable shoe covers that doctors wear before going into surgery also they do not look like the picture shown they are darker almost yellow and striped
this is a nice looking table for the price but my husband had a heck of a time putting on the bottom piece of the table the screws were way to short and just would not fit in correctly he had to go back out to the hardware store to buy longer screws ! ! plus thehole that the pegs fit into the bottom piece was not drilled in enough so he also had to drill a wider hole not to happy with the poor job they did on manufacturing these tables maybe we just got a bad one i dont know but it sure was difficult to match up pieces with the holes ! and putting the baskets together thats another story ! ! very frustrating ! table looks great in my home just a pain in the bum to assemble ! ! for all you single woman out there forget it ! ! ! !
like many say it has a nice design but functionally it is poor the glass jar has 8 parts the steel jar has 7 parts and glass jar broke within 6 months of light use i also second the fact that this unit is prone to leaking and as a professional chef i can tell you this is not worth the time or money as there are better products out there
i had never heard of bamboo cutting boards and was impressed by the pictures and advertisements posted on in addition in person the wood grain and various interlaying colors of this item are truly beautiful however i was very disappointed in the quality of the craftsmanship some of the various seams between the wooden pieces in the cutting board had large open gaps while others exposed wood glue that had leaked out and dried it also appeared as though during manufacturing some gaps in the wood were filled with glue or sealant creating an unsightly blemish on the item even more noticeable were areas located in various spots around both sides of the cutting block that appeared to be rough or exposed wood i do not recommend purchasing this item through the internet
we bought this vac because we thought it would be handy to use on spills that occur on carpeting this does not work at all on wet spills just smears them around making a bigger mess i would not recommend this product
i wish i had read the other review before i bought this item the listing is very deceptive on all of these strainer products as they indicate the length of the item who cares ! ! rather than the diameter of the strainer needless to say i am not a happy puppy ! i wanted an 11 '' strainer and got a 5 '' strainer ! how disappointing
the size of this item is not diameter its the length of the handle to the end of the tip on the strainer the diameter is inches but i guess it would strain rather well
after burning through several cheap '' vacuums i bought this product with confidence after my trepidation was eased by the great reviews i bought this 10 months ago and now it is dead i live in a house with wood floors and only used this to clean 4 of the rooms that had rugs the suction was initially great and at first use i thought it was broken until i discovered that the trap was full duh that had me sold but after the last time i cleaned it out it just died i 'm no dummy with fixing things but that is why i bought a good '' vacuum well 200 in the trash
had this vacuum cleaner for about 4 months before we started noticing that the room air seemed dustier everytime we used it at first i thought it was because of the gap of the housing where the electrical cord emerged from its housing i took a closer look and behold there is an half inch gap where the removable dust bin sits in the front of the machine it is supposed to be airtight as evidenced by the rubber gasket that lies superior to the plastic basket nothing on the machine is broken it just is poor quality control on the part of eureka by the way the other reviewer is correct they eureka customer service do not answer their phones you are put on an endless loop until ultimately you are disconnected
buy something else first of all it started out fine had good suction etc there was only one flaw the dusting wand did n't work it is supposed to charge and clean itself but that only happens if you can keep the thing together and i bet you ca n't it does n't take long for the power paw to stop working mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops the cleaner itself loses suction over time the dust catcher is easy to empty but do n't forget to buy all the filters it needs this is a poor choice
this vacuum cleaner is not good ! ! it hardly sucks up anything ! i used it on my room and it is so terrible that it makes me sad that i do n't have a nice vacuum ! i do n't have anything against eureka but this vacuum is bad ! my mom bought a hoover wind tunnel vacuum and it works just fine ! i 'm sure they try as hard as they can but eureka needs to make their vacuums just as good as the hoover ones
i bought this vacuum about a year and half ago and was very disappointed from the start i was excited to purchase this machine of all of the hype surrounding it my husband was against spending the money but i insisted boy have i been regretting that decision the first time i used it i saw that it did n't do anything better than the hoover windtunnel i was replacing it takes several passes to pick up the smallest crumbs left on the carpet by my toddlers it frequently passes over a piece of cheerio and wo n't pick it up this vacuum is so weak i can go over a small lightweight area rug without having to hold it down with one foot it also has a high clearance so you ca n't get under the edge of cabinets furniture etc i gave it two starts the hose suction is very strong and the darn machine just wo n't seem to die i keep hoping it will burn out so i can justify spending on a new vacuum just pass on this one folks it 's not worth your hard earned money
the dyson works well enough in the upright position but if you are planning on using the attachments prepare to be disappointed there is zero maneuverability mediocre suction completely awkward positioning and it is an overall nightmare the hose is stiff and ended up tipping the canister onto the floor scratching the wood and making me wonder why i bought the machine in the first place
the price is right but these stemless wineglasses are so lightweight that one of them broke in my daughter 's hand i was surprised at their thinness since they are made by a company that makes glass coffee and tea pots
yes i love these wine glasses for their look and their feel and their aesthetics but all that is for naught because yes they break way too easily just said goodbye to my last one out of four i already knew they were delicate when i bought them and so i took extra care handwashing them yet i still lost two to washing the other two broke when barely bumped against another glass at their low price i 'm still tempted to buy more but i can not it 's just bad design and i do n't want to reward bad design read the reviews we are not clumsy people lol yours will break too
these are really beautiful glasses and incredibly light we have no dishwashwer though and i broke one the first time i washed it putting the dishsponge down inside and i was being careful these are really really delicate my husband broke one the next day we also got the white wine version of these glasses and one was broken upon arrival still wrapped in its bubble wrap i have no idea why bodum decided to make these of such incredibly thin glass they 're really beautiful and we love using them but it 's ridiculous to have to be this careful with them i mean we have other wine glasses that i used to think were delicate but these bodum ones take the cake we also bought the bodum glasses and those are beautiful and much sturdier although they 're not for wine
i read the reviews and was sure that i 'd found the perfect honey dispenser but after a while it leaks they all leak i am stuck no pun intended with a honey ring on my counter the flaw is at the back of the spout the cut off cover does not reach the back and so the honey drips out
the second time we used the meat fork the handle snapped off
i bought this at a local store half a year ago as i liked the design but i should have seen this page before that as the first reviewer says i 've blew out the bottom maybe because i pumped it too much now the oil is leaking from the bottom and this is also really true in order to get a fine mist you have to pump it to the point where you almost blow out the bottom
junk will not pump after only a few uses
i ordered 2 one for olive oil and one for canola oil i rarely use them but when i do it is extremely difficult to get a decent mist one of the misters after being used maybe twice broke of course more than a month had passed so was not able to return
broke after less than 4 months a seal is n't holding anymore and wo n't hold pressure for more than a few seconds does n't seem to be repairable
desperate for an oil mister a few months back i checked around and found that no mister available anywhere on the web for less than 25 was getting good reviews almost everyone had something bad to say about the mister they 'd purchased when i found the norpro 790 on amazon there were no reviews but it looked nice and the price was right so i thought i 'd give it a try after a few months of use here are my findings pros good looking decent price stainless steel exterior rather than plastic good size works but cons like many misters you can blow out the bottom if you pump it too much in order to get a fine mist you have to pump it to the point where you almost blow out the bottom when pumped the cap will not sit flush ruins the look the nozzle itself is not of the best quality can be inconsistent in its performance for no apparent reason so overall it 's okay but nothing to write home about
this machined worked well it was quick until today we tried to use our rancilio espresso machine this morning and it would not heat i am reserving judgement as to whether i will be able to get this thing repaired under some kind of warranty
i have a panasonic microwave that 's worked perfectly for years the first trial of this popper produced good popcorn but a funny smell came out of my microwave now the microwave ca n't even heat water pretty upsetting to be out over 100 now no warning on the box about panasonic microwave ovens
i bought my first presto power pop many many years ago i loved it finally after so many years of use the plastic bowl developed cracks on the bottom so i ordered a new one the concentrator base on this new one scorches holes in the paper concentrators after only 2 uses with the old popper i could reuse about 12 times
i was happy with the sleek look but unfortunately it 's kind of the vertical rods that keep the paper towel in place are loose and bending and really no way to tighten ! nice looking until you use it then kind of cheesy the quest for a decent holder continues i 'm afraid
this towel holder is functional but flimsy the stainless steel is too thin at the base and the actual weighted part of the base is plastic as long as no one 's using the holder it looks ok but as soon as you try to yank a towel off the roll the base moves around and you get that cheap feeling
i bought this before christmas to use when cooking holiday meals and to try for potential gifts it turned out to be a bad idea first of all the clip for use with saucepans would not go on the probe and secondly i had a similar experience to the candy lady i used the thermometer to cook a ham from start to finish with out having to take it out and check the temp since it was a new thermometer i checked half way through with my trusty instant read digital thermometer and it was only off by a couple of degrees not to bad after the ham had been in an hour longer than the recommended cooking time i checked again and it was off by 20 degrees and the ham was over cooked i am returning this thermometer and looking for a better one
i bought two of these one for me and one for a gift i used it immediately to make english toffee the temperature never registered above 220 f and it burned ! i checked the temperature with my old candy thermometer with the mercury and it said it was over 390 so i took out the other one and tried to make another batch of toffee this time i used both this thermometer and my old candy one again this digital thermometer was always low so i am returning the both of these digital thermometers maybe they work well for meat but i do n't want to risk it ! i am very disappointed
i installed one of these in my aquarium this weekend and sat back looking forward to lush greenery in my tank the system is a sturdy canister in which you mix sugar yeast a stabilizing agent '' and water these do their thing and the gas comes through a tube down into a bubble track that makes the bubbles zig zag up exposing them to the water for as long as possible good concept and i 'd read pretty good reviews but here 's the problem the track affixes to the wall of your tank with suction cups which create a narrow gap between the tank wall and the track i noticed my tetras were getting in there but since they were getting back out i did n't worry then this morning i found one of the larger females firmly stuck i thought she was dead until i released her she swam off with an ugly red mark where the thing had caught her i hope she 's i removed this death trap from my tank and am seeking safer ways to diffuse the in my tank the canister thing is nice though particularly if you 're not handy enough to make an airtight seal with a diy soda bottle system it might get another star for that but seeing how it injured and could 've killed one of my fish i 'd like to give it 0. update after several aquarist friends insisted that i must have improperly installed my diffuser i tried again this time making sure the suction cups were squeezed as flat as possible and one of my friends checked it and assured me that this time there was just not enough space to admit even a small fish two days later i checked the diffuser and there was an otocinclus trapped behind it this one was dead find a better way to feed your plants
i 've had this fryer for over 4 years it 's held up fine but does n't have any of the features i think are important in a fryer the metal divider is ok but i never use it as i find the 2 compartments too small the lid is worthless my roommate accidentally plugged it in instead of a different appliance and the lid melted right off in just a few minutes a replacement lid is ridiculously priced after shipping so i just use foil but it 's a pain there are no temperature controls i bought a candy thermometer and the oil gets off the charts on the thermometer all the time i wish it were easier to control also the outside gets very very hot i 've burned myself accidentally bumping into it to sum up positives food comes out fine product has lasted years neutrals price is ok negatives no cool touch side insulation no temp control no fry comes only with a tiny scooper plastic lid melts you have to wait hours to put it on not easy to clean no parts come off so you just have to wipe it out it 's also hard to pour the oil out because you have to lift the whole thing this fryer is ok all in all but there are so many better ones out there for about the same price
very thin and it does not look as nice as it does on the internet i dont think it would hold up for very long since it is so thin
i just received the silverware and was blown away by how flimsy they are there is almost nothing to them and they bend easily
never received the product accoring to amazon it was delivered a week ago it was actually delivered to amazon not me ! not even a phone call i will never buy another thing from them
i purchased this because i thought that it would be a convenient fryer to own i thought that since it was one of the more expensive fryer available it must be good oil leaked all over my kitchen before i even had a chance to use it if you 're going to buy this make sure that the oil does not leak through the valve before you set it in the frame you may have to play with the valve a little to make sure that it 's tight i had to keep this fryer because it was too much trouble to return to amazon save your money and buy something less tricky
we used this fryer a few times and never quite got the food to come out as crispy as we wanted we attributed that to a learning curve about what oil to use and also the fact the we had never used fryers before a couple things we were willing to put up with that could be improved were 1. the light turns off when the temperature is reached would n't it be better to have the light go on when the temperature is reached 2. the light is in a bad viewing position all the way towards the back of the fryer behind a big knob so unless you 're very tall you have to tippy toe up to look down on it to see when the light is off we are '' and '' 3. there is not a digital of the current temperature of the oil but all those points became moot the other day when i made fries while the fries were enjoyable enough even though they were a bit soggy after letting the oil cool in the fryer i started draining it with the automatic filtration system i was impressed with the functionality of the drainage system as i watched the oil drain into the bottom tray then i got about my other business in the kitchen several minutes later i looked over and the oil had leaked all over my stove and floor ! ! ! there must have been at least two cups of oil that seeped all over my stove luckily not my burners since i have a very wide older electric stove with a space large enough to hold the fryer what a mess that kind of disaster does not warrant another chance in my opinion i 'm sending it back
you 're definitely getting what you pay for when you buy this even though i made sure to wash them right away and thoroughly dry them these pans rusted like crazy they also discolor easily the only thing good about them is they 're really cheap
i bought a plain rabbit a couple of years ago and though i liked it it did at times take a lot of strength to get a cork out then it broke in the sense that it would pull the cork but not take the cork out of the corkscrew afterward so i went shopping for a new rabbit and read a featured review quoting bad experience not unlike mine and recommending the le creuset screwpull '' though it cost more i did buy the le creuset and love it it is way easier to pull any cork than the rabbit ever was
this is a very cool product but there are a million out there these days and you can get them for as little as 10.00 ! they are almost totally identical they look just as cool they work just as well and the only thing that the do n't generally have is the fancy wooden box cost plus world market sells one for 20 and linen n things sells one for 9.99 some companies just do n't get the idea of appropriate pricing
you would think that after spending a hundred bucks on a wine opener that would be about it no after about 10 bottles the screw part gets dull and just pushes the cork into the bottle apparently the manufacturer does n't provide or sell replacements no luck on the web site nor through the machine has all the usefullnes of a dead bunny
the down from the comforter is coming out causing lot of discomfort and allergy
was very disappointed in this comforter while it is heavy like i had anticipated it is not soft in any way shape or form it is like newspaper it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long
this is not large enough or cuddly enough for a grown cat i have two cats and purchased two of these beds they wo n't have anything to do with the beds look at higher side beds and larger for adult kitties
had the original toshiba until it died no longer is that one made we bought the ugly round cuisinart which lasted for 5 years until it just quit working way too expensive to pack it up for repair so we decided to try this attractive chrome job it is difficult to clean often drips and is altogether unreliable because it has a thermal carafe i expected it to keep coffee hot for more than one hour but no luck so i have to force open the lid right after brewing apparently is gets vapor lock and transfer contents to another thermos i am on the prowl for another grind and brew probably a melitta and ran across this opportunity to review this ill designed cuisinart so decided to save some other folks the grief we have had with it only get one if somebody promises to pay you to use it
i do n't have this toaster but i have a delonghi and it sucks uneven toasting and slow with a name like delonghi you would think it was made in italy it was made in china be caustious of these other reviews almost all of them are from people who have reviewed no other items
the timer looks nice and the setting ring is indeed made of nice heavy cast metal but the way that you set it is stupid you start by twisting the ring this wakes it up and makes the hour numbers start flashing now you can set the hours but how many times do you want to set a kitchen timer for more than an hour to get to the minutes you have wait five seconds for the seconds numbers to start flashing now you can set it just as stupid when you hit the reset button instead of resetting the timer back to whatever you originally set it to it sets it to zero so now you get the pleasure of going through the whole setting process again you 'd think it would be hard to goof up the user interface to something as simple as a kitchen timer but they 've succeeded to the point where they need to print two paragraphs of instructions on the bottom get something else
positives are that it is a sturdy heavy loud and easy to read timer however while it 's easy enough to set it takes sooo long to set it compared to cheaper lower quality timers you have to turn the dial or press either button wait for the numbers to show wait for the hours to blink turn the wheel to the desired hours wait for the minutes to blink and then turn the wheel to the desired minutes does n't sound so bad but it takes a couple of seconds between each step before the numbers start blinking as others reviewers stated kitchen aid can do better
my kitchen is all kitchenaid so of course i had to have this but as other commenters said they can do better it 's a pain to set it 's angle is awkward and you have to be right in front of it to see the display and at the right angle i 'm short and the beep is n't that loud there 's no clock in it either the metal band around the outer rim corroded too so it does n't look nice anymore i have a timer that 's got the clock 2 timers a button to set seperately and shows you how long it 's been since you missed the beep that beeps for over a minute i use this one more i think it 's an older west bend model
a nice heavy timer but even when i put it in the same room that i 'm in i usually do not hear the timer if there is any other sound going on voices tv radio etc i 've had two other timers that eventually wore out from use i rate this below average
these are not at all what i was expecting to me these are tiny bowls they measure 5 inches across top
recipe cards come in two sizes and i was so excited to receive my recipe box but when i opened it i found it does n't fit either size or recipe card i was so upset ! the smaller cards swim in it because the width of the box is far too wide for them and the larger cards are exactly of an inch too wide to fit into the box and as i was looking it over to see if i could make it work somehow i noticed one of the little wooden caps that hide the screws was carelessly missing the combination of those two problems made this box the biggest waste do n't buy it i even went to the craft store to see if i could find some wood and screws to widen the box myself so it would fit but i found it was actually cheaper just to buy another box from the craft store i ended up getting a lovely wooden box from there and gave this awful imposter of a recipe box to my daughter to put hair clips in
i have 5 cats all who got along very well as they were from the same litter when i adopted another cat 2 years later it messed up the balance '' and everyone started hissing at each other i tried feliway because of all the great reviews i read on a couple websites i used the product for 2 months but finally decided to stop my cats had always used their litterbox even with the newcomer in the house because they had separate litterboxes a couple days after i plugged in the feliway they started peeing on the rug in the living room on the couch the sofa bed and finally in my own bed ! ! i tried everything to get them to stop even to the point of throwing out all my bedding yet nothing stopped them the hissing got worse they started having little cat fights '' which they had never had before and after 2 months i finally unplugged the 2 feliways i had purchased note that i changed the refill every 30 days as suggested it 's been a week now and things are a little better but not back to the way it was before feliway i think it will take some time my advice to you be very careful to monitor your cats if you use any artificial products these things do n't work for all pets
i should have listened to my sister the vet tech instead of people who swear by this stuff i see no noticeable improvement but it was worth a try next step valium for me and the cat ! !
my husband and i purchased comfort zone to alleviate bad behavior from our aggressive kitten that we recently adopted from the spca it was very expensive and there was absolutely no change in our kitten 's aggressive behavior we plugged it in and a couple of days later as i was passing the electrical outlet that contained this i noticed that it was leaking oil all over the outlet ! i immediately unplugged it and threw it away like throwing 40 dollars in the trash just glad our home did n't go on fire
this was an overpriced useless product did nothing close to what it promised after spending 49 ended up trashing both feliways
i know and love raclette dinners from my home country germany so i was happy to find some that will work in the us i tried to find out what the dimensions of the raclettes offered are but without success there was no answer to get anywhere the dimensions listed on this page are obviously bogus amazon can not be contacted and swissmar does n't answer to emails so finally i decided to just order one and was really disappointed this raclette is much smaller than the raclettes i 'm used to from home the size of the grill plate is just 24 cm x 36 cm the dishes are just 8.5 x 8.5 cm the dishes are all lined up to the two sites you ca n't turn the handles of the ones at the end to the front sides if you sit around a rectangular table the guests at the front ends of the table will have trouble to reach theirs this raclette might work for 4 persons but is not suitable for 8 as normal european raclettes are
i purchased these and hand washed as stated i placed them on a cookie sheet and made a batch of while they were my smoke detector went there was n't any smoke that i could see '' but it set it off when i opened the oven there was some but i thought perhaps it was some baked over food the cookies took longer to bake by they also had a strange taste to sort of like plastic i later tried using these but put breaded fish on them and in a within minutes of the oven coming to temp smoke was pouring out of the i had to take the whole pan and food out onto the porch as it was very toxic smelling and smoke everywhere ! ! i would not recommend these to anyone and i am going to try contacting the company with my problem hope this review helps
i order 'd this vacuum after reading other reviews one hour after placing my order i happened to find the identical vacuum a target store and was extremely disappointed with its quality i came home immediately to cancel my order i spoke with two customer service reps and was told that i would receive an within 24 hours to confirm the order was suspended after notification was sent to shipping twenty four hours later i rec 'd an notifying me that the vacuum had been shipped i was very upset at this news as i had purchased this item as a gift to be sent to someone who is not capable of handling such transactions on her own and i now had to suffer the inconvenience frustration and embarrasment of handling the mistake with her and the shipping carrier usually i am thrilled at the speed of service from amazon with all other transactions i just wish there was more than a two hour window for cancellations
this thing looks and performs wonderfully out of the box the filters capture that disgusting vacuum smell and its fun to watch all that dust and pet hair swirl around in the translucent box then it quit working i figured that was the retailer 's problem not mine so i returned it second model did the same thing and broke after about two hours of use i had to bang on it and manually spin the rotating filter to get gobs of dirt dislodged a gob '' is approximatley one pint i removed gobs '' so this model has failed twice not what i want from an appliance that costs close to 300 and should last 10 years also the attachments do n't stay put and the little plastic keeper for the hose is in just the right spot to snap off on your thigh and the handle broke on my first one come to think of it this damn thing is pretty junky
this vacuum worked for about before the brushes stop turning i took this to a authorized hoover vacuum dealer to look at after finding the problem was some bent pole that supported the brushes to work they contacted hoover only to find out there is a recall out for this vacuum cleaner model and the part was not available yet for the repair so after purchasing this vacuum on february 2007 the vacuum is still at the repair shop later part is still not available stay away from purchasing this vacuum i only kept it since charges you a fee on open merchandise lyle m
this percolator would be great except the lid was too tight and extremely difficult to remove after only about a week the gasket around the glass window in the top cracked from having to pull the handle so hard to get the lid off and coffee leaked out through the break as it perked i called customer service and they said they 'd replace the lid but it is on backorder i have been waiting for over two months now i do n't know how you are supposed to get the lid off without using the handle though so what 's the point
this unit made rich coffee that was not bitter after 3 months of use the base power contact became defective and the unit would not work i contacted delonghi who denied warranty because it was not purchased from an authorized '' seller they claim the base can not be bought seperately and my only option was to buy a new one from them at 150.00 what a gang of retards i will not buy another delonghi product again
i have waited for years to buy calphalon cookware because i was under the false impression of its quality i had an old set of waterless cookware made by ecko the ecko set outperformed calphalon in every measurement my thought for buying the new set was ecko cheap calphalon quality every thing sticks in this set pork chops even stuck to the so called surface pan and no the chops were not right from the fridge that would cause them to stick some of the pans without coating had dimples in the metal the box states they are dishwasher safe however the instructions state differently on an electric stove one of the pans developed burn marks on the bottom of the pan over medium high heat the list goes on and if you contact customer service you get canned answers to send the cookware to them at your cost they did not read mine oh they did tell me i could keep the lids no wonder they do not fit you can move them about '' back and forth do not buy !
we 've used this rice cooker not more than 3 times it was put away and we forgot about it for a few months and then realized that we were eating lots of rice why not cook in the rice cooker when we took it out to use it it was dead does not work at all i 've had good experiences with black decker before but this one sure was n't would not buy this or any other b d rice cooker again
i agree with the below ! why it is on the necessary kitchen gadgets lists '' i do not know ! it just sits collecting dust in my drawer especially with its sticky material you still got ta place a good amount of pressure on the garlic to mash it when you could do the same with a flick of the wrist with the flat side of a big knife ! waste of money
i ordered these for my mom who has several different items of the corelle coordinates when they arrived the color was no where close to the ones in the picture the picture appears to be a bright almost fire engine red color in reality it is a dull color my sister also bought the same set for our mother and again the cajun red was the same and not the bright red in the picture i can say that both sets did arrive undamaged and seemed to be packed well the bakeware itself if very nice to use however i 'm rating it one star since the color was n't even close to what i expected
i was very impressed by their size they were a bit unmanageable though the first one broke which was my fault although a sturdier glass would have been fine and then the second broke when i was cleaning it with a sponge i clean lots of things with a sponge and that has never happened i do n't have huge hands and i did n't rough up the glass or anything it just broke i do n't know how i did n't cut my hand during that experience
enough is enough i bought this heater and it failed within two weeks when it fails the light will come on but neither the heating element or the fan will work thankfully amazon is awesome at returning products and they had another one in the mail before i even put this one in the mail to ship it back the new one arrived and it ran for about a month before stopping when it failed it failed in the same way as the first one since it was spring i just threw it away and took the loss convinced that it must have just been a defective model of honeywell i ordered the quick heat ceramic heater this one actually worked for almost one whole year before dying last night in the exact way the other two did the moral to the story is this honeywell heaters are garbage unfortunately i begin this whole honeywell nightmare only after my holmes heater died after years of it running night and day during the winter spend the extra few dollars and buy quality which is not honeywell
if you would like this item to actually arrive then get it somewhere else i 've been waiting since late january
much thinner and cheaper metal than i thought revereware would ever produce i 'm very surprised and disappointed in how cheap and poorly it is made very thin bottom and thin coating of copper that does n't even completely cover the stainless steel the lid did n't fit because the pot was out of round but i could squeeze the pot back into shape now that 's thin metal ! also handles did n't appear to be centered correctly wish i had n't bought it but too expensive to return just because i did n't like it
i received this set of knives for christmas 2006 and the larger knife came defective and since they advertise a limited lifetime warranty '' i figured i go straight to the manufacturer for a replacement bad idea i contacted them in early january 2007 and no one got back to me then in early february i contacted them again when i called they told me to email them describing the issue i did and after a couple weeks and a lot of frustration i called back this time i was told to send an email oh what a surprise i explained that i already sent an email and i was told that they were going through some changes and i was assured that someone would respond to my email this time so i sent yet another email describing the problem but unlike the previous emails this one received a response the email asked that i submit their return authorization form which i completed and faxed back over two months later and i 'm still wondering when this knife will be replaced so what good is a warranty '' if you ca n't get in touch with the company so they can honor their warranty
even the ginsu is sharp and easy to use out of the box at a fraction of the price and it too has a lifetime guaratee SMILE seriously if you want to cook like rachael ray '' and invest in your first good knife set go to the store and handle several different brands and types before deciding to spend the money on these there are better quality knives available at this price learn about what the knives are made of steel stainless steel alloy and how they 're made i sincerely hope that fans are n't purchasing these knives because they are endorsed by rachael ray instead of investing in quality german or knives available for close to the same price that are used by true chefs if rachael ray respects her audience she 'd educate her viewers about knives instead of making money off of them hawking mediocre knives at a premium price
instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro this puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight great for holding air not great for holding items
the first time i purchased this it came with 3 glasses broken they quickly sent me another box well in this my second shipment 4 glasses were broken they need to write fragile or something on the box because the post man just throws it on the doorstep
i wish that i could give this item less than 1 star it worked well the first couple of times that used it after that it seemed to be hit or miss sometimes it would work fine others times it would n't work at all although banging it on the kitchen counter seemed to work at times i did n't even want to waste my time with exchanging this piece of crap for the same piece of crap so after owning it for approximately one month i tossed it it has to be the worst appliance i have ever purchased do n't bother wasting your time with this garbage
if you are looking for an ice shaver this name is well known but if you want one that lasts rethink this purchase recently my wife had gastric bypass and what helped her get her fluid intake was to chew on some shaved ice so i went down to the local target and got this product it shaves ice really well but not designed to last six days after i purchased it i exchanged it for another because the little switch stopped working seven days after that my wife just took it back because the same switch broke it 's well designed that youngsters can use but not built for use more than once or twice a week if that if you are looking for a ice shaver that can be used times daily do n't pick this model unless you have the time and gas to go weekly to exchange it for a replacement in other words do n't waste your time on this model
this stopper came apart when i tried to remove it during it 's second use when i first put the stopper in the bottle it was loose although when i opened it a few days later the seal was enough to cause it to break with a weak pull it also adds about an inch to the bottle height which could cause storage problems i recommend a stopper that has a lever on top that fits the stopper to the bottle opening and also does n't add as much height i had an inexpensive one from crate and barrel that worked great but i ca n't find it guessing it got thrown away
i am returning this product as it does n't work well as it is advertised it takes longer time as well dough sticks too i bought this assuming it will save my time but instead it increased my work and frustration when i used it once it rotis become thick too and uncooked this is not something which works for me and i would keep it i wanted save others time so that they wo n't try it and pay shipping charges without any reason while returning it back please do n't buy this especially for indian rotis
do not even think about it if you plan to use it for making roti the roti remains uncooked inside we also tried just for pressing out the dough and tried making chapati from flattenned dough on stove top that does n't work out either
my krups coffeemaker developed a terminal leak after 2 months so it was too late to return it or the 4 extra filters i 'd bought for it i do hate wasting money
i guess i am a slow learner i have bought two now unfortunately after two or three weeks of use the bottom of the filter begins to bulge and break away i use the recommended amount of coffee and a filter i do enjoy the coffee it makes when it is working correctly i have not found a stronger metal alternative filter for the black and decker
replaces the black decker homecafe coffeemaker 's pod holder only !
this set was very disappointing the knives are light and flimsy the blades are very small to tiny instead of eight steak knives they should have tossed in a bread knive or something the best thing about this set is the wood block these would be ok for a small '' person that does n't do much meal prep with knives i gave this set to my daughter as soon as i opened the box look elsewhere folks
these are great towels if you can get them they are very soft and a great price but i ordered them in december and they came in one at a time took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock when i ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship buy these only if you have a life time to get the
as of 9 dec 2005 the product picture shows the filter as being for a pur ultimate system but what is actually sent are filters for a completely different system 3 stage they will not work in the ultimate system shame on target and amazon for their attempt at deceit or ignorance in product visualization
recived one filter not two as advertized i will not do transactions with this vender again
i would not recommend buying this griddle the surface burned through the first time i used it making pancakes at 375 degrees i tried treating the surface again with additional oil before cooking pancakes again at 350 degrees the surface deteriorated even further and the third time i made pancakes they stuck badly to the surface and i gave up i am going back to my cast iron griddle
i remodeled my kitchen and purchased a ceramic stove top and was no longer able to use my cast iron gridle to make my tortillas so i was looking for something i could continue making them i finally came across this grill which stated that you could make tortillas on wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it does not work it does not get hot enough if you want to eat a raw tortilla then it works fine i called bethany housewares in cresco iowa and spoke to a lynn sorenson who identified herself as the owner she was a very rude person and does care about customer satisfaction she stated that since i had used the grill that i could not get a refund i stated to her that i could not tell if it worked by looking at it she then went on to state if you buy clothes at a store and wear them you ca n't return them '' that statement does not make any sense i am going to attempt to get this matter resolved through amazon if they ca n't help i will be out one hundred dollars their product is overpriced but i thought that if it worked it would be worth the money what is wrong with this world most people just care about the all mightly dollar i will make sure when i order a kitchenware or appliance again that it is not from kitchen kraft doing business as bethany housewares again ! ! ! ! ! ! boiling in arizona ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
it is a beautiful mold and i was excited to make a cake in the shape of a sunflower i am a pretty experienced baker and my success rate even with tricky procedures is very high in five attempts to use this cake pan each ime increasing how slavishly i greased and floured the alleged non stick '' surface and being careful to remove it per the instructions after cooling minutes on a rack after removing from the oven i never got it out in one piece the mold 's detailed corners are too sharp to cleanly release the cake i even tried letting it fully cool in the hopes some shrinkage would help get the cake out i own other nordic ware pans and have had better luck with them but this particular mold is a loser which was very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially be if it worked if you want to use it for jello i 'm sure it 's fine but for cakes it 's a waste of time and money
after reading the other reviews i am wondering if i have a defective model here is our experience with this machine we 've had a floormate since 2001. we loved our original floormate so when it conked out we bought this model it does not clean the floors at all ! the new and improved '' brushes do n't even touch the floor most of the time it does n't suck up the excess water as well as the older one so you 're basically just pushing dirty water around the floor we are so dissapointed we 've went back to cleaning on our hands and knees
i purchased this floor cleaner specifically to use on the white tile floor and formerly white grout it did a great job cleaning the tile itself unfortunately it did not make a bit of difference on the grout which is just as dirty as it was before i cleaned it with the hoover floor cleaner it looks like i 'll be on my hands and knees with the bleach and toothbrush afterall very disappointing
upon first removing it from the box i noticed that the set felt very fragile and it was the cup broke from a very slight bump the first time i washed it making the set useless the top part the teapot is not very attractive on it 's own and it dribbles when you pour it so you ca n't really use it anywhere you do n't want to mop up spilled tea for me this is a very disappointing waste of money
what a beautiful hunk of toaster but alas all style no functionality first the lever which helps lift up the bread stripped its gears approximately 3 months into use then the inside heating elements ceased to function 4 months into use and finally we tossed the unit when it began to smell like burning wires incredibly disappointed with service they do not stand behind this product
this toaster projectile ejects your toast right to the kitchen floor even if the toaster is located at the back of the counter by the wall i can not vouch for the toast we never got to sample any as they all were hurled to the floor avante '' toaster should be called the avalanche '' toaster that 's what you get
my husband and i bought this toaster looking to upgrade this toaster was the biggest waste of money sounds like many other reviewers had trouble with their toast being burned but we could n't even get that far from the moment we took it out of the box we had trouble even getting the toasting lever to stay down after a couple of months it would n't stay down at all and we 'd have to stand there holding the lever down to get the toaster to work we recently replaced this toaster with a cheaper philips toaster which so far is working gloriously well stay away from
i decided to upgrade '' and spend more on a toaster too first one did not work properly one of the wires that holds the toast in did n't move with the lever and the toast tilted to one side and burned my second one the wires work but it does not toast evenly at all ! half the time portions are burned even at a lower setting of i do n't see it being a whole lot faster either i 've gone through a of bread testing it and i am not happy i appreciate the reviews on amazon and checked here to see the comments on this product it looks like the two good reviews were from a year ago so perhaps the manufacturing has gotten sloppy but my old cheap unattractive toaster does a better job than this ! do i exchange it again or forget it
not only does this toaster burn toast on one side even at low settings the force of the toaster has a tendency to projectile bagels and particularly toast onto the counter and if positioned close to the edge of the countertop on to the floor we are very disappointed with this purchase
based on all the glowing reviews here of this toaster i went and purchased one it does toast bread just fine but it is absolutely lousy on bagels and english muffins one half of the same side too dark and the other half of the same side not toasted at all figured that i had a bad one exchanged it for another and it does the same thing i am very puzzled how it can do so poorly on round items but it does tried inside in inside out always the half closest to back of toaster burns before the half closest to the front gets any gold at all
had these pillows for 6 months finally drained them and threw them out you do n't realize that once you fill them with water how heavy they are ! once they are in place on the bed you ca n't move them ! try lifting them when you change the sheets ! ! ! but you probably bought them due to a bad back neck or shoulders and now you have to lift these weights to make the bed ! what was i thinking i was lucky i did n't wind up in traction from lifting these things my husband refused to use it after a few weeks said he could n't get comfortable and was unable to move it easily they weigh a ton ! i hung in there longer but wound up using a regular pillow on top of it just to be able to adjust it without having to get a crane to lift it we honestly did n't feel any better sleeping on it and having to deal with the weight of them was not worth any benefits we might have derived no one mentions this issue in their reviews i have to wonder if they all have maid service
if i could enter a 0 for this product i would the back of the matress pad is slippery and moves when you turn in bed also the binding around the sides is this is by all means the worse product that i have purchased at amazon co
i got the timer and yes it 's heavy that 's about all the good i can say about it some of the numbers were scratched you have to turn it all the way clockwise to 0 and back again to get it set we tried it a few times and the timer would n't go off at all then it finally did and would n't quit ringing i had a lux for years before this one and it was very dependable until i dropped it on the floor i sent this one back and ordered another lux timer
for those who have electric stoves check out the dbl burner reversible item 3535 also available on this website it is from the same company and can be used on high heat over electric burners i have had mine for over 8 years and love it it is easy to clean up
the fryer worked good for like a week then the inside started to peel apart
do n't buy these baking sheets i placed one in a 425 oven and it warped causing a spill and mess in the oven
imagine the cheapest pillows you can find and then imagine a pillow one step up this is what you get from this product a '' product you can imagine not recommended for nightly use as it is poorly stitched and insufficiently stuffed this pillow has no support maybe it can go in the guest bedroom but even at these prices you can do better for your guests and do n't bother trying to return it to amazon either they 'll take all the value of it back because of shipping charges
the pillows are very soft do n't give any support to the neck not recommand it
my cats have showed no interest whatsoever in this toy but i think if i remove the corrugated and ball i 'll have a nice palette for mixing paints
this is a very expensive item for what it is a pump and a bucket ! it also has a few serious disadvantages 1 it circulates dirty water over the sprouts not a good idea 2 it is flimsy and unreliable the pump on my unit gave out 3 the spray spins around very unreliably it 's virtually impossible to adjust so that it spins consistently either it does n't spin at all or it almost blows the spray attachment off the top 4 the pump gets clogged up with gunge and yes i followed all instructions very carefully changed the water frequently and washed out the device 5 the sprouts are hard to harvest as their leaves and roots get stuck in the trays definitely get into sprouting it 's great ! but this is not the device to do it with
if you want to make 30 cups of espresso then go ahead and buy this it makes ok coffee if you want more than this though go buy something else from someone else the steam tap on mine jammed and it has been at delonghi for repair now for over four months yes months and i still don t know when it will be returned if ever customer service know or share nothing i have since done a lot of internet research and it 's littered with tales of disgraceful customer 'service ' by delonghi i wish i 'd done this before buying do n't waste your time and money like i did
i got this machine as a gift for valentine 's day i spent a number of years in seattle and am a bit spoiled when it comes to quality coffee drinks so my dh thought this would be a great idea it makes a great espresso and is very convenient it is now june and the black frother on the steam wand has fallen off and the threads are stripped on it the plastic part i called to get a replacement and the customer service was not helpfull at all when i told her i could not find the model the only thing was the logo with on the front and the ser on the bottom along with warnings written in several languages but no model number her response was ma'am there has to be a model number on the machine '' it 's there you just are n't looking for it '' over and over and over but could not tell me exactly where to find the number i practically disassembled the machine to no avail i will be happy to apologize to her for chewing her out if someone would tell me where on the machine i can find the mod she would not transfer me to a supervisor and i ended up calling back and leaving a message telling them what i need supposedly they will respond in hours so here i sit with a 150 machine that i ca n't use entirely my guess is their customer service is outsourced to another company and the customer service people answering the phone do n't know squat about the products they are answering calls about
these glasses sold for 23.99 on amazon only days ago now they 've jacked the price up by 10 what a ripoff ! i 'll never shop amazon again ! !
when the zyliss arrived i removed it from the shipping box i did not try to use the product until several weeks after receipt it has a slider button which does not slide perhaps that is the problem i have not been able to chop anything with it if i am using it incorrectly i am unable to figure it out unfortunately i discarded the shipping package which i recycled as usual if i can obtain packaging for this disappointing tool i will return it to amazon
the glass bottles are full of voids scratches non smooth glass surfaces i have returned mine for an exchange but the replacement is the same
i love this stockpot it has a nice bottom so food does n't burn the offset handles do n't get hot great pot for the money
i used my new pot to make fig pickle and it did a super job ! it is deep enough so i did n't have to be concerned with and as the figs and vinegar have to remain in the pot for a number of hours after cooking i decided a stainless steel pot would fill the bill i would recommend this stainless steel stockpot without reservation !
great humidifier noise not a problem keep it clean and it will perform well but the water tank is removable for filling and thats where any functional design consideration ended tank will not sit by itself with fill opening up to be filled and tank is slippery when wet whom ever designed this chose pretty not functional so close yet so far away
i was desperate for a warm moisture humidifier and despite the bad reviews went ahead and bought this one what a mistake after working fine for a couple of weeks the contacts became sensitive and i had to play with it a bit to get it to work that worked fine for another couple of weeks then it exploded all over my wooden floors i think that amazon should be held accountable for selling a product that is so obviously flawed and which they have perfectly good reason to know is flawed enough people have told them that it is
i really should 've done some research before buying this all of the reviews are 100 correct there is considerable mold growing under the water dispenser area despite diligent washing per week god knows this water is n't healthy ! in addition water leaks under the main water dispenser area so this is a huge negative lastly there are areas where the water does n't drain
throughout the years i have used and owned many different versions of the brita pitcher water dispenser all of these filtered water containers have been great the only complaint i have ever had with these filters is size the brita ultramax water filter dispenser was supposed to answer this problem unfortunately due to bad design it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past brita products pro size this water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water ironically this is really a disadvantage as you will find below con s mold if you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days you will get mold this mold will probably make you ill sore throat conversely if you look at it from another point of view it will strengthen your immune system to avoid this problem the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least to be safe you should wash it more often i have never had this problem with brita 's other products i have friends who never washed their brita pitchers for months and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it left over water due to the faulty design of the product there will be left over water both above the filter and below it besides turning the product upside down you can not dispense all of the water this is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product not surprisingly this helps further contribute to mold growth conclusion save your money and buy brita 's other well designed pitchers or even pure 's pitchers the key word is pitcher you will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product
sharpens knives but slowly with a lot of vibration and a razor edge is unattainable not much better than my old can opener that had a sharpening stone in a slot on the end
the service from amason and follow up was 5 stars but the product it self is not as good as i hope
upon receiving the sharpener i read the instructions thoroughly i attempted to sharpen standard good quality kitchen knives with very poor results in fact some of the knives that had a fair edge when i started were less sharp when i finished i tried several knives using the manufacturers instructions to no avail finally i returned the sharpener to amazon
nothing in the review said this would not work on a flat stovetop surface i just tried to boil water and it was bouncing all over and the water was splashing out i guess it would have been better on any other surface but i did n't find out before i bought it
i was greatly disappointed with this product it did not have the traditional heavy copper and stainless bottom and sides that i expect from revere it has just a thin coating of copper on the bottom which would not do an adequate job of distributing the heat which would translates to hot spots tapping the bottom sounded like a cheap tin drum i returned the product for a full refund i will buy my reverware from ebay from now on
i have had this for years and it is great to use i am a college student often cooking for just myself and find it very quick and nice my major problem is in its cleaning people may say it is easy to clean but it really isnt the lid only does not completely open making the top hard to clean and the whole thing is really just a pain i still use it but curse it afterwards i would reccommend getting a little more expensive model with removable plates trust me for the extra money it is definitely worth it i am looking forward to getting the new one with multiple removable plates
gears broke after 4 months same thing happened with the last one after 10 months am going to buy a bosch
there 's no real advantage over a vintage toaster oven besides it 's noisy as always it takes too long
i have been using gold coffee filters for years for all my coffeemakers however i was very disappointed with this one by krups i love my krups aroma control with stainless steel carafe but the swiss gold filter is far superior to the krups 049. you can find the swiss gold brand all over the web the 4 is the same size as the krups 049. a good gold filter will give you the best coffee because it allows the coffee 's oils to brew into the pot
this filter was purchased to use with our news krups coffeemaker i was skeptical from the beginning as the basket was flimsy compared to our older krups filter the filter cracked after two weeks i would not recommend
the zipper on these bags will not stay zipped therefore the air will not stay out of the bag and the bag will not stay compressed the first time i tried to zip the bag the zipper holder fell off i put it back on but it did n't help zip the bag i then zipped it by hand making sure i tightly zipped every bit of the zipper i used two extra large size bags one for a queen size comforter and the other for 4 accent pillows neither bag would stay zipped they are a waste of money
after 6 months of use the handle holder on the lid came off due to fatigue at welding joints since the other pieces also uses spot welding at the handle i 'm fearful for my safety and contacted sitram customer support this is their response '' while we have the ability to authorize replacement for the defective products that have handles coming off we are unable to satisfy a request to credit other product that has not shown signs of being defective '' in otherwords they 're not surprised the product is defective and i 'm not the only one complaining if i 'm stupid enough to buy a whole set then i 'll have to return each item as it falls apart too bad if the defective will maim me in the process stay away from this defective and inferior product if you value your health and safety btw i contacted amazon customer service and they agreed to accept the return love amazon
i ca n't get mine to even pierce the can takes 10 minutes of fiddling around to get it to pierce the can and then maybe it will open it half way save your money
this can opener is garbage it opened a couple of cans then quit if you pushed it along i could get it to open maybe half way around now i get nothing no matter how long you recharge the thing it does nothing more than make a grinding noise and stops does n't even start to open the can do n't waste your money
my mug arrived with several areas of glaze chipped off i 'm not about to send it back though because of the shipping charges i 'd be paying for the mug threefold if i did and probably would find missing glaze on the replacement i wasted my money the store that sells this mug via amazon did n't check the merchandise prior to sending box it arrived in was in a larger box with packing foam but the inner box that the mug was in was opened and was in bad shape not good for amazon either i hope the powers that are in amazon see this review
i have n't received the mug yet but the shipping handling fee for this coffee mub was 9.00 nearly half of the cost of the mug itself why was it so high if 's shipping and handling fees are customarily this high i will not be using your website any further joyce dea
really with a name like simmons i thought it would be a good purchase you sweat alot because its a layer of plastic sounds like you are sleeping on garbage bags i got a nicer one at target plush cover without the nois
this is a great sponge brush for people ! the sponge twists off when you use it in a direction as lefties are apt to do so i really ca n't use it the description says that all you have to do to refill it is to twist the sponge that 's true but to actually get more detergent into the handle you also have to remove the sponge so once you twist it it comes away from the handle for lefties like me this means a waste of time and detergent as well as a lot of annoyance i emailed oxo about this a month or so ago and never even received an acknowledgement it 's not an expensive item so i 'm ok with having spent the money but i am very disappointed in oxo 's lack of response so if you 're go for it it 's a nice kitchen tool if you 're a lefty keep looking ! i emailed oxo recently and after a second try got a response that the item has been retooled i 'll update this review again after i use it
bought this to cool my office desk i would say it provided a very gentle breeze i did n't mind that i do not like being blasted with a shock of air anyway but almost exactly three months after i bought it the cheap plastic shaft broke i suppose i could try to fix it the motor seems ok but it is just not good enough to warrant the effort one star for good looks
i bought this fan to use on my desk at work you literally have to be like 6 inches from the fan to feel any kind of breeze a few of the reviewers mentioned about two feet but no way my expectations were n't too high but cmon if your gon na make a fan at least make it function slightly better than this especially if your carrying the vornado name like i said i was n't expecting something powerful just a small fan to provide a slight breeze on my work desk this does not cut it at all i 'm giving it two stars because its actually a really cool loooking fan and its very quiet its a shame it does n't perform as good as it looks update i would like to increase my rating to 3.5 stars from 2. however i cant find an option to change it after using it at my desk it does an ok job of cooling me off when i tested it at home for some reason it didnt seem to work as well anyway as long as your within two feet you do feel a slight breeze i guess for 20 bucks you ca n't complain if it was a bit more powerful it would of been great
i bought this vacuum in 2005 mainly to keep the couches clean of dog hair this vacuum works ok but only gets a little bit of the hair cup fills up real fast my mom has a shark and that just sucked up the dirt and hair so i will probably replace this with a newer shark
the vacuum i received quickly overheated and became too hot to hold or handle the suction was great and the size very convienent but the heat from the motor made it impossible to use safely
i ordered this vacuum and was sent a cleanfast '' model that looks pretty much like this one i do n't know if cleanfast bought orca but i expect the same product i ordered i have n't opened the box yet to try the vacuum because i 'm considering returning it
yes this electric sweeper picks up some dust and lint from floor and carpet but it spews what it has picked up right back out again even if you repeatedly empty the waste container while you are sweeping you will end up with more dust and dirt on the floor than when you started you 'll either have to use another appliance or a broom to pick up what the sweeper has deposited or get down on your hands and knees to pick up what 's been left on the floor this product not only does n't do what it is supposed to it makes matters worse
i fell in love with the swivel sweeper at my cousin 's house where i babysit 3 preschoolers four days a week and could n't wait to buy one myself unfortunately i second guessed myself after reading some negative reviews of the swivel sweeper and purchased this more and more expensive bissell sweeper about 4 months ago big mistake ! i 've been kicking myself ever since the bissell sweeper does n't pick up nearly as well as the and tends to throw the dirt all over the floor usually to a place where you just swept the wheels and handle are stiff lubricating did n't help making it difficult to maneuver it 's bulky and too tall to fit under many pieces of furniture whereas the has a much lower profile the picks up most dirt on the first pass with the bissell i 'm having to constantly go back and forth over the same spot by far the greatest advantage of the is it 's ability to swivel 360 degrees at my cousin 's house i can stand in one spot and just swing the around on the hardwoods at it 's light and rolls beautifully the bissell 's wheels grip the floor and seem stiff a great disadvantage it 's like steering a truck you have to do multiple and parallel maneuvers to move it around sometimes it 's just easier to pick it up off the floor and move it to where you need it as for corners and edges the does a better job buyers of the complained that it appears junky '' and that there are problems keeping a charge my cousin has owned her swivel sweeper for about a year it 's used numerous times a day and she has had zero problems with it on the other hand the rotating edge brush on my bissell quit working after about 2 months as for the fragile appearance do n't judge a book by it 's cover the bissell looks great and appears sturdy and substantial but in my opinion is the lesser product by far
i have had this sweeper for several months and like others it 's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor laundry room and basement floors clean well it does pick up larger debris best but when you go for picking up hair dust and dirt it blows a lot of it around not to mention i noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes covered in dust do n't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to suck '' things up it provides no suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup i recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal rice etc as far as being a tool to clean '' your floors you will be quite disappointed in fact i only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it does n't get tracked in my upstairs
pros easy to use long battery life cons cat hair gets wrapped up into the coils and is difficult to clean out does not pick up all of the dirt and hair spits some of the dirt back out when you pull it backwards when you press the off button dirt comes out of it i will not buy this sweeper again
it works great when it 's charged but keeping a charge is difficult i experienced the same as a previous review even with a full charge it drains very quickly when being used no more than 5 minutes
i have bought two dust busters in three years they do work great for small things like lint and hair etc however at some point within a year maybe a year and a half with little usage a couple of times a week for a couple of minutes at the most it will not charge anymore you do get what you pay for and i will be buying from another manufacturer
i bought this for the little things and for that it as long as it does n't take you more than about minutes to clean up the battery on this thing sucks it takes a long time to get a full charge and a full charge means only about 4 minutes of battery usage save yourself the frustration and spend the extra few dollars to get a higher quality vacuum
for about 2 years with very light usage this dustbuster worked well enough its not powerful but for the price it helped with basic of dirty carpets after 2 years though it stopped charging now it ca n't last at full power which is only 4.8 volts for more than a few seconds i should have just spent more money on a better quality vacuum cleaner in the first place
i chose this product because of its dual functionality as a bread box and slicer the bread box works great it fits our homemade loaves fine and just barely fits a loaf the holes are also just the right size to allow the breath to breath without drying out the slicing 'rungs ' are a different story i have a sharp bread knife and was hoping the rungs would help me learn to cut straight well the knife slices of small shreds of plastic from the sides and cuts into the bottom the plastic almost always ends up on the bread
this item is not what i thought it would be it does not even hold a 1 pound loaf of bread it is not worth the price and i would not reccomend it to anyone
i really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients like cutting tomatoes however the thin material of the boards making the board rock on its center on the counter this combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping the only solution i have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it frankly that 's more trouble than it 's worth for now i am just using them for holding ingredients after i have prepped them on a better cutting board
this is the hoover i bought in less than 2 years the first was so terrible i threw it away this model broke after 3 months of light use it is impractical in design hard to lift to carry and obviously is not made to perform more than a few months
this is the worst product i have ever bought in fact i had bought 3 of this disaster and had to throw all away as useless its one function in life is to hold coffee and it ca n't do that because the lid falls off if there is even slight wind if you want to buy this product just flush money down the drain
one of the worst products i 've ever purchased the top is n't secure so that it leaks so much for travel
the good points the blue color is as gorgeous as it looks in the picture the metal interior keeps beverages warmer longer the sip hole is closeable but not the cone method is awesome for someone who only drinks one cup at a time and does n't want to fuss with a the bad points within twenty days of receiving the mug the lid 's seal was leaking and dribbling in two places from merely one use or less a day the bottom of the mug was not cut flat and wobbles dangerously making gentle stirring a production calling for help was a bear because of different customer service companies handling different melitta products the manufacturer refused to replace it because it was purchased online to sum up get the cone alone for a cheaper price either online or at the store i use it with another commuter mug daily and love it the melitta mug is junk
as the other reviewer said the brew cone works wonderfully throw away that fancy 150 auto drip that sings dixie this little cone will make better tasting coffee however the travel mug is a joke the lid does not seal or lock shut in any way all you can do is simply place the lid on top of the mug and hope it does n't come flying off when you hit a pothole while driving and do n't tilt the mug too far back when going to take a swallow because the lid might pop off and scalding coffee will pour all over you this has not happened to me yet but it has leaked and dripped out on me not fun however the travel mug is well insulated and can make for a suitable thermos for home as long you are aware that you should not drink directly from the mug while the lid is on
the quality of this isnt the sound of the waterproof '' material is loud i dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily i would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality
i 've bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use unfortunately this timer is an exception it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it 's round like a traditional kitchen timer it 's and has nice feet on the bottom the problem is the display it 's horrible for three reasons first the numbers are small smaller than any other timer i 've seen they 're about '' high half or less the size of those on comparable timers second the numbers are recessed '' or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface it 's dark in there and feels like looking down a well it desperately needs a backlight but there is none unless the light source is shining directly into the display there 's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers but that causes the third problem the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it 's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there is n't a reflection shining back into your eyes the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display not what i need when i 'm trying to cook it 's just not worth it since i have several other timers with displays i do n't have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight i 'd have to say it works very well i just do n't understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door
finally when it actually was over a year since i had received the coffeemaker when i called to check on the status of my warranty claim they said your warranty has expired you 've had this coffeemaker over one year there is nothing we can do '' i highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product ! i have a cuisinart now and it is wonderful !
we have had this machine for about 9 months the machine has been in transit and in the repair shop 6 of those nine months a friend wanted one but i told '' do n't waste your money '' this thing leaks froms the overflow above the coffee basket many reviews tell the same story the manufacture claims they are not aware of the problem one rep actually told me i must be lying as the machine can not leak as i discribed it is finnally fixed the next failure and it goes in the dump this was suposed to be a treat for my wife and it has been a nightmare ! !
i received this as a gift a year ago and i like the coffee maker part the coffee comes out with a good flavor albeit a bit cold but it seems all coffee makers these days make the coffee a little cold once you mix in milk or and it is only lukewarm the removable tank is nice you can wash it but awkward to use if you have the unit under a cabinet also the unit has a big footprint so that may be of consideration if your counterspace is limited i used to have a delonghi espresso machine that worked great this one has a steam driven espresso that most coffee connoisseurs will advise against i now know why the pressure builds inside the water tank as the espresso brews and after a shot the machine just shoots out steam i 've tried different grinds and tamping the coffee really hard you have to buy a tamper with this one it still builds too much pressure and it shoots out bitter coffee flavored steam after a short while also the markings on the pots peel off pretty quick not worth the money unless you get it for cheap on ebay
but alas i do not i got this as a gift and all i can say is gim me the gift receipt ! '' first some pluses i really really really really like the removable water tank that feeds the coffee maker you can pick up the tank like a basket take it to the water cooler and fill it right up i also like the fact that i can make espresso pretty easily no major learning curve now for the negatives within three months of use the coffee maker was spewing water all over the place and i do mean water not coffee i 'd fill the tank with 10 cups of water and only get six the rest would spill out or evaporate and while it was spewing and evapping oh yeah enough noise to startle people passing by in the hallway i use this coffee maker at work one other problem is that the coffee had a very plastic taste to it for the first 10 pots or so yuk also the espresso maker does a great job with the espresso itself but if you want cappuccino good luck getting the milk the way you like it talk about a learning curve i got every result from watery milk to neither of which is my preferred outcome all in all i 'd much rather have a separate espresso maker of better quality and my old melitta coffee maker now that baby makes some killer coffee
3 months after the warranty was over the steamer began to leak rusty liquid into the frothy milk upon inspection with a flash light in the steamer container i noticed that the metal parts were rusty and the plastic lining was flaking off i have had nothing but trouble with the company and would not purchase another delonghi product they do not stand behind their product and their customer service is terrible
i was sent a pacific coast brand comforter filled with about three feathers in n't waste your money you 'll just end up paying extra to return it
i actually ordered the national sleep products luxury down but was sent a pacific coast down comforter instead without explanation it was entirely too thin with large areas that were completely empty no feathers no type of fill at all not acceptable
in early december i ordered products from sharper image as christmas gifts half of my order did not arrive and i never received notice as to why turns out i had to call them to find out the items were on backorder i finally cancelled the order and a month and a half later they still have n't refunded me ! do yourself a favor do n't buy from these guys they 're comepletely disorganized
how do people say this works i would say this picks up of 1 particles at the most candle soot ! i have owned mine for 1.5 years save your hard earned cash and seek other filters with hepa my opinion applies to all ionic breeze filter
do not buy this product the one i got was used three times and it quit
this single burner lasted almost 8 weeks until it completely stopped working it took a long long time to heat up and i wished i had returned it after using it only a week do n't bother
this does not get hot enough to boil water no matter how long i leave it on makes it useless why bother with a burner if only possible heat setting is low '' and lower '' some customers found that it worked initially before developing its problem as to my experience i do n't have memory of mine ever working properly i bought this a few years ago and had it in storage not having need for it at that time then i pulled it out last month for basically its first use no boil water no go it is straight to the landfill for it annoying disappointment
the ad for this bed stated that it came with a hand held control to make it easier to inflate and deflate the bed instead it came with a motor that screwed into the bed which had to be plugged in and unplugged back and forth to inflate and you had to unscrew something on the motor to get it to deflate if amazon does not discipline this seller they are only hurting themselves
i purchased the gold filter to go with the krups programamable coffeemaker since on amazon it was something that people purchasing the coffeemaker were also buying i had n't had anything but a paper filter '' coffeemaker before anyhow this filter does not fit inside the filter holder on the krups programamable coffeemaker paper is the only option for you
this was shown to be compatible with the krups which it is not so i had to return it
the thing i hate about this is cleaning out the easy way is rinsing it out in the sink however it 's no good to have all these going through your garbage disposal otherwise it was a great idea
one reviewer said this filter does not work in all krups coffee makers as advertised what 's up with this krups
i was very unhappy to find that when i put the filter in the filter basket i was unable to close the filter door it was just a bit too high i have a aromacontrol 10 cup drip and i expected it to work as stated on all cup drip coffee makers otherwise i think i would have really liked it
bought this as a xmas present for my child and we used it a couple of times loved the idea cute concept worked with just ice cubes easy to use and loved the idea that it had the snow cone holder built right in we kept getting little white shards of plastic in our snow cones i cleaned the machine out twice and tried again still plastic shards called the manufacturer no response at all i wanted to love this machine it had all the makings of a success and had the manufacturer responded i might have even tried another to see if i had just gotten a lemon but no response thru email or phone now i am trying to find another one by a different manufacturer that wo n't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth from poor customer service or white shaved pieces of plastic
this machine worked great ! i used it about five times and was very impressed my kids loved it but after the fifth time it broke
disclaimer 1 i love my pots love love love disclaimer 2 i do n't own this but is n't three quarts kinda small to make cassoulet when i make it each fall it fills the largest of my roasters and even mounds over it i have no idea how i 'd get a mutton shoulder a pork shoulder a duck a pound of sausage and five when dry cups of beans into such a wee thing unless i had several of them
total ripoff the lid is too tight for bottle at this moment i can not use this item and i consider this item trash
the tupperware was useless because the top was too small for the bottom i am left to think that this seller is running a wish someone had told me before i threw 25 dollars down the drain
my main problem with this cup is the lid is absurdly difficult to get on i was amazed at how much trouble i had considering this is a name brand cup i suspected the problem could be me so i handed it off to a male to see if he would have equal trouble as well and he did the cap on top of the lid takes so long to coax into place that the only way i 've deemed this cup usable is to just leave it closed all the time other than that the cup seems to be fine the markings c oz and ml are clear and readable it is also easy to clean if using protein powder it is probably best to rinse it out right away though i can not say how it fares in a dishwasher if you do not want a cup that is a hassle to put together and you are just making simple shakes you will probably want to look elsewhere
although it says 6 qt '' on the bottom of the bowl it actually holds just a hair over 4 quarts i would n't consider this amazon 's fault but the description is misleading if i wanted a smaller bowl i would have ordered one
these dishes look very nice on your table but they have many problems after about a year my plates started cracking directly above the ridge on the bottom same with the bowls i have never been able to use them in the microwave because the item becomes very hot while the food is lukewarm if they bump each other while running the dishwasher they chip at least when i put them in they are ok but they are chipped when i take them out
the plates were warped and the color was off from the original set
2 years ago i purchased these dishes i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star 6 months ago all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half these dishes are microwave safe and no children all have broken in the same place 2 broke when picking up 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups bowls salad square plates are still in perfect but without my dinner plates my set s are useless ! !
we 've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip crack they are beautiful and affordable but they just do not last i had two plates crack in half in the microwave a mug handle break off as i slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack it 's too bad because i really liked this set
robust construction throughout but really lacks some subtle niceties that are found in less expensive bbqs there 's only two grill height settings and you cant easily change heights when the grill is hot and cooking the grill surface itself flips over to cause the height change there is a door provided to stoke the coals that appears to be a needless feature the hibachi 's feet are not insulated and can get pretty hot so beware of placement on surfaces the draft door is heavy and easily separates from the body the heavy door already tagged me once on the foot as i was emptying the bbq of ash really i 'd give it a 5 out of 10 for usefullness as compared to other hibachis that i 've used in the past conclusion the making of a cheap convenient and efficient cast iron hibachi bbq may very well be a lost art
i have to add to the leaks to the point of being useless '' reviews it 's not just a drop here or there either it 's too bad because it looks very nice
alton states on his episode titled raising the bar '' that he prefers a boston cocktail shaker over traditional ones like this so if you 're willing to spend a few extra dollars you will have a much better shaker
i just returned mine it leaked just as others have reported twice the top fell off while i was pouring my martini the first time i thought i must have put it on too loosely the second time i knew it was not anything i did its a shame that such a well designed utensil has such poor quality control
my number one quality in a shaker is that it does n't leak the oxo leaks and i am dissappointed in a brand that usually makes such good products i used it once and returned it
i was first drawn to this shaker for 2 reasons 1 it looked sexy as hell and 2 oxo normally makes great kitchen tools when i finally got it i was very disappointed the shaker leaked whenever i shook it no matter how tightly i held the cap on i love the way it looks and wish it was better constructed but ended up returning it because it just was n't functional
i bought this shaker and found that it leaks when shaken i ended up returning it and bought a boston shaker instead the boston shaker is simple to use and best of all it never leaks
seemed like a good idea however the arm is too strong so it actually squeezes the paper towel roll too hard so i could n't remove a sheet had to return it i suspect they did n't test one out before production and distribution i plan on getting a pendulum model next
i bought one of these at the target store itself and i loved it it fit alot of my cd 's dvd 's i soon needed another one and i found myself wanting to purchase the same one since i liked the first one so much but i had no time to purchase it at the store so i figured i 'd buy it on amazon and have it shipped to work i got the second one and it was totally different it looked like it was only painted once no second coat it did n't match the first one at all so i went to the target to look at the box maybe they shipped me the wrong color or something nope ! it was the exact same model and style i would't recommend buying this online because in my opinion it looks like they put it together any old way for online customers i recommend going to the store and looking at it first thank you chri
i have a reef tank but i 'm just not sure if this product works it does increase the calcium levels in the tank simply because it is a solution of pulverized argonite or other calcium compound i had great success with a part a b solution my father uses it and likes it but it does leave the argonite residue on everything and it has harden in the sump so when it is disturbed white flakes shoot out the return
it 's a small but kind of nice little microwave it does n't have all the bells and whistles that my old one had ca n't set or cook in the microwave with the timer going and ca n't set of cooking but you can change the power level while it 's going if you have set it for say 30 power you can change it while it 's still going it 's just a simple all together microwave surprisingly it does heat up better then i thought for the lower power it has and for some reason i have to keep setting the digital clock on there it keeps loosing time but that 's not a real importance in the cooking feature of it overall it 's a pretty nice little microwave but do n't expect it to do what a higher wattage or larger oven would do it does take a bit longer to heat things up but overall i kind of like it
stay away from this product the first one i got could n't keep time properly on a digital clock ! it was slow and lost a lot of time i returned it to target and got a new one it had the same problem i finally gave up and used it as it was i never liked the super loud beeping sound it would make as you press a button though too loud now the microwave broke completely wo n't run and i 'm having to send it back for a replacement
i 've owned a number of krups products including a 17 year old steam espresso maker and over the years have been consistently very pleased with the design quality and reliability of the krups products so i decided that it would be nice to have a new espresso maker perhaps one that has more options and can brew more a bit faster after looking at the various products and the reviews of the here on amazon i was somewhat concerned but nevertheless ordered this machine because it appeared to be about what i was seeking the reviews gave me some pause but in the end i dismissed them crediting krups for past performance and assuming the reviewers were just incompetent or were not patient enough to learn to use the product properly hah ! boy was i wrong my first clue that there was something different about this item was the instruction manual i am able to read several languages and was amused to see that the instructions while close were not the same in each language in fact there were recipes in some languages that were missing from the english version what 's that about then we i tried making my first batch of espresso i found that as others have complained i made a mess trying to load the filter the next disappointment was the brew i followed the instructions to the letter such as they are and the result was a pretty poor example of espresso the attachment for the milk was not much better and also made a mess i put the liquids together for a latt okay i was impressed with how smooth the taste was but the espresso itself was just plain pathetic weak especially compared to the output of my old machine so i gave it another try this time with twice the coffee and tamping it down more and created another mess this time the brew was stronger still very smooth but only about the quantity consternation was setting in then i discovered that the drip tray was full of liquid ! ! what the heck i tried every darn way i could come up with to brew a decent latt over the next couple weeks alas it was to no avail each attempt was disappointing in some crucial aspect i called krups and the very nice people suggested that if i was actually doing everything correctly then the unit must be faulty and i should send it in i knew that one of my attempts should have been somewhere close to the realm of doing it correctly so i doubt that there is anything faulty with my machine i also suspect this since my complaints echoed those i had read what a failure this thing is ! i am happily back to using my antique krups unit that cost me 49 17 years ago and the is in route back each morning i produce a wonderful adequately strong espresso and the steamed milk is perfectly frothed i should have been happy with the old machine all along i am so sorry i doubted the other reviewers
i have returned this item twice their tray is not pulling out so you have to out the water from it it does n't hold all types of coffee sometimes i had water coming out from the sides or straight into tray and i suspect that the pressure is not sustainable because i 'm getting different results sometimes coffee is good sometimes you just ca n't drink this
machine arrived dead on arrival none of the water would force its way though the coffee grounds and would go into the overflow had to send it back and would not reccommend
this product performs poorly within 1 month of receiving it water no longer flowed through the coffee after complaining to krups sending it for repairs and finally getting a replacement i am still not very happy with it the frothing part is unpredictable in its creation of quality foam krups did better with their older model of this machine
i ordered one which never worked the replacement did not work as well water does not come through the filter strange blinking of the lights just big frustration otherwise look very nice
this is my second machine in month the first was returned because the overflow tray started to jam the second machine now has the same problem as mentioned in other reviews this tray fills up very fast there 's a nozzle that dispenses hot water directly into the tray towards the back of the machine not sure why i think what is happening is that the hot water bows the plastic tray slightly but enough to cause jamming by jamming i mean i have to pull so hard to slide the tray out that i 'm afraid i 'll break it this is not just a minor annoyance since you 'll have to turn the whole machine upside down in the sink to empty the tray hopefully my experiences were the exception and not the rule or this problem can be avoided by emtying out the tray more frequently me personally i expect a machine to be thankfully i bought mine at bloomingdale 's so returning it will be easy i would not recommend ordering this machine online
i purchased the cat it fountain and for about months it was the greatest thing i could have imagained for my cats they were drinking fresh water and it was great for them they loved it very shortly however it began to break down the valve broke during routine washing the water never formed a continuous stream over the dome even after running my hand over the dome to release the static electricity '' i was lucky if there was a single stream but i took it because the water was at least getting cycled now 90 of the time my 40 investment wo n't even throw me the smallest of streams effectively turning my investment into an electricity wasting door stop sometimes when i am lucky and seat it just right it will give me a stream it 's touch and go just be warned
i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world and look at all the different types of knives not worth it these knives do n't cut well at all i wish i did n't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives
owned it for about a year the nonstick coating has already started chipping off ever since a couple of months old it sticks sometimes so it 's not exactly nonstick i have never used any hard tools on it but the quality is horrible calphalon no longer the brand name for the quality worst of all i sent it back under the so called life time warranty but i have n't received it for over a month now i am asking myself why i spent so much money for such a piece of junk with no warranty at all ! !
the product description was great and i was looking forward to a cosy and heavenly blanket SMILE to my dismay this product was nothing like that it is ultra thin and like a paper thin foam sheet used in packing material it 's both funny and disappointing the thing is not a blanket at all the sides are cut as if someone did that with a pair of scissors the sides look real this is one of those types of blankets that will not trap your body heat infact since you can see your hand from under the blanket the cheap blanket will give way to any body heat emitted and the heat will easily escape from the blanket the other thing is that this is no twin blanket being single i sleep on a twin bed and its nice and got three heavy duty blankets to keep me all warm in the winter all of them are quality and ultra cosy and heavenly ! so these three blankets are exactly the same size all by different manufacturers which tells me that there is a standard size for twin blankets though this blanket is quite a bit smaller in width than my three blankets it 's so silly to call such useless things blankets save your money and please invest in something that will enhance your sleeping after this bad purchase experience i went to a sears store in close to my home and purchased a nice blanket SMILE and love it
i bought this blanket several years ago and only recently went to use it i figured since it was sitting in a bag i 'd wash it first well what i got was a washer full of lint with what looked like a needlepoint canvas the thing fell apart in the wash ! i called their horrid customer service and the jerk i talked to refused to acknowledge that this could happen he wanted me to send him the lint ! five pounds of lint it took me an afternoon to clean the crap out of my washer ! i 'd strongly suggest that anyone who wants a blanket that lasts steer clear of this blanket that and the absolutely awful and nasty customer disservice '' of this company
i purchased three sets of wamasutta egyptian sateen sheets and thought i had made an investment that would last for years the sheets looked lovely the colors bright with a soft sheen the texture smooth with satin like feel i consider myself a laundry care queen '' always carefully following the manufacturers care instructions within two washes the sateen '' look and feel of the sheets was completely gone washed out the sheets are very dull and very much wrinkled they 're still soft and serviceable but now i also doubt the thread count my supposedly lesser quality sheets are more comfortable and attractive
if i could i 'd rate these as -5 stars i read the reviews and decided to try these for myself during the first wash the sheets shrank a little bit for a snug fit on the mattress what was really disappointing was how small the pillowcases became short by a good 5 inches they never completely covered our standard pillows during the second wash the sheets shrank even more it took us a good 10 minutes to wiggle the fitted sheet onto our mattress do n't even get me started on how small the pillow cases became after the second now as far as pilling it took a couple of months but they have become extremely rough they look extremely ratty and the sheets are only 2 months old my old sheets were nicer but no longer fit on the new thicker mattress i will never buy wamsutta sheets again do n't waste your money we are extremely disappointed customers
we have one of these actually two and they consistently give inconsistent ratings we could n't figure out what temp our aquarium was really at since when the heater kicked on was unrelated to what the thermometer said and as we moved one around the aquarium it would vary by as much as 10 degrees and so when we got one for our second tank and found it had inconsistent results too we put the two thermometers next to each other just inch apart and they 're typically about 8 degrees different i have no idea which if either is accurate or whether they both fade into and out of accuracy
i bought this teapot from amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times the material is great heat retention is good it looks very nice and i had no problems cleaning it i use a babybottle brush the tea infuser is not very effective though the holes are a bit on the large side so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through and the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves especially when i 'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim it does n't extend deep enough so i do n't use it at all i put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as i pour however my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour so you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours ending up with a wet spot on your i have to make sure i either wipe the spout in between pours or set it on a napkin unless i 'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session i found that pretty annoying so in conclusion for the price i paid for this teapot 's supposedly wonderful features i do n't think it was a good buy
cheap and splashes water all over the place noisy to
if what you 're looking for is lush plush truly thick towels these are not it if you want pottery barn luxe you 'll have to go there these are a poor substitute i could not have been more disappointed i returned them all
these sheets are horrible my son is 7 and refuses to sleep on them they are stiff thin and tore from stretching them over the corners of the mattress
i bought these sheets for my who is a huge star wars fan thanks to his brother ! they are probably the sheets i have ever come across scratchy stiff sheer they really are for looks only i am going to take the suggestion of the reviewer below and put extra sheets underneath to see if that makes them even slightly more comfortable if i had known what poor quality these were i definitely would not have bought them
these sheets are strictly for apprearances i bought them for my almost 5 year old son who loves star wars he was very excited about them but they were stiff and felt like a nylon curtain as cute as they appear i would not recommend buying them to sleep on after several washings they softened up only a little i have to put another sheet under them and another pillow case under the pillow case in an attempt to make them bearable
this timer worked for approximately two weeks we noticed it had failed because the appliance did not go on as programmed after many attempts to reset it we decided to return it and report is as damaged so that it had to be removed from the merchant 's inventory
would not work right out of the blister pack plugged it in set the time set the alarm could never get the timer to turn
i have to agree with other reviews on here this is a piece of junk i just bought this timer took it out of the package and it did not work !
firs of all i rarely write negative reviews but this deserves it i bought one of these and within a week it stopped working while it was working it was fine but one day it just stopped working all together and the lcd went blank i returned it and got a new one and the new one stopped working within 2 days same result there no reason for the malfunction as it was being used to control a 25 watt light the non lcd one by timex worked for a month and stopped working properly the time was always off even when adjusted try to find a different brand time
the timex electronic timer is a convenient gadget for controlling lights and appliances with basic functions such as current time and a single event timer the timex electronic timer can easily control one or more electrical devices unfortunately this particular timer is lacking in a few areas which would otherwise make it simpler and more powerful for example it would be helpful to have a set of colored leds indicating the timer 's event status and override status being a wall timer which effectively locates the user interface very close to an electrical outlet it can be difficult to reach table '' electronic timers are much easier to place as the interface is located several feet from the in power and out control receptacles via an electrical cord with one extra conductor with the recent focus in energy conservation consumers are often using electronic timers to reduce their electrical usage in my case i use my timer as a third alarm clock connected to a very powerful light box sunray by sunbox it is set to fill up my bedroom with light five minutes before my alarm clock s are set to go off additionally it engages a powerful speaker system connected to a digital audio source in this arrangement the timer serves as a wakeup tool while the design appears solid and robust i have not been happy with its longevity about a year after purchasing the timer it stopped working there is no physical damage moreover opening the unit revealed no fuse nor obviously damaged components this is n't a problem however as i have decided to upgrade to a table electronic timer for easier access pros simple compact sleek design cons ambiguous status especially from more than 18 inches away only one event lack of durability possibly inaccessible lack of clear status indication
i bought five of these units about six months ago and used each as a timer to prevent my cordless phones from overcharging i have five panasonic cordless phones stationed throughout the house and they really only need to charge about 3 hours per day rather than 24 hours per day six months later not one not one of them is still working they all died within a few months of use this is junk do n't buy it
i was disappointed in this product the butter slid out of the bell and into the water i think it would be better if the inside of the bell was n't glazed
i recieved one of these for christmas i would love to tell you how it works it is missing a plastic piece now to be fair i lost it in the confusion of christmas it must have gotten tossed i called rival to purchase a replacement piece what a joke i emailed response i called they do n't know what i am talking about even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual or if i get a rep who does know what the piece is they say they do n't have one to sell but if i want to pay to ship the unit back and forth they will replace it i have left voice mail messages for supervisors so instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece i will return this to the store as defective and get the money back they lose a sale the store loses a sale they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit do not buy rival products we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor illogical treatment
i was so excited to take the shark sweeper home it worked great until i needed to charge it the motor never started again i could not return it because i threw away the box what a waste of 40
we purchased this thing thinking it would be great for light cleaning it worked marvously for about a month this is when it started making a terrible noise i suspected there was a belt slipping i carefully took the unit apart and quickly discovered the belt was indeed slipping it was easy to get to and i figured it would be a simple replacment part order away from fixing this unit the was the only one that did n't provide a replacement belt part number i called the company they told me it was irreplaceable only after 15 minutes of enduring a customer account setup process irreplaceable i am holding the belt in my hand reading part numbers to them it 's hardly irreplaceable at this point i gave up with and decided to contact the belt manufacturer directly the belt is labeled as a gates after scourning the gates site for quite awhile i give in and email them my inquiry i still have n't heard back from them but i suspect if they are even willing to deal with a end user they 're going to want me to buy 1000 of them or something we 're now looking into a replacement sweeper but not a buyer beware we were also told this was n't covered in the warranty but we could send it to them at a cost approximately 80 of the original purchase price no thanks
i purchased this little sweeper to sweep up bird seed and crumbs on the floor from the kids for the bird seed it 's ok as long as you make a couple passes for food and feathers it seems to pick up about half also i 've only had this sweeper 6 months and the battery slowly died and i always fully discharged and then charged the battery i would suggest getting anopther sweeper that has suction and not just a revolving brush
no suction and only ran about 2 minutes after an all night charge i returned it as defective which it was a waste of money i recommend the excellent dirt devil 083414 extreme power stick vacuum also sold by amazon
only heats the outer edge of the pan and not the center and this burns and dry 's out the edges also the non stick flakes off after a half dozen uses yum ! ! yum ! ! ! eat those little flakes and scrub a bit harder to clean it ! ! ! not to mention the burnt area 's ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i cook a lot of thing such as meatballs in speghetti sauce and vegetable soup for 12 hours sorry about my
very thin and unsteady could n't open it without having to hold the back of it it wobbled side to side as i was forcing it to open i sent it back as soon as i got it
not much to say about this item it sucks very thin and cheap made does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah this is the worst product i have every got from amazon
i was really disappointed when this item arrived it is cute and well made but barely holds a pound of pasta this is more suited for single servings or wall decor but i wanted a large heavy duty colander oh well
i do n't understand this product the picture and description clearly shows a bottle with a sprout pourer yet i only received the bottle without the sprout ! careful how you go about ordering this
does n't work too well watch out for factory stuff
5 stars for the looks and 0 stars for the noise that these sheets make i could n't sleep first week and considered to ship it back but i 've already ordered a matching bath curtains from balard designs so i will keep it
after hours of attemps to assemble this we 've given up we 're taking it back and finding something else poor quality
the chair step stool parts do not match therefore it is not possible to assemble it i called the customer service department number on the instructions i explained the problems and was told that they would send me a form to request a substitute item i was told i would have to return certain parts of the order to ensure that the first item could not be used it has been almost two full weeks and i have received no form and no phone call
i like the style since it 's different from the typical shoe rack but shoes are always falling off this thing it does n't fit boots or many types of dress shoes and it 's hard to squeeze men 's size shoes onto the different tiers without knocking shoes off a different tier
i ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel 's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button snap zipper catch or anything else that could possibly have snagged it it was not nearly as soft as i expected for the price either it was better than what you 'd expect from your standard hotel towel but it was n't any softer than my towels from the jc penny collection the redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet
after shopping carefully online and off i bought this item at jc penney on march 25 2006. penney 's stated regular price is 69.99 with a sale price of 49.99 the same price amazon is currently charging it replaces a old black decker primarily because i read several reviews suggesting a dramatic drop in the quality of b d small kitchen appliances and that hamilton beach was performing well i also have several other hamilton beach small appliances and all of them function well at what they are designed to do this seemed my best choice for a reasonably priced toaster oven since i am not looking for a cheap convection oven just an acceptable toaster large enough for baking a potato now and then or some other small item too large or the wrong shape for a toaster in shopping i found no current toaster ovens with a lever to press for toasting all now have some variation of twist dial for this purpose it is so far performing acceptably as an oven though the top gets very hot however only the first few uses produced acceptable toast on even the darkest toast setting toast set at dark got lighter and lighter and now only three weeks after purchase it no longer toasts at all it does not darken beyond the palest coloring and toasting a second time leaves the bread only drier not at all darker the top elements do not seem to heat properly and do not reach the red color needed to toast bread or presumably to broil anything though i have n't and wo n't use it as a broiler as hot as the top gets from regular oven use i am not confident it would be safe as a broiler even if the upper heating elements were working at three weeks i have no toasting capability at all i fully expect the rest of the oven to cease functioning soon and regardless it is of no practical use to me as a toaster which is the small appliance i want and need i am returning it to the store and starting the search for a toaster oven over again from scratch
i was looking forward to giving this to a friend for chrismtas but when it was delivered to my house the sound of broken ceramic rolling around inside prevented me from even opening it very disappointing
i ordered two of them one was broken the other developed a hairline crack as soon as i put water in it i 'll order another butter bell but i guess this is a case of you get what you pay for inexpensive and cheaply made i 'll keep that in mind when i order other norpro products
oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low i washed them once and they already shrank what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton after i dry with them i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric
1. at least it arrived 2. it did n't cost too much 3. i haven't used it so can only give it one star i am concerned that it apparently does not have a variable rheostat adjustable heat switch going from but maybe it does as i have n't used it yet
the rival slicer model is a generally well designed unit i say generally because there appears in my unqualified opinion to be one major design manufacturing flaw associated with the product the first unit i received had a broken speed control knob that prevented any speed adjustment this unit was exchanged thank you amazon for making that process painlessly easy for another this second unit also had a broken speed control knob the failure point being identical to the first the stem on the speed control knob is either woefully under designed or it is being forced into the wrong position it has a detent during assembly this is really too bad since the unit looks like it would do the job for which it is intended quite well what 's good about this product construction parts i expected to be plastic are made from cast aluminum thick stainless steel blade removable for cleaning angled slicing surface tray to catch the slices of what ever cuts up to '' slices integrated cutting board what 's not so good about this product there are rubber suction cups on the four bottom corners to protect the surface the unit is sitting on and hold it in place while it 's being used this would be a great feature except that the suction cups stick to the surface and pull out of the unit when it is lifted up the speed control knob as stated above and sole reason for number 1 rating
i have an order stuck in limbo that amazon claims they can not remove from their system i ordered two roomba products together back in according to amazon one of the products is from another supplier and that supplier still does not have the product in stock anyway the result is that i get email from amazon every week that the shipment has been delayed but the email and repeated phone calls to amazon indicate there is no way to get this order stopped so the emails keep rolling in to amazon 's credit my second phone call did result in a creation of a new order and the shipment of the one product in this order they did have in stock but the old order with both products is still stuck in their system this is by far the worst experience i have ever had with amazon
the makers of this useless product should be ashamed of themselves it does absolutely nothing to odors
this was a great toy i would drive it around the fish tank pretty easy to control and lasted minutes on a charge unfortunately something happened with my charging base after about uses few months and it stopped working not sure what happened
mr dances to blue this is a bad product whatever other only one agrees say about it being a good one not think of getting a diff kettle simple as tha
we bought this trash can which seems to have a very sturdy design and appears to be well made about 3 months ago we noticed after only a short while that the lid opener '' would not open the can as far as it had before after a couple of days the plastic peice on the bottom broke this can was used mainly by my husband and myself and was not put through any rough handling i have yet to find a replacement part and i did not save my receipt or any purchase information because it is a trashcan that is supposed to be the best that money can buy the metal does not stain or pit it is very solid albeit the opening mechanisim if i find replacement parts i will write another review with that information
unfortunately i should have paid attention to previous reviews when i placed my order for plum fiesta ware of the 11 items i ordered 5 were defective most had serious scratches and the salt shaker was missing the bottom plug this indicates a serious lack of quality control why would those people responsible for filling an order choose defective merchandise to ship out i placed this order as a wedding gift to make matters worse
buyer beware i 'm a kitchenaid fan but these tools while sturdy and elegant are much too large for normal kitchen pots and pans the slotted turner dwarfs a 6 or 8 inch frying pan likewise the slotted spoon is unusable in less than a four quart saucepan
this coffee machine brews the weakest coffee i 've ever does n't grind the beans well and to clean it makes you wa n't to store it in the garbage can that 's what i did i 'm going back to the melitta machine toda
you really ca n't drink coffee from the mugs which come with this coffeemaker unless the lids are off the mug a definite design defect which defeats the purpose of a travel mug it is a very simple oversight there is no vent '' hole in the mug 's lid so that coffee barely dribbles out of the sipping hole even when the mug is full and even if you tilt the mug as high as if you were drinking the last drops from the bottom of the mug it is a very frustrating experience please also consider that the two cups may not fill up evenly as the coffee brews one may slightly overflow while the other mug is not full then there is the instruction book the english is fine but does it really make sense to instruct the user to heat up the mugs first with hot water and then to instruct the user to measure cold water into the same mug to fill the reservoir of course the user can figure his way around that but the only way to use these mugs would be to drill an extra pinhole in each mug 's lid for venting or just use the mug around the house without the lid the mug is comfortable to hold but the thermal value is not too good even when preheated with boiling water i regret having made this purchase
this vacuum cleaner had to be sent back to the manufacturer the setting that determines which type of floor is to be vacuumed simply did not function as i vacuumed the vibration of the machine caused the knob to drift to other settings it was impossible to properly vacuum a bare floor since the knob drifted to the carpet settings hopefully this is a problem with this particular item and not a design flaw the manufacturer plans to test the machine and determine if i am entitled to another vacuum cleaner
read all reviews and believed them what a mistake i have eaten shave ice from hawaii and los angeles and this machine does not make japanese or hawaiian shave ice or shaved ice anyone know what powdery snow feels like and that is what this machine and many reviewers promised but the machine is a big disappointment more like crunchy ice which is supercold since the ice mound becomes more dense and watery almost immediately brain freeze even the title of the item is misleading since the box for the crunchy slush maker clearly states it is a snow shredder ! ! ! kinda sad that this machine does n't make ice better than the manual one i already have i used store bought smaller ice cubes but that made no difference still crunchy and melted fast do not buy this if you want real shave ice or real shaved ice
like others here i bought the 5 piece set on the gold box deal what junk these are made in china knives that can be had for a dime a dozen at any discount retailer
amazon really needs to put a little quality control into what they sell like one of the other reviewers i bought bodum knives with a gold box sale and when they came they were so dull i had trouble cutting and onion definitely returning do n't buy these they 're worthless
i bought it for 59.00 on the gold box deal and it arrived yesterday i returned the product very poor quality poor finish dull right out of the box stay away from this on
i think claims like these would have gotten the two countries into war in the old old days finest japanese blade steel '' on all the knives but on the box there is a clear plastic label that says hold your breath made in china '' i think amazon should make it clear just where these are from i think they are good knives and i bought the five piece set for 60 on the gold box deal no doubt they are worth that much but more i do n't
after reading reviews on the less expensive hamilton beach drink mixer i decided to step up to the more powerful version very disappointing cup is way too small to make a decent milkshake and it does n't crush frozen fruit cubes for smoothies it 's definitely going back
there are only two mixers on the shaft as a result it is very difficult to mix the ice cream into a thick milk shake
we have owned one of these for 18 months it has never done a great job of blending our fruit smoothies but my wife wanted it to match the other ka appliances yesterday it failed while trying to chop up some frozen strawberriies oj i removed the jar saw that the teeth on the drive coupling had broken off take a good look at the drive coupling its made of a hard rubber this is going to be a failure point if you buy this blender i would recommend loooking at another brand
after a week of use the knobs on the blade drive coupling off a look at those knobs revealed that they are made of plastic ! no wonder they broke the blender looks sturdy and solid yet such an important part that makes it operate is made of some cheap plastic ! as far as i am concerned this blender is a piece of garbage why bother to have it repaired if it 's bound to break again !
third time i used it the rubber knobs on the blade drive coupling broke off
the package arrived 12 days after placing the order and the tamper was tossed loose in the box without any packaging there is no way to track the package in fairness to the company the tamper is of high quality and was not damaged in transit overall while i am very pleased with my purchase i tend to expect more from an on line merchant than what was delivered
i washed this quilt on a very delicate cycle brand new so that i could use it and when i took it out of the washing machine it looked like it went through a paper shredder i am very disappointed this was a gift and i am not sure what i am going to tell the person who bought it for us now
too bad that i did n't read the review of this product before i bought the size is smaller than described and it 's not handmade will not buy anything from greenland again
i ordered two of these in king very disappointed very poor quality item cotton is very hard seams coming apart every where loose threading returned asap the abigail quilt i purchased from amazon was excellent
if you 're into coffee cups then this is a if not it 's close to useless as it is for me
i orderded this item and was sent a smaller version which holds approximately 1 cups max i purchased it as a gift and failed to check it was the correct item until had elapsed i now am finding no method to even contact a live person to request a partial refund or exchange
this product does not perform the functions for which it was designed do not buy this product i wish i had returned it with in the first week of having it a real piece of junk ! ! ! cd
i was really excited when i received this for christmas and was looking forward to using this however i was very unhappy when i took out of the box and found the feed tube to be very small and only two slicing disk that suck ! first task shredding cheese well most of the cheese was going around the top of the shredding disk and that was not using the fine shred disk either ! next thing i tried green peppers after chopping the peppers to fit them in the feed tube i got very disappointing results green pepper mush ! mmm the only thing i like about this thing is the cleanup that is it ! i use my giant food processor more than this this is not worth 40 it should be 9.99 and i still do n't know if it would be worth it
this is a revision of the salad shooter '' leave this one on the shelf guys and gals and go out and buy a real food processor it does n't handle the medium not to mention the tough jobs and it is a real pain literally for anyone with an arthritic hand mine went to the salvation army after just one use maybe there it will be worth ten cents to someone who needs a sturdy cardboard box
nicw soft sheets but will wash away after not too many washings one of the pillow cases is already coming unthreaded after just two washes
this is an order i have been waiting to get since i order it on i ordered other items with this i have received them all except this order of pike flannel full sheet set forest green i have been that they make take as long as the end of march or the of april they are already paid for and i would like to know if they are being sent soon i'am an employee at the chambersburg i know we like to make are cumtomers 1. lisa barnhar
i made a poor decision based on a few good reviews when i decided to purchase these i should have listened to the multiple bad reviews lint lint ! i made the mistake of washing my green blue and maroon sheet sets together mistake ! the colors bled all over each other in the then to make matters the colored lint totally overtook my dryer it was a mess but i was determined to get at least one wear out of this useless mess and so i placed them on my son 's bed as well as my own the pilling never stops ! just like others reported the lint was all in our hair on our clothes and some even flaked all over the floor on the positive note i purchased the pink set as well it was not as bad as the darker colors as far as not bleeding and having lint everywhere so i was able to enjoy the softness and warmth these sets offer so trying again i decided to wash each of the darker colored sheet sets separately i still got the same results so i tossed them they are not even good for scraps because of the constant pilling what a waste ! please believe if you want softness and warmth that badly you are better off cuddling with a pet who sheds it 's coat in the spring at least it would be less messy
the sheets have huge lint balls which get on your floor your clothes your hair your comforter your blanket i do n't recommend these sheets
the wok is atually made of carbon iron but not cast iron the name of the item is misleading i regret purchasing it
beware ! this collar does not break away and is not safe this morning my kitty became entangled in part of my son 's toy tent the collar did not loosen or breakaway and the cat was unable to breathe until my husband cut the collar and freed her very scary had we not been home she would not have made it i recommend you find a true breakaway collar to purchase not this one
i bought this set of four stoppers for use with my metrokane rabbit vacuum pump because i was not getting good results with the two that came with the pump with the 4 stoppers from this set i was able to form a seal and create a vacuum however the vacuum lasts only a few hours no matter what bottle it was being used on i do not recommend this product
i had high expectation on this product since i was very satisfied with previous revere purchase but this time i was completely disappointed the saucepans and stockpot have extremely thin walls as a result they are to be handled with care otherwise they will be out of shape easily
the 8 and 10 inch frying pans are not 8 and 10 inches they are in fact 7 and 9 will not be mislead again by this company ! ! ! !
beware of this ironing board it is nothing special kind of rickety and the shipping charges are almost as much as the board which i missed becuase i was ordering a lot of things at once and i was shocked when i got the bill but i guess it 's too bulky to return easily so i just lose but you are
no where in the description did it say the core was aluminum i was under the impression it was all stainless steel would n't have bought it if i had been aware of that
this product cleans no better than a cup of soapy water and a toothbrush in addition the order was shipped in duplicate
this thing does nothing ! aside from the fact that after using it instructions are to polish it with a soft cloth even then the jewelry was not clean so it put it in my old jar of jewelry cleaner used the little brush dried it and went on my way took much less time and did a much better job they should n't even sell this product ! ! ! ! and i had to spend 10 to send it back do yourself a favor and skip this one
i have gone through two of these in the past year different brands but look exactly the same eventually the cleaner self destructs the vibration cracks the plastic first the plastic hinge on the cover cracks then the plastic rim around the top of the stainless steel tank cracks and crumbles and eventually the outer plastic shell of the machine starts cracking it cleans extremely well i use it to for cleaning the dirt and grime out of antique watch movements works like a charm ! if you use fairly frequently expect to replace it about once every 6 months i 've learned my lesson although they 're not the prettiest i 'm going to invest in an ultrasonic cleaner that has a metal shell and cover
i received this jewelry cleaner and maybe i had to high expectations it just does n't clean well i tried my wedding ring a watch a diamond bracelet and diamond necklace i do a better job toothbrush and soap so i 'm returning it
i purchased this item because it claims to have effective means to prevent the food from getting wet and from clogging sadly both clogging and wetness occurred no user error here and this is n't my first feeder i returned to find the food wet and breeding some sort of weevily gnat insect resulting in problems in my tank to be fair this did occur in the humid month of august in new york and the strain proved beyond the model 's capabilities still i was absent for only 3 day maybe splashback from the fish was a problem probably fine with feeding in nonhumid climates but why not just get a cheap basic model for that
i do n't understand how anyone cooks with this it blows out an immense amount of gooey steam water ! i cooked brown rice followed directions exactly even soaking for an hour first it was only 's of the capacity but it blew junk out the sides of the lid and out of the little blowhole and left a large puddle of gooey rice water around and under itself a major mess i have n't even tasted the rice so what if it 's good you ca n't cook with an appliance like this unless you put it in a giant sink or outdoors somewhere what in the world is the deal i do n't even know if i can clean it up enough to return it
i find that this unit spatters and sputters terribly when i make quantities of rice measuring 3 cups dry or more it is a 10 cup cooked unit and i ca n't imagine making any larger quantities than i have i use the right amount of rice and water water spills over onto my countertop and through the air hole as it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop what a mess ! i threw away the packing materials or i would probably return it i do like the pot and the keep warm feature if anyone has any advice on how to keep this mess from happening i would appreciate it
these are not at all what i was expecting to me these are tiny bowls they measure 5 inches across top
it 's a nice idea but they are cheaply made and do n't last very long in the space of 2 years brewstation number 3 has just quit working doing what the other reviewer blinking on and off and you have to unplug it to reset it the first one was purchased new and lasted 13 month after the extended warranty i bought i figured it was just a fluke and liked the design so went out and bought another new one it lasted about 7 months before it checked out into that big coffeemaker station in the sky i wrote hamilton beach and was happy that they responded and they had me cut off the plug and send it to them and they sent me number 3. that was about 7 months ago and now this one has percolated it 's last so instead of constantly replacing 10.00 broken decanters i 'm spending 50.00 to replace brewstations great idea hamilton beach cheap product i would pass
gnocchi is a type of italian potato dumpling and are rather time consuming to make i was hoping this machine would help with the shaping of the dough before boiling as it 's called the millegnocchi attachment unfortunately this machine is not to be used with gnocchi dough the light fluffy potato dough will stick to all the mechanical workings if you use a standard pasta dough instead the attachment will make nicely shaped pasta
this machine definetely deserves a star is for its '' look however i am unable to judge further simply because my specimen broke down after the first crank an inspection of its mechanical construction showed that it had not been designed for actual use but rather for kitchen
i recieved 2 bottles that were not even half full i did try and clean the bottom of a skillet and i did n't see any difference
a bottle of worked so much better and faster just use sponges for general cleaning and when the copper gets dingy a damp cloth of worked in about 10 seconds this cleaner kept my elbows greasy for at least 20 minutes a pot it does work but be prepared to scrub at about twice as much as regular copper cleaner works
2 of the 3 wheels broke off after first trip to laundromat metal coil already ripping through the red polyster hamper tote strap very uncomfortable to carry a bag this large when full of clothe
i see this model is no longer listed by amazon so i do n't know how you got here first it was sold by j r not for the advertised price of 59.21 but for 69.99 ! ! however shipping and handling was half of what dbroth wanted second there is no light on the timer unreadable even with normal ambient light third the start and stop buttons are hard to find used the old standby fingernail polish to highlight them fourth and most serious the power setting does n't work i have no idea what the power setting is set at buy a microwave or similar putchase locally that way you can take it back and complain like hell as for me i will keep it because of the high cost of shipping it back but not buy similar products from amazon unless shipped directly from amazon and with free shipping
i received the white '' pillow a few days ago it is completely discolored mostly beige it appears to have been sitting on a shelf for many years it is only white in the area that the packaging covered it did however adhere well to my whirlpool tub after a serious sanitization process hot water soap and bleach i should have spent a few more dollars for the better product
i was lured by the idea of not having to buy lint roller refills ever again but it seems that this lint remover is actually very it does pretty well with lint and pet hair on the couch and other solid objects but taking the cat hair off of my sweaters and jackets it another story it just does n't quite get the job done if your main concern is upholstery or some other item this is a fairly good product for that but traditional sticky lint rollers may give you more bang for your buck
cheap quality production ! ! ! this was a holiday gift for my wife when she opened the package both trays had large chips of enamel missing along the metal edges it looked like neither tray had been inspected before being put inside the box then the fun '' began as i tried to get a replacement for the damaged items from amazon i checked the box on amazon 's site asking to have the set replaced as i was requested to do and waited for the to be sent that was promised in the instructions five days later nothing not a word from the company by so i went to a store that ships things paid to have the bake set packed up and then paid for shipping next i went and did a search on google to find amazon 's 800 number as you will discover you can not find it on the amazon site at least i could n't i called sat on the phone for 15 minutes and finally got through after discussing the problem with the representative of amazon i got reimbursed for the cost of the packing and postage to send the set back to the company and another set was sent it arrived five days later there were no problems with these trays bottom line too much time wasted to get the item replaced by amazon amazon please please put your 800 number on your site where people can find it easily also if someone checks a box asking for a replacement please get back to the person by as you promised ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i bought this model over a cuisinart due to positive reviews here and elsewhere problems however began right out of the box the machine uses a complicated safety mechanism of levers housed within the handle of the work bowl and the work bowl cover these levers are not lubricated and sealed so when new i could n't assemble the cover to the bowl or the bowl to the motor due to the stickiness of the plastic after i washed these parts they reluctantly slid together the water acting as a lubricant a few months later the handle of the bowl cracked and was replaced under warranty now a month after the 1 year warranty the cover is cracked and must be replaced as well at a cost of 30 these cracks are due to the design and operation of the safety mechanism so i am sure these parts will continue to break costing me 60 a year this is unacceptable especially since i only use the machine every two weeks or so
we have used a cuisinart for about 25 years ! it is getting worn out and parts are not available to make it like new the kitchenaid looks great and has plenty of power but and that is a big but it does not work to do what we want first the amount of fluid that it can hold is pathetic compared to the old cuisinart the kitchenaid leaked like a sieve via the gap between the lid and the bowl the complicated safety '' system that allows something to be placed in the feeder tube but not fingers also prevents us slicing a cucumber or even a reasonable sized potato ! i wonder who designs these obviously who cooks ! when our cuisinart finally gives up my wife says she will go back to a knife we tried this product and returned it for a full refund thanks to amazon
it 's absolutely awful ! it burns everything you put in it the lid does n't come close to sealing and it rattles and allows steam to escape resulting in sauces drying out instead of juicing up '' as they should i literally had chicken turn to charcoal when i left it on for 5 hours on low i would not give this product a zero i would not want this thing even for free ! do n't buy ! you will be disappointed
i like many others have had major issues with this crock pot burning everything i make i lent it to my sister in law for christmas ahe has another brand pot at home and hers did not burn at all or boil mine had the same food in it and was boiling and burned the dish even on low it boils and burns i will be contacting rival now that iknow that i am not the only one i would not recommend this brand or
all these reviews are right on the money ! ! it gets toooo hot ! ! i bought this to replace my old rival that is the same size because i liked the idea of the timer and setting i have used it 3 times and it has over cooked all three meals ! i put a beef stew in it today on low at and by noon the potatoes were mushy and falling apart and it was boiling i hate to think what it would have been like if i let it cook for the recommended 8 10 hours ! good thing i was home today ! i had also bought my daughter one for christmas because of her busy schedule sometimes she does not get home in time to turn her off and thought the keep warm setting would be great for her but i just called her and she told me she tried cooking a roast in it this week and it come out burnt and she only cooked it on low for six hours ! ! i rated this one star because the website would not let me rate it zero
we received two sets of these for wedding gifts two years later and we have one glass left they break just when you 're washing the dishes if you want dishes that last choose something else not recommended
i recieved these for a shower gift on a saturday by monday 1 had already broke and i mean shatered in the sink i did n't drop it or anything but they are very nice looking just do n't expect them to last
i received a set of this glassware as a christmas gift last year of the 12 pieces we only have one of the large glasses and 4 tumblers left these glasses break very easily especially the taller glasses i love the way they look but for durability i would n't rate them very highly
this glassware cracks and breaks very easily particularly the tall glasses after owning the set for a little over a year i now have only one tall glass left the most recent glass broke when i dropped an ice cube in it
i received 2 sets of these glasses for a shower gift in april of the 12 larger glasses that i started with i only have 5 left they look great but break very easily we do n't use the smaller ones that often but we have managed to break 2 of those also
i was shocked how cheap this set was but now i know why the first set i got 4 of the glasses were already broken so i was sent a replacement set the truth is they are just thin and easily breakable i guess you get what you pay for
this was the second pet blinker i bought as the first one rusted out but i loved the product because when it worked it was amazing ! very bright and noticeable which is exactly what i wanted since i go running with my dog at night unfortunately this product is not durable i left the first one on my dog 's collar at all times and when it rusted out a few months later i thought it was my fault so when i bought the one i was more careful i clipped it on my dog 's collar when we went on a run then carefully stored it in a dry closet it worked exactly one time after which it would not turn on again i thought hoped that it was just the batteries so i replaced them no deal the thing is dead so while the concept for this blinker is great i would not recommend it to anyone unless you are purchasing it as a disposable blinker
i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles this is a disappointment ! save your money and search for a better kettle this one is n't a good buy or a good produc
although a pretty kettle and with a wide enough base to support a full flame on commercial range such as viking or wolf the inside became pitted and rusted within months when i inquired from lecreuset they explained that it was not an isolated incident but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months stay away from this on
i am a major fan of le creuset '' pots and have a number of them but i must say that their kettle is not up to par like the other lady said it does spit out water substantially at that when it boils on the stove i am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since i have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and i have been boiling contaminated '' water since a while i just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water wonder what kind of chemicals i have been putting in my body
just want to warn everyone that it chips pretty easily i took it off the shelf and the lid which was not securely in place fell to the floor about a chip resulted on the edge it wo n't affect the function of the kettle but i was disappointed to see the beautiful enamel chip off so easily handle yours with care
i adore le creuset but this tea kettle was a monumental disappointment as other reviewers have noted it rusted within months of purchasing it however i admittedly had no problems with burns from the handle or removing the whistle to pour i ca n't imagine what a person would need to do in order to prevent the rusting aside from never actually using the kettle i was seriously let down by this purchase since it looked so beautiful but ended up being so useless
got this tea kettle for a gift recently it 's discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for 24 99. pros asthetically pleasing looks pretty removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash removable whistle i ca n't stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle so i remove the plug '' cons it 'd be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up plug '' on the spout instead of the removable one i 'll lose it eventually the other le creuset models have the flip up plug '' that opens with a press of the thumb the poor design of the spout is dangerous no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water even with the small amount i use only 4 or 6 ounces at a time a few tablespoons of water blub '' out very quickly sorry i ca n't think of a better descriptive word the spout opening is way too small but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water so the first few tablespoons gush out so when you pour the water do it as slowly as possible put the mug on your counter or another surface that wo n't get ruined when wet and do n't hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the blub '' of boiling water will burn
it may look cute but this is an awful hunk of junk it is way too small to keep fish in well under a gallon the office furniture '' takes up way too much room and it has sharp edges too it 's hard to clean feels very cheaply made and it just is n't good for any kind of fish you 'd be better off getting a 10 gallon tank from you local fish store for not much more money and your fish will be much happier and live longer an awful novelty product avoid this at all costs
buy the office fish tank '' only if you want to end up sitting around at work and watching your dead fish float around at the top ! this tank '' does n't even hold a full gallon of water the decorations '' take up an ungodly amount of space in it and have sharp edges which can be harmful to your fish you ca n't just rinse and refill '' an aquarium either you need to treat the water first or you 'll kill your fish even faster but maybe that would be a blessing for it when compared to having to live in those conditions if you 're going to spend dollars on a fish tank just go to and buy their 10 gallon kit ! it 's not much more expensive and your fish will be much happier with you !
six inches by five by seven think of your average shoebox and cut that in half that 's about the size of this tank '' the water quality can go downhill in an alarmingly short time and putting a live animal in such conditions is a death sentence there is no room for a filter and the decorations are crowding the instructions '' posted in the description are damning to fish as well ideal for goldfish and bettas '' no goldfish require at least 10 gallon tanks for the very smallest ones and larger as they grow in order to be healthy and bettas this tank 's decorations are riddled with sharp corners points and edges perfect for tearing a betta 's long delicate fins and making them susceptible to infection and disease the tank is super easy to maintain just rinse and refill under the tap '' what no conditioners or other additives to make the water safe for fish water straight out of the tap contains chlorine and sometimes other chemicals to make it safe for us to drink but which are deadly to fish this is an example of a horrible trend that tells people that fish are decorations rather than living animals that need care and attention keeping an aquarium requires care education and committment just like keeping any other pet do not buy this product
this item was falling apart before i even pulled it out of the box it was cheaply put together with nails which were loose and could 've easily cut someone your vendor should have the product back by now and i 'm expecting a full refund credited to my amazon account
i received it but with great great disappointment the bowl was not crafted from fine bone china but from fine china the apperance was not as white as bone china and on the bottom of the bowl you may find it said fine chinma '' by the way it is made in indonesia
i hated this item it did not protect my hands from the heat and got too dirt
this product works ok '' if you are simply taking something out of the oven or microwave and setting it down right away i would n't hold on to anything for too long with these you can definately feel the heat through these gloves i highly doubt this could handle heat over 500 as advertised for the price it 's hardly worth it you 'd be better off with a good old fashioned wash cloth
this piece is very small and the spiral to hang the towel on looks cheezy very flimsy when compared to other towel holders i have seen and used my advice is to look for a better one that will fit in with the other italian chef decor available
the microwave was defective fortunately amazon agreed to take it back with full refund i am definitely switching brands on my next purchase
the microwave worked well but who designs a microwave where you have to press the power level button seven times in order to get a power setting of 30 i just wanted to defrost a chicken breast since that was n't one of the foods for defrosting i tried to set the microwave to defrost for a few minutes but who has the patience to punch that power level button all those times to reduce the power level to 30 for defrosting
i thought that i had found the perfect gift for my description provided was not what i got when i received my package there were two problems first the storage box that i received while still very beautiful was not what was pictured nor as big as what was pictured secondly i received no flatware i immediately called and a new set was sent to me same problem wrong box no flatware so i had to send them both back and ca n't even get the item because no one knows why the error kept occurin
i was extremely disappointed that both the sets i purchased were defective there are black speckles brown spots even a green spot in the glaze this is on nearly every single piece i have contacted mikasa by their 800 number and was told they were aware of the problem and would send me good sets but so far nothing has been done this is creamware and it should be creamy white with no dirty looking spots on it i love the pattern the size of the plates everything but the quality they really need to address this problem at the factory and not sell seconds as top quality china
i purchase this itam for a christmas gift for my mother i received it on there is 4 broken pieces i contacted customer service and the kept reading the return policy that the whole set had to be returned the supervisor refused to get on the phone i wrote an email and complained and i told them the reviews indicated amazon worked with other customers to replace the broken pieces i recieved this morning an email stating i had to return the whole set i do n't under the problem since they sell the individual pieces on their wed site the set is pretty but not worth the aggravation
my mother bought me this for xmas used it 3 times worked great then no longer functioned at all called customer service waited on hold for approx 30 minutes to be told there was nothing they could do if i did n't have the receipt my mother is 80 and did n't save the receipt the woman in customer service suggested i just go out and buy a new one i said i think i 'll do that but it wo n't be a toastmaster ! i 'm not impressed at all
this is the worst mop when it comes to having to change the mop head after the second time of having to change it i was so frusterated with the thing that i just went to the dollar store and got a really cheap one and that works better than that thing i even attempted to try and get it off with plyers and that did not even work
i just finished unpacking my oven and plugging it in i am so disappointed by the quality of construction that it 's going right back in the box and back to the merchant the door is not square with the frame and jiggles back and forth on its hinges the pushbuttons are cheap plastic with dimples in the middle from a shoddy molding process and the control panel label is vinyl that does n't fit properly and is already beginning to peel up the stainless steel cabinet is so thin i can see dents in the side where the screws go in i 'm surprised farberware has put their name on such a piece of junk
although the product description seemed promising this product had an electrical problem from the start as soon as i set it up and turned it on i noticed a loud cracking sound coming from the unit about every 10 seconds or so i looked inside the unit and a visible blue spark could be seen it appeared that either the product had a problem with a fuse or a bad connection inside the unit luckily i was home when this what if the spark had caused a fire i returned the product immediately and have since bought another air purifier this one is not worth the money and is a huge safety hazard !
i was extremely disappointed with this toy the directions basically say pull twist and let go '' how hard is that apparently very i thought the toy was broken the company sent me another one and it still did not work ! ! ! ! my dog does n't even pay attention to it do n't waste your money on this item i would recommend something
my pug ginger got this for xmas and the toy is cute but she ca n't get her mouth around the toy 's belly because it has the retractable reel inside it for the squirrel 's tail i do n't have a lot of room inside to really through this guy around but maybe outside it would fly farther because i 'd have room to really fling it i am keeping an eye on her when she does play with it because the string from the tail might tangle up or snap you never know
although the body of the squirrel is still intact our pug tore the fur off the tail of the squirrel the first day he had it he still plays with the body and there is nothing for him to choke on but i was disappointed that it fell apart so quickly
i recently ordered a replacement pitcher i ordered the wrong pitcher i have them twice and have yet to hear from them now i am stuck with a pitcher and now have to find the right one it was my firsttime doing business with them and now my last
the heat from the original machine warped the plastic replacement pitcher during the first use the pitcher is now unusable
i bought one of these and it did n't work when it arrived so i returned it for another one which in turn did not work when it arrived i did n't even bother returning it again since it was too much trouble for the price i just threw it away sorry but i ca n't recommend this product
at first it worked then it worked intermittently not a good thing ! and now it just does n't work at all no matter where i turn the dial always past 30 minutes or it wo n't work it does n't budge look elsewhere
i bought one that did n't always work and a replacement one was even less reliable i upgraded to a higher priced mechanical timer from taylor and it did n't work at all what can have happened to taylor products !
i have the same rice cooker except with induction heating and wanted to purchase this item as a wedding gift well when i get this item i notice the box seems a little less than new i notice that the rice measuring cup is missing the manual is worn and there is the scent of rice in the machine it was a used item note that the item is not sealed but amazon should have known very disappointed especially for an item this expensive
i bought these riedel glasses for the reputation of that brand i was very pleased with the quality however the glasses are too small to truly enjoy any wine i recommend the riedel vivant model from target instead
while the high end riedel glasses are very nice this set did n't even come close to my expectations i thought i was getting a nice set of high quality glasses i could give as a gift what i got was an undersized clunky set of glasses that i could have gotten for 9.99 from target a total disappointment
i have been looking for a '' that will remain flat on my electric flat cooktop after reading all the after page i thought the anolon titanium would do the trick however after one 1 heat up on high to fry some hamburger i had a pan that wobble terribly on its middle point right where anolon stamps its logo one can whirl the pan on this point with ease this product may be great for the gas cooktop but do not get it if you want a flat bottom pan for your electric cooktop the handles stayed cool and had a good grip feel and balance for carrying and cooking
the sliding measuring spoons were very difficult to slide even for someone not having arthritis making this item not very user friendly the big measurer did not easily expunge the food i was measuring and with having to grease the plunger to make it move easily added to prep and time liquids tended to leak i think i am better off with a regular set of measuring cups and spoons
this is a really cool concept poorly executed the clear sleeve slides up and down on an aluminum cylinder the top of the cylinder is a rubber gasket that seals the sleeve thus preventing leakage between the sleeve and the cylinder all of that works fine the problem is that at the bottom of the aluminum cylinder is a plastic ring of a larger diameter than the cylinder this ring stops the sleeve from sliding below the top of the cylinder and also acts as a foot so you can stand the measuring cup unfortunately the ring is made from a fairly hard plastic which can become brittle and crack but it does n't break away cleanly so you 're left with a measuring cup that wo n't stand up straight that might be fine if you 're measuring things and dumping them straight into a bowl but if you have to sit the thing down while it 's full forget it
i 'm astonished at the good reviews this appliance has accrued the primary reason that i bought it it 's possible that mine was a dud but just about everything was wrong with it once you plug the appliance in the red light is supposed to go on mine never did the appliance smoked so heavily that the smoke alarm went off in the apartment the manual warns of slight smoke and odor '' upon first use the smoking never stopped since i had already taken the trouble and prepared a waffle mix i decided to remain undaunted the green light is supposed to go on when the maker is mine did not go on 20 minutes later with smoke billowing all around i decided that the green light was not about to give me the go ahead and i should assume that the appliance had somewhat daunted but still determined with the family now desperate for breakfast i decided to lay on the mixture no lights to tell me when i could expect results no automatic switch so 2 minutes later i opened the lid and peered inside nada nothing still runny i shut the contraption and waited again i lifted the lid on and off several times over a period of 10 minutes finally the waffles looked done so i tried to prise them off sorry ! the waffle maker seemed too fond of its waffles to give them up i took a sharp knife to them and and tried to yank them off i was rewarded with waffle shreds i tried to lift off the waffle pan entirely so i could attack it in a more convenient location instead it attacked me what looks like safety handles on the sides are not safety handles at all ouch ! burns ! yeah if i was n't so dignified i 'd be sueing a particular company bruised hurting and irritated i was still not about to give up i allowed the pans to cool i washed them out i doused them literally with cooking spray i tried again this time it worked the waffles tasted fine except by now it was lunch and i 'd already depleted the mixture in failed attempts it still took about 10 mins to bake 2 waffles i 'm returning the appliance to amazon today i 'd love to pay more and get a really maker but there seems to be nothing in the market the way to go is to buy separate gadgets methinks
it looks fancy in the picture the panel is actually hard to read the steam penetrates through the panel and thus make it blurry and out it has an unstable base bought three opened one returned three
if what you 're looking for is lush plush truly thick towels these are not it if you want pottery barn luxe you 'll have to go there these are a poor substitute i could not have been more disappointed i returned them all
this measuring cup is very difficult to slide and to clean it is much easier to spray a regular measuring cup with cooking spray to help release sticky things such as peanut butter or honey spend your money on a good set of traditional measuring cups
i have to agree with another reviewer i got one of these as a gift and i was really excited about it but it 's a devil to keep clean the inner canister has a textured surface where flour gets easily trapped i only used it once and now it just takes up space in my tool drawer next to my beloved measuring cups great idea really bad execution
i find that it does n't slide easily even when the seal is oiled which you have to do whenever you wash it a bit of a pain i was excited about getting it because alton uses one on his show but i never use it i just use my regular measuring cups and use a rubber spatula to get the sticky ingredients out also it 's hollow on the inside so if you wash it in a dishwasher and you want the soiled part towards the water the hollow part is facing up and gets filled with dirty dish water
this is the most i 've spent on a coffee maker it was delivered right before christmas of and broke 3 months later what a waste of money it made very good coffee while it worked the last time i expected it to function i was greeted with a flood on my counter and floor all 6 cups of water had leaked out the 'on ' button stopped working no doubt it somehow shorted itself out from the water i will never buy this brand again
makes good coffee but if i had it to do over again i 'd just buy a good drip maker and save the money cleaning is the biggest problem i do n't have a problem of coffee dripping down the front but steam coming from the pot during the brewing process causes it to collect and drip down the front of the maker if you do n't remove it when the brewing cycle is complete steam continues to condense and drip the steam also forms on the lid of the brewer when you open the top it runs to the back of the lid and drips down the back of the brewer another contribution to water under the base cleaning the pot is also a pain bottom line i 'd rather have a good drip maker and a good stainless carafe lot cheaper
it looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it
love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish and the butter dish is very pretty however it is too small ! ! or short you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck the lid does not touch the bottom of the dish until you have used most of the butter also it has to reach room temperature so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better which in turn makes a mess really very unusual and it drives me nuts i do not recomend the butter dish sadly
the manufacturer states this cover will work on 11 inch plates it only fits plates 10 inches in diameter otherwise it seems to be made well enough of a hard plastic material if it is seated correctly on a plate it is slightly less than 2 inches tall this may be a little low for some foods
as mentioned by another reviewer this item has a critical flaw it 's just too short it ca n't be used with bowls over a few inches tall and for small plates with a small pile of food the cover is touching the food this is especially troublesome when the cover has been used to prevent splatters dried splattered food on the inside of the cover is happily mingling with the food on your plate other than that it does its job well and prevents splatters but i simply do n't have enough instances where i can use it ideally to be more versatile the cover should be at least twice it 's current height which is why i 'm continuing my search
this teacup has a beautiful design but i was very disappointed when i received it the cup and saucer were much thicker than i would have expected for a china teacup ! it also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer i sent it back as i could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup
i just spent two futile hours trying to remove some garden variety dirt from my stairs i vacuumed and i really ca n't say enough good things about the dyson vacuum it 's awesome ! used the zorb tool that came with my vacuum and thoroughly worked it into the stains waited 30 minutes and vaccumed thoroughly again nothing ! i should have read a book instead for all the good it did very disappointing and now i 'll need to find the energy to get out the carpet cleaner and do it all again
two days ago i used a bag of zorb that had come with my dyson a year or two ago maybe this stuff spoils it left the most foul smell smells like my basement on the lake with the leak that he never used to go in to we poured an entire box of baking soda on the floor in my daughter 's room but you can still smell it throughout the entire house it 's nauseating it even seems like when i went to work this morning the smell had gotten into my clothes and went with me ! i love my dyson but boy this zorb stuff ! ! ! !
it wo n't clean any spots but it will freshen the the smell if any and awaken the nap no pun intended it refreshes and renews with relatively little effort we have 2 dogs and they have had no adverse reactions so in between carpet cleanings this product will give your carpet a
this filter does seem to work well however i am returning it due to the excessive noise that it makes if you look at the other reviews for the you will see the noise described as white noise '' let me explain the noise that it makes a little better than that the unit does make a white noise that is associated with the moving fan blades however underlying this noise is a lower pitched motor noise that is more of a whining sound like a vacuum cleaner this noise is less than the white noise on the low setting about equal to the white noise on medium and overpowers the white noise on high the other quality of the whining noise is that you can hear it from a further distance than the white noise so when you have the unit on high you can hear the whining noise resonating throughout my home through the floorboards and through the walls i think that one of the greatest considerations with an appliance such as this should be noise i can not understand why the honeywell engineers have not done a better job considering this
i bought this item in october 2005 by january it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher i contacted both amazon and emile henry about it amazon will only give a partial refund and emile henry told me to go through the merchant and did not offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product do n't buy this piece of junk
the idea is good but there just does n't seem to be enough suction power unless you want to spend 5 or 6 hours vacuuming your fish tank i have a small 10 gallon tank i keep it very clean i use all the chemicals and additives to keep the water clear and free from odor i change the water every couple of months so it should n't take me forever and a day to vacuum the gravel once a month but it does
i picked this coffeemaker up on the remanufactured '' deal on amazon what i did not know was that remanufacturered '' meant obvious warranty returns jammed into a new box and resold '' the mugs were filthy with dried coffee on them at least i hope it was coffee the mugs were both dented as if a car had run over them yet the shipping box and product box had no damage whatsoever obviously they had been damaged before the remanufacturing '' process i 'm dissapointed in amazon for selling this trash
i am still waiting for my refund or replacement as i returned this item immediately as the problem with the electrical button were a serious safety issue i returned this and have heard nothing from amazon or the manufacturer the power switch would give you a slight shock when touching to turn the item on or off at first i thought it was just me but after checking it several times my husband and i decided '' although very convenient in thought was not worth risking electrical shock or possible fire due to shortage it has been nearly a year since the item was returned and i have had no luck from anyone in regards to a refund or replacement
dear do n't buy this hunk o ' junk i got one over the summer thinking it 'd be really convenient but it does n't work as it 's supposed to hence the reason a cuisinart product has gone way down in price to 15.99 the whole brewing mechanism gets very clogged and even repeated washings with vinegar do n't clean it properly you end up with unevenly distributed cups of coffee one cup with 10 the other with about maybe with grounds floating in them yecch ! try another brand instead or get a more traditional coffeemaker
i purchased this item last may and although at first i was thrilled to have an automatic litter box i soon realized that it was very noisy difficult to clean container holder is flimsy gaps between holder and box mean litter spills out the side underneath to cut down on the mess i purchased the tent to keep the litter inside very bad idea ! tent is flimsy ripped upon assembly makes it extremely difficult to empty box it seemed i was spending as much time maintaining this box as i was a regular litter box i was just about to order replacement cartridges which do n't really snap shut by the way when you go to take them out when i decided to see what else is out there in the world of automatic litterboxes i purchased a purrforma jumbo box and so far it is wonderful it is sturdy has a huge hood that you just lift off is so quiet that it does n't need a sleep timer like the littermaid one it is well thought out and i would urge anyone to spend the extra dollars to get it it 's a small price to pay for your sanity
while this product cleans the litter box well when it works the problem is we 've had two of these stop working in 2 months apparently the motor driving the rake is weak and burns out easily
the littermaid is designed to automatically empty your litter box making it easier for busy cat owners like myself having owned one for about 3 months i have found significant issues with it 1 it always dumps litter between the cracks of the receptacle meaning i have to vacuum the area under the littermaid everyday 2 it gets stuck very often and i have to manually even out the poop 3 it often pushes much of the unused litter into the receptacle i have to replace the litter often 4 with two cats the receptacle has to be replaced every two days because it fills up ! the receptacles are about 2 a piece making this expensive ! 5 littermaid brand litter works the best but it is 14 a bag which lasts about two weeks with two cats bottom line the littermaid is not really an automatic litter box since you are actually performing maintenance on it every other day i have found that it is just as much work as a regular litter box do n't waste your money ! ! i am going to be looking into the scoop free automatic litter box system that has gotten some great reviews
i loved this item for the first few months and then it broke down for whatever reason my problem was with the company i spent about 6 months to a year trying to get a hold of the company for help i tried emails numerous phone calls and snail mail but i never got any response so i gave up and tossed it and pray that someone else who understands what the phone is for will make another version
i bought these sheets in august of 2006 and after just a couple of washes and a few weeks on the bed they pilled they 're soft and the color goes really well with our color scheme but unfortunately they were extremely the 20 dollars spent on them should have gone into a better set of sheets
slept on this bed one night could n't wait to get out of it definitely not recommended only gave it 1 star because zero stars is not an option
product was very over priced for what i got and shipping was entirely too hig
granted i probably should replace my processor because of its age but it works fine i had to replace my bowl recently for mydcl -8 plus and the bowl is very difficult to get on and even more difficult to get off the fit is not the same
i purchased these to keep on my counter and house my coffee i used them daily and they soon looked terrible ! the paint on the lids has worn off almost all the way around the edge and there are chips off the enamel portion as well i do not recommend these for anyone who is actually going to use them
ok for cornbread but not at all for scone
i followed the directions to the letter and cured my new pan as instructed it 's a great idea but it just does n't work the cornbread sticks to pan
poor quality returned product shortly after it arrived it drips all over the place recommend against purchasing this product as you will probably be disappointed
i just recieved my honey dispenser and was very disappointed with the plastic handel and plunger mechanism i had to go back and read the description and sure enough the description said the handel was stainless steel it 's not ! it 's chrome coated plastic unfortunately if i had read the reviews i would of picked up on that
i have to agree with the previous reviews that this dispensses honey way too slowly additionally it is much too difficult to fill without making a mess since you can not have the top open without having the bottom open as well this dispenser is just not worth the trouble and mess no matter how great the idea
my glasses had air bubbles and abnormally shaped blobs of glass where the stems connect to the bowls they were functional but deformed i sent them back in addition molding lines were visible but not so bad
i ordered this set for my father in law for christmas this year although they shipped these glasses quickly they were of the poorest quality i have seen each of the rims of these glasses were uneven and one was even chipped ! there were very noticeable molding marks on each of the stems as well when i tried to contact the wine enthusiast it took forever just to reach a real person and when i did she was very short with me i do not suggest this product whatsoever
i got a set because the photo looked good when they arrived i felt molding ridges in the stem but mostly they had been ground off of the foot and saw wavy distortions in the bowls from uneven glass thickness and shape these aspects bothered me so much i returned the glasses you must decide where you want to be on the quality price spectrum but be aware that these are much worse quality than for instance the hungarian blown glasses from
buyer beware ! this is being advertised here as easily holding a 750 ml bottle of wine yes it will hold one 750 ml bottle but it is actually intended to be used as a 375 ml bottle personal decantor not a 750 ml bottle decantor according to reidel discovered after receiving the product
i would give it zero stars if i could got the product followed the manual to get everything ready plugged it in turn the knob on nothing ! no power no fan sound no light nothing ! that 's about what this product is worth to me right now nothing ! disappointed to put it mildly shame on rival for slapping a quality control sticker on an item that does n't even power up amazon sent me a replacement unit and guess what the replacement unit did n't work either ! i made sure the pieces went together as instructed and that the auger was properly snapped into place but no dice amazon told me they could not ship another replacement because it was and i quote as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought we are not able to send another replacement hence i request you to return the item for a full refund '' and yet it is still for sale here on amazon
not what is represented or i have a bad one i do n't know which should have returned this one but didn't
now i would likely upgrade to 3 stars since one ca n't expect much for it is a large thin plastic bag and i really doubt it will hold up long term but it is much thicker than any plastic bag i 've found to use as a dust cover for christmas and other seasonal items to store in the attic
i loved the idea behind the python and set it up easily enough i think its a total rip off to charge 50 for a piece of plastic tubing with some plastic attached to it the hose adapter that attaches to the faucet broke so easily when i screwed it in it takes alot of water pressure to make this work correctly the replacement piece of plastic cost me 10 bucks more than the already rip off python good concept but made of cheap stuff get a one or make your own ! !
the lowest setting is too dark for my taste when making toast enough said
i bought this thing from amazon over a year ago it never worked right but a least it only caught bread on fire a couple of times we have gone round and round with kitchen aid over getting a replacement they wo n't honour the warranty at the very least amazon should drop it run
not the item i expected to receive seemed more plastic and smaller than i needed i do n't believe it was advertised incorrectely it just was n't the item i was looking for the plastic base they suggested to purchase with the dish drain was way too small i sent back the entire shipment
i purchased this for my daughter and boy is it a cute idea ! ! ! and it even worked okay that is for just over 1 yep just past the limited warranty so i called bissell and they informed me that there are no longer parts available for this model and my only option was to buy a new one well i told them i am not likely to do that since it only lasted a year ! ! ! we did n't even get to use the handle extentions that come with it what a nice addition to the landfills ! !
this is a nice looking comforter however it lacks in the filling the comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have bad they skimped on the filling
this comforter might fit a full size bed but it was way too small for a queen
having bought this knife over a year ago i must say i have had much better for less i have since purchased a carbon steel japanese sashimi knife with a wood handle that is equal to the global save it 's blade requires a quick wash and dry to avoid staining i find the global 's stainless steel blade to require less maintenance however due to its brittle temper the tip broke soon after i purchased it my main critisism is that the continous metal grip is slick and with wet hands as one might have when slicing a large fish there is the distinct possiblity of losing your grip and your hand sliding forward toward the blade in addition the rear cutting edge of the blade adjacent the grip has a sharp edge exposed and given the slippery handle it is not as safe as other designs i would n't mind the high price as long as you get equal value in this case there are better traditional japanese alternatives easily found on the web i suspect i helped pay for celebrity chef endorsements i would not reccomend it to anyone unless a contemporary appearance is more important than functionality it is a good looking with a broken tip !
its not light as advertised its actually a very cumbersome broom i 'd rather use a regular broom than this huge thing i would not recommend for every day use the bristles get bent due to the weight of it and they do n't sweep as well after a month or so
bought for my wife and it is usless short battery life and poor suction a total waste of money
i was wanting something to make cleaning the kitchen floor a bit easier this broom '' needs to be held at a particular angle for it even to suction anything very frustrating must be why it is on sale ! ! ! ! !
ended up giving it to my parents and buying the shark liked the concept of the broom with a vacuum but tends to get just a little heavier as you keep cleaning not such a great job cleaning around the edges of the tiles and does n't pick up as much when on a low angle just not bad that 's all
i bought this as a gift for my sister and her husband when we opened it it looked or seemed like a table cloth it was perfect rectangle slip covers are supose to fit to the couch chair loveseat etc from what i knew it was also way too small ! i understand that every love seeat is different as is every piece of furnniture depending on the maker but this was extreme my fault i guess for assuming and shopping online i do n't even know if i can return it it 's just sad that i was so excited to give this as a gift and then it was a joke
within 10 minutes of the pie crust shields being on the pies the crust was burnt pies came out better without a shield
i bought this great looking toaster back in june of 2006. i first noticed that it toasted darker on one side when not on the bagel setting but i was willing to overlook that problem '' after just a few months of use the lever pops up after a few seconds and i have to push it back down 2 or 3 more times in order for it to toast my bread back to west bend it goes
recieved as a gift from my parents made 2 pots of coffee before the machine broke the down button got stuck seems this has happened to others making the machine unusable i will try the melitta grind and brew without the weather because the buttons are different and hopefully wo n't stick also the reviews for that machine are great and it is about half the price of this one
why why why did n't i listen to the reviews i guess i was excited about the coolness '' of this product i cleaned the maker 2 times as instructed let machine cool over night grinded and brewed my starbuck french roast poured a cup replaced carafe saw message on screen something like nbt short '' defect then went back to weather screen this had turned the warming plate off which will only stay on for 1 hour after brewing i tried to turn warming plate back on which requires the button which wo n't work because it thinks you want to brew more and when there 's no water it tells you that and wo n't turn on so you can not turn the warming plate on after it turns itself off without brewing more coffee ! i did find the coffee was plenty strong enough though i like strong french roast coffee looks plastic looked cheap but stainless steel was overall ok looks i bet i can buy 2 separate pieces for the coffee maker and weather station for less money ! guess i wo n't buy a melitta again ! amazon shipped to me super quick literally next day must have been in the warehouse right down the street however now i guess i have to pay for the shipping both back and forth so much for super saver shipping i should have bought it at target for slightly more i could have returned it for no loss of
i purchased this item because of the good inital reviews however i have just received my replacement coffeemaker and it has the same problem as the first one i received look at the picture of the coffeemaker do you see the metal plate that covers the buttons that plate slides down and makes the buttons stick you are unable to turn the coffeemaker press the timer buttons because of it additionally the original coffeemaker failed to make coffee as programmed about every other time it was set i would steer clear of this item it 's great when you can get it to work but because of the obvious engineering defects see other reviews with the same problem it is more of a hassle than it 's worth especially at the current price i guess all the time and effort into getting a coffeemaker to tell the weather made the designers forget about basic functionality
i bought one of these because i thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee the beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber this works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink the problem i had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it was n't as as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker i ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder if you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you 'll probably end up doing the same
the picture in the item description shows a dark red which would have matched our kitchen colors be aware though that these are close to an orange or a very bright red
this is just the right size for one martini but the cover does n't fit properly you have to really push it down firmly or else it comes right off when shaking but then it is hard to remove
i bought the assuming it would have the capacity to handle more coffee beans ground i like strong coffee but no it takes a typical 4 cone filter and there 's no room for spillover the filter holder is the same size as the filter my previous 30 coffee machine at least has room for filling the filter up to the brim you ca n't do that with this machine moreover this design flaw defeats the manufacturer 's selling proposition that a capacity is suited for entertaining well if you do that those cups of coffee are probably weak
this quesadilla maker makes a very colorful addition to the kitchen counter but that 's about it it does n't allow you to put in enough filling to make it worth the trouble ! you can barely taste the thin filling layer of chicken cheese or whatever mostly you just taste tortilla too bad because it is a great idea it just needs to be redesigned
the problem is n't with the unit taking a long time to chill a bottle of wine the problem is that it does n't chill a bottle of wine i put a bottle of room temperature chablis in and selected chablis from the list of white wines the unit said it would chill it to 46 degrees and indicated that the starting temp was 77. that was my first concern because the bottle was room temperature and room temp was 70. the unit took more than 30 minutes to get the bottle to the desired temp according to the units thermostats but when i opened the bottle the wine was probably a bit warmer than a pinot should be served at i turned the unit off placed the bottle back in using the accompanying sleeve both time btw and this time the starting temp read 61 degrees in other words it disagreed with itself soo i chilled it again for another 20 minutes and upon reaching 46 again the bottle was no cooler than it was before i do n't understand how these are selling they are probably good for bringing room temp reds down to the appropriate serving level but this simply does not chill white rose or sparkling wines to the desired temperature so it 's great i suppose for someone who does n't have a wine refrigerator or a cellar but who wants to drink red wines at the appropriate temperature it 's terrible for anything other than that this is as disappointed as i 've ever been with a product before
the buyer was great but this product did n't help at all the light shined in a circle pattern no light at the middle i returned them and i got notification of a credit to my credit card
not as expected does not give off enough lite to read cook books appears to be strictly decorative
light arrive did not work going on 3 months and stil waiting for either replacement or credit to my accoun
do not buy this light ! provides poor light and begins to fade after a few minutes do n't waste your money like i did
this is another product that had the name brand but not quality first it is not the normal cast iron le creuset products it is made of a thin layer of steel with some enamel like paint on it it does not heat up evenly and food burns and sticks to the bottom second moth of using it the enamel paint start to chip off the bottom i did not use any abrasive cleaning products and always used wood or nylon utensils contacted the manufacturer about warranty and never heard back from them i bought it for 40 when it was on sale definately not worth even that let alone the normal price
the price was great and i was already familiar with the quality of this company 's merchandise having used some of their pots and pans for years since marriage when the stockpot arrived it was just so pretty and i could n't wait to use it the first time was great however this time i was putting together a black bean soup and as i scraped the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon i became aware something had happened a day or so later as i took all the soup out to transfer to a bowl there on the bottom of this pan was all the enamel coming off in big pieces i could n't believe it ! it is ruined and i will never be able to use it again it 's just so pretty and the perfect size so it 's a big disappointment i wo n't buy lecreuset again
i bought this pot and i made sauce in it when i was stirring the sauce i noticed white flecks floating around i emptied the pot and saw a large burnt black hole in bottom of pot i did not burn anything in the pot and the sauce was simmering on low when i really looked at the burnt spot half the enamel is gone and the steel is showing through all this from sauce and 1 use no thanks the pot is being returned
my dog 80 lbs liked this toy when it contained a treat but within a week it was beginning to come apart so i threw it away maybe she needed the black kong
i was completely dismayed with the overall appearance of these dishes the '' looked like a bug and the patina was very blotchy and uneven husband said it looked like someone had wiped something brown and nasty on them very disappointing and expensive to ship back ! do n't use the photo as a guideline it looks nothing like the actual product
these dishes arrived and they were lovely ! i loved the color and the fact that they were all different in markings not a design and the tiny imperfections added character to their antiqued '' appearance which went perfectly in my house which is modeled after the saloon in gunsmoke yeah my husband 's idea ! i took them out of the boxes and even ordered another set when i saw them i washed them before i was going to put them in in the cabinet and i was shocked to see that they had soaked up the water and were water logged showing obvious water lines ! the glazing does not cover the ridge around the bottom but i 've had other dishes that were n't glazed there either and never had this problem before they dried out overnight but my who is very dish savvy told me that if they do that it is sure to weaken the dishes cause premature crazing so i was forced to send them back amazon was great about it and since the product was defective i am not responsible for the return shipping costs these were the perfect dishes i thought i am back to shopping on amazon for more dishes it was n't their fault
these dishes are everything they say they are except the embossed pattern does not in any way shape or form resemble a but rather looks much like a scorpion or bug complete with a body and legs the smaller pattern in between the insects resembles a marijuana leaf so if you want to impress guests with bugs and pot leaves on your serveware this is the set for you
i love the dishes i ordered 3 sets 12 square plates 3 sets 12 round salad plates 1 set footed round bowls 4 2 sets rimmed bowls 8 and 2 sets 8 mugs so far the plates arrived but in 1000 pieces sent them back and they only have 1 set to send me it has n't arrived one set of salad plates was broken but has been replaced the 4 footed bowls arrived fine one set of rimmed bowls was chipped one set of mugs was broken i have n't received the lable to send them back so now i have 12 salad plates 4 mugs 4 footed bowls 4 rimmed bowls no hope of owning a complete set
this filter is not the item pictured flatter top with the orange indicator but the new and awful dome top style that starts filtering slowly to where it takes days to filter a tank after much less use and does n't seem to produce water that tastes as good as the old style pur has discontinued the orange indicator model it looks like amazon does n't sell from a supply of these older and better ones
the pockets are too small for men 's size 10.5 athletic shoes and women 's size 9.5 athletic shoes but sandals and moccasins will fit
received this as a gift it is real classy looking but very small so ok you have just a few friends over for evem then i question functionality the cover is very difficult to replace securely and it is not insulated so how well will it work
the bowls are too small the mugs are too big and the tops are a waste of time save your money
i bought this waffle iron about 6 months ago we make waffles almost every morning after about 2 months i needed to spray pam every time i used it now even with pam i ca n't get an entire waffle out it usually comes out in about 5 or 6 sections i 'm ordering the villaware that alton recommends i 've loved every other tool he 's recommended so i am hoping that this will be the same
i added this as a backup to an older oster that works great and have been very disappointed with this one it takes minutes to make a bad waffle perhaps it is n't working properly not sure
i added this as a third waffle maker we line them up when the kids all come home with their families i added a fourth the waring pro to me the oster is nowhere as good as my 2 old proctor silex wafflers it is called a belgian but the depth is only half of the others and does not cook as evenly or as crisp a result i seldom use it the new waring pro on the other hand is great ! ! ! i suggest looking at it more money but worth it it quickly became my favorite
this cooker makes wonderful rice i do n't find it especially slow slightly slower than cooking on the stove but not much the rice has great texture and flavour the product is not particularly difficult to clean an excellent nonstick pot means you get the rice skin in your food rather than having it stick to the pot but in some circles the skin is a delicacy basically not bad but the electronics are pathetic given how easily sanyo could have done better i 'm harsh in my criticism first there is no audible notice when your rice is done it cooks for a while and then it stops it only counts down the last ten minutes it does not know initially how long the rice will take because presumably more rice takes longer and it has to sense how much rice there is which it does quite well but this means that you ca n't even reliably set a kitchen timer ! not that you should have to there 's quite a sophisticated computer in there and it would add no complexity and little hardware to make it beep ! but no you just have to watch the unit second there is a nice steam '' feature but it is not possible to use that with a timer the manual helpfully advises that you time steaming by hand which is difficult because while the machine knows when the water starts to boil it does n't tell you ! you have to watch or listen for steam at least the slow cook '' feature lets you time things in increments of a half hour think stew third i 'm partial to clocks but i 'm used to clocks this unit has neither it mostly follows conventions but noon is not this is more logical a numbering system that goes from 0 to rather than from 1 to as is the convention but i 've done a few times because is midnight in the world why sanyo thought it a good idea to use of the standard clock formats but rather invent their own is a mystery fourth only for the somewhat the unit does not shut off when you open the lid when your rice is cooked the unit enters keep warm '' mode which is great but even when the lid is opened and the bowl removed the unit stays in that mode until i start to wonder why my kitchen feels warm the keep warm '' light is probably more obvious if you 're not as tall as i am and i suppose some people will serve some rice close the unit eat go back for more rice at least an audible warning that the unit is still on upon lid would be nice fifth the control panel resets to its default white rice '' after each use there 's a battery backup for the clock and i leave mine plugged in anyway so the machine could easily remember the last thing you did i almost always cook brown rice but it does n't sixth of course a holster for the provided spatula would n't be a bad idea but that 's minor in summary it makes very good rice but sanyo cut many stupidly trivial corners
i do n't think they do a very good job because there are always little specks floating in the bowl that do not seem to be filtered out warning if you are buying for the first time be sure to run cold water over the filters before putting them in your cat fountain otherwise your water will become very dirty with charcoal
great sugar dish fantastic colour but amazon 's shipping time of weeks is way off i ordered this twice and had it take well over a month to arrive
i ordered the bench the armchair and the coffee table the armchair arrived damaged and the bench arrived so damaged i could n't use it beware you ca n't return these items to the store i have to ship the bench back in a heavily damaged box at my own expense as usps wo n't take the box it came in
i 'll second bargain savvy mom 's review i do n't want a brush to vacuum large flat smooth surfaces i can use a cloth to wipe dust off those kinds of surfaces i want a brush to dust rough or textured surfaces such as fabrics speaker grills textured walls that sort of thing this simply does n't work for any of those if you look closely at the picture you 'll notice that the bristles on this brush flare out at a pretty wide angle what you ca n't see is that the bristles are very stiff as a result if you are trying to dust anything other than a hard smooth surface the leading bristles constantly grab the surface you 're dusting and you feel like you 're fighting with it all the time softer bristles pointed more straight down would have been a lot better i tried this on a few things but just found it to be useless for what i wanted to do with it your mileage may vary oh and 30 seems way overpriced for this light weight thing made from cheap plastic
throughout the years i have used and owned many different versions of the brita pitcher water dispenser all of these filtered water containers have been great the only complaint i have ever had with these filters is size the brita ultramax water filter dispenser was supposed to answer this problem unfortunately due to bad design it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past brita products pro size this water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water ironically this is really a disadvantage as you will find below con s mold if you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days you will get mold this mold will probably make you ill sore throat conversely if you look at it from another point of view it will strengthen your immune system to avoid this problem the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least to safe you should wash it more often i have never had this problem with brita 's other products i have friends who never washed their brita pitchers for months and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it left over water due to the faulty design of the product there will be left over water both above the filter and below it besides turning the product upside down you can not dispense all of the water this is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product not surprisingly this helps further contribute to mold growth conclusion save your money and buy brita 's other well designed pitchers or even pure 's pitchers the key word is pitcher you will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product
i am editing this review for clarity no i am not talking about carbon this is one of the best brita filter systems i 've used i also use the large water cooler model that offers hot and cold dispensing and i 've used several pitcher sizes over the years this large dispenser fits almost anywhere and holds far more water than the pitcher sizes the valve works perfectly and closes securely so if capacity is more important than portability this is a great dispenser because of the valve kids can use this much easier than they might a full large pitcher my only problem with it is the stuff that grows in mine no that 's not the carbon all us brita users are used to ignoring it 's fuzzy stuff that grows in clumps and sticks to the plastic and is very hard to remove maybe that 's because the large upper reservoir remains damp and closed longer than a smaller pitcher system would and because it 's upstairs where my air conditioning does n't reach it 's hot up there most of the year and because of the relatively small but convenient filler opening it 's not easy to see into the reservoir through it so it 's easier to just keep filling without looking into it until filler time i was going to discard this but after realizing that nobody in the household got sick i decided to keep it i 'm leaving the rating in place because i ca n't edit it and because i 'm tired of household members who complain about the growths hey that 's what the faucet is for what do they think grows in there
i do n't usually write a bad review but i have to in this case this broke on the very first potato i put in it i never did get a single french fry out of it i then purchased the progressive cutter which cost less from amazon and it worked great
i have returned this item because the description indicated the fitted bottom sheet had elastic all around when i received it there was elastic only on the corners i am still waiting for my refund
unfortunately i did n't read the other review prior to purchase but i agree 100 sheets are not soft instead they are rough ! ! no way can these be 600 thread count egyptian cotton sateen
this set is anything but set is also very heavy washed several times and never got softer the only good thing is they are plenty big for a pillow top matress not worth the price
i was trying to go retro my old coffee pot had a grinder built in my new one did not so i decided to purchase this hand mill it is not very easy to use and does not grind very well plus the tray where the grounds are deposited is very small and tends to cause a mess it is on my kitchen countertop as an ornament i wish i would have returned it
after reading mostly rave reviews on this fryer i ordered it with great anticipation i should have heeded the other reviews and purchased a different fryer taking the advice of several reviewers i tried keeping the temperature at 350 degrees instead of 375 while frying battered fish in one basket and french fries in the other one the fish stuck to it 's basket and the fries were brown and soggy so i tried the same scenario with the temp at 375. the fish still stuck to the basket the fries were still brown and soggy even tried the '' method for the fries with no significant improvement in the crispness factor i was also disappointed with the long cooking time as another reviewer noted after a very long tiring and trying cooking experience i scrambled for my old faithful large pot piled in crisco and lovingly dropped in the rest of the fish ! ! perfection ! needless to say i am giving away this frying fiasco
i went for this fryer as a replacement for a well loved and much used unit for the two basket feature this is the reason for the first star true it does take 5 quarts of oil but on is frying 2 baskets at one time the problem arose with the two baskets at one time with the temperature cranked up to the max 375 degrees two one layer baskets of chicken wings took over twice the amount of time needed to fry and were greasy the second batch was after waiting a full 20 minutes to assume maximum recovery and those still fried much longer than needed time wise and were n't up to the level the old machine got them to clearly the one immersion element ca n't pull off heating that much oil next were fries greasy very greasy again i allowed extra time for oil temperature recovery the worse part was the heavy oil smell in the air it required the whole night to leave the kitchen and made the entire family shower immediately after dinner we all felt like we worked a double at the local rat trap this unit does n't have replaceable charcoal filters but a permanent metal one it does nothing to absorb odors this was with new oil and nothing 'smelly ' cooked only chicken and fries it was returned to the store the next morning after cleaning out and thus the second star because it was easy to clean up it was traded in for a rival gave up half the fry space but what an incredible difference
the description on color lists black lines gray it is actually dark brown tan it is pretty but if you are matching black or gray save yourself some time and pick something else corelle is wonderful quality
the description for these dishes is wrong ! there is nothing pewter black or gray in color on them the stripes are light and dark brown and the rest is a mottled brown
the jar is very nice looking but the spigot is most difficult to use it is a needle valve type spigot that takes about 8 turns to open and close by the time you get the valve closed most of your drink is on the floor i would not recomend this item
after waiting a month to receive this item i am very dissapointed in its functionality the spout is an inconvenient turn valve design as opposed to a push button i could get over this if it were the only problem but it is not if you want to use the jar as a dispenser you will need to remove the gasket on the cover otherwise you will have a vacumn in the container but even if you do this the flow is terribly slow and worse when the jar is nearly empty looks nice though might look good on a shelf with some pennies in it
i bought this vacuum and it was fine on carpet though a bit noisy it was awful on hardwood floors it blew the dust everywhere stay away if you plan on using it on anything besides carpet
i just want to say please do n't buy this vacuum '' here is why 1. when i vacuum on hardwood floors the dirt would shoot out from the back of the vacuum itself make my job twice as hard it does not do that on carpet though 2. it is heavy 3. the cable is short and so i have to keep on moving it to different plug in the other room 4. it blows air everywhere and so when i tried to vacuum my golden retriever 's hair i decided it 's better to use a broom instead 5. it is not wide enough you really get what you buy for a 'cheap ' vacuum do n't expect much from it ! !
although their coffeemakers do an excellent job of making coffee delonghi will use any excuse not to honor the warranty if anything goes wrong ! here 's my experience when i ordered my coffeemaker from delonghi it was backordered '' and took over a month to ship a little over 10 months after i received it the coffeemaker broke ! the heater coil went out and it would no longer make coffee since it had been over a year since i ordered it they said the warranty was expired despite the fact i had proof i had received it less than a year before i still had the shipping confirmation i explained this numerous times for a couple of months the various people i talked to kept telling me they would look into it '' but they never called back finally when it actually was over a year since i had received the coffeemaker when i called to check on the status of my warranty claim they said your warranty has expired you 've had this coffeemaker over one year there is nothing we can do '' i highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product ! i have a cuisinart now and it is wonderful !
i purchased this coffeemaker for my boyfriend when i opened the box you could tell that the item had already been removed when i took the coffeemaker out to my surprise there were still grounds in the filter area needless to say i was disappointed that i received a used '' coffeemaker i promptly returned the coffeemaker and purchased another at a local store
this has the potential to be a great toy there are two squeakers that make two different sounds and also some crinkly stuffing in part of the dog however in less than an hour my dog was ripping the stuffing out and that was after i had amputated the chewed up ears and tail even though i bought his on sale these things cost too much to last less than a day
my miniature poodle loves her bobo dog however they do n't last very long and do a good job of absorbing saliva so they become very stinky after just a couple of days of play better suited for use as a bath accessory than a chew toy i think
i bought this for my cavalier after watching the petsmart commercial i understand it is not the same toy but it bears some resemblence it came in a dreadful yellow color and was not extremely well made it was a soft somewhat texture not loofah ! i could n't tell you if it is durable because he has n't played with it enough to actually rip it it contains two squeakers that scare him my guess is some dogs would like this toy the shape is pleasing to dogs i think my dog just did n't like the texture i reccommend anything by fat cat in place of this toy
i personally am not happy at all with this item very small not the same as pictured the one i got is bright yellow really flimsy do n't think it 'll last very long i 'll keep it not worth sending back my corgi seems to like it but its a bit small even for her i think it 's life will be short not well made
ordered over 10 of these cute little loofa dogs expecting to receive color in photo i was sent pink purple ones over 6 phone calls to entirely pets and issue still not resolved told by at ext 201 beige colored dogs are to jan 07. was promise size upgrade and overnight shipping which never happened try to find at your local pat supply store save yourself the grief
the price entices you and then you lose any savings on the outrageous shipping charges
used the product for about a month i was deceived by the add thinking i was getting a knife sharpener with a electric grinding wheel like i had growing up on the back of the can opener the one on this can opener is just a slide though and does n't work well the unit is light weight and falls over easily with big cans the blade and lid carrier falls off quite a bit i did n't send it back because it was cheap and not worth the trouble if your looking for a can opener and an electric knife sharpener keep looking do n't buy this one
these towels seem to be of poor quality they are very light and quickly become saturated an average size person would probably need two of the bath towels to dry off after taking a shower little pieces of fuzz continue to come off the towels even if you wash them prior to first use
i bought this recently for gifting came in white box so using it myself it does n't have the quality of commercial nonstick that i am used to is right but the pan is very thin unlike the other pans in the line do n't think it 'll last not recommended it is probably worth ten bucks paid twenty
i too got the dinosaur pillow ! and laughed and laughed ! i do n't know whether to give it as a gag gift or not the trouble is that i really needed it for my neck do not buy this particular pillow if you want the small regular sized one
i made the mistake of buying this but what i got was not what is pictured the filters that came did not have the little red indicator that goes around and shows you when the filter has reached the end of its life i sent it back and the merchant returned my money but it was still a big hassle again please learn from my mistake do n't buy this product because you wo n't get what is pictured i have done some checking and from what i can tell pur has discontinued this particular filter the new one no longer has the life indicator if so this is the most stupid thing they could have done
this thing just does not get hot enough so what you 're supposed to be grilling gets steamed instead not very appetizin
while attractive the pump works poorly and the top does not screw properly to the bottle i constantly found one side popped up because the innards of the pour spout are too low preventing a proper fit when screwing the lid back on after removing most of the offensive innards '' the top now sits properly and to use it i just remove the top and pour my soap why because it 's still attractive sitting on my sink and pouring rather than pumping is no biggi
this thing never worked out of the not worth trying to rma it for the low cost of it but dont recommend it
buyer beware this item is junk the cheap plastic pump put out a dribble and the quit i should have read the other reviews before purchase i 'm surprised amazon continues to sell this after so many negitave reviews
this product is useless the pump broke after 1 week and the entire thing started to rust after not more than 2 weeks of use do not buy this product you 're throwing away your money ! i 'll reiterate 1 the pump breaks yielding the thing useless 2 it will rust after just 2 weeks and wo n't stop 3 do not bu
plastic internal pump cracked within a week soap leaks from top down sides in multiple streams looks great if you do n't use it and keep it away from water better keep it empty too
this dispenser is made of brushed stainless and looks and feels great unfortunately it wo n't pump soap the pump head is made of plastic and feels flimsy after using for about a day it apparently began to lose it 's prime '' and would only dispense soap after pumping repeatedly eventually it would n't pump at all and i returned it another example of a product ruined by
i bought six of these collars for my five cats i bought an extra just in case one of the cats lost one i thought the colors were great and i was happy with the idea of the material as opposed to cheap vynil they do look fashionable i think and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself however these collars are not breakaway '' collars they enlarge if they get caught on something but this actually only adds its own problems several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar and the collar extended as far as possible i hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something after getting the leg stuck one cat finally did come home without his and i did n't replace it another came home with the collar around her chest both front legs had gone through and it was constricting her i pulled to try to get it off but it was obviously very painful and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off i decided these collars are not very safe after all too bad i bought six at once the reviews at the time were pretty good generally i 've taken them all off and now my daughters can play with them on their stuffed animals they look do look cute ! i just do n't trust them on live animals
the metal pieces on the sides looked like they were going to slice my cat 's throat ! threw it in the garbage
it seems everyone loves this wok but i did n't have a very good experience with it i have cleaned and seasoned carbon steel pans in the past so i know how to do it but the factory coating that came on this one was impossible to remove completely i thought i had it cleaned off after following the directions and scrubbing and scrubbing however the first time i cooked with it the places where it simply would n't come off burned and turned sticky i ended up giving it away
am i the only one who thinks 55 is far too much to spend for a 1.5 quart saucepan
mak'n bacon made bacon '' for the company that sells this product cheesy material but not cheap hard to get all the bacon cooked without the tray getting too warm of course after you use it you ca n't return it for your money back easier and cheaper to use paper towels
i received this spoonrest as a free gift the only advantage i can see about it is that it matches the other corelle items in the pink trio pattern if i had to buy one i would opt for one in glass or pottery so i could be certain it would n't melt
like everyone else mine were white also dishonest creepy marketing i do know that red pigment is the most expensive so amazon probably got a deal and their customers get a white elephant sale so they can unload them after many years of absolute trust ! this puts amazon in a new light this has gone on so long we all trusted them to take care of it right it 's why we ordered anyway even after all the other complaints now it 's nothing less than a lie and this review is not spiteful it is truthful there is no red ! ! ! i know you wo n't post this but i 'll bet all the others you fooled would cheer !
i too just received my petite casserole in white too i thought after reading that many others got white by mistake that the problem would be corrected i am returning my white '' casserole and hope that i will be able to get the red '' one that i ordered
i read the reviews but because amazon has been so reliable over the years decided to order the red casseroles anyway my order arrived today and much to my displeasure i also received the white casseroles ! they 're being returned tomorrow and i 'm asking for a refund i do not want to take the chance of receiving another incorrect order my advice is do not order this casserole !
i too received a white instead of the red that i ordered i received an email stating that they are out of stock because they are unavailable from the supplier my thought is if they are out of stock why do they list them as in stock on the website then ship you the wrong thing they email you to tell them out of stock why not list them as out of stock or even remove it
while the product i received was identified as red imagine my surprise to find a white petite casserole like the many others who have had this problem i assumed it was just a freak '' accident no accident i am still looking for someone who actually got a red one very disappointed bummer ! ! ! ! ! !
i canceled my order after 3 shipments of the wrong color the shipping documents stated red but you consistantly shipped white it is hard to be happy with a product you never receive
for 20 i do n't even bother to return things but this article is a disgrace almost completely useless save your money
this looks good and bakes great but it is for individual use it holds about 2 cups not the 11 cups advertised update amazon has finally updated their description to indicate these are 2 cups
i have no idea how the item works but the description is misleading the item does not hold 11 cups it holds a little over 2 cups it is small and the picture and description do not convey this
i like the thickness of the spoon but did not like the length of the spoon it would have been perfect if it was few more inches long
advertising is very misleading for this item picture and description make it look like you are getting five collars but when the item shows up guess what one collar for 3.95 plus large shipping fees avoid this seller ! much better deals at the local pet store
i plugged it in and got through 1 shirt before it shut itself off and never worked again i guess you get what you pay for
i thought this little steamer would be perfect for removing wrinkles before i leave the house for work it worked great the first time that i used it but that was it since then it spurts water over the clothing leaving large wet a mess ! it is also dangerous because the steaming water spurts onto exposed skin as well i am careful not to fill the reservoir above the fill line i have gone back to using a wet towel and hairdryer to freshen clothing before i leave the house
this cutting board falls into the sink very easily making it only suitable as a decorator item i am very disappointed with it i much prefer an cutting board i purchased from the container store even though it 's white plastic board is not pretty to look at
i was excited to get this muffin tin so i could make a dozen muffins for my boys at a time and for a cheap price but like they say you get what you pay for the tin is nice to start off with but it rusts all over very easily so now after i know that the rust pretty much never comes off all the way and so i am stuck with it it is still very suitable for use with muffin cups liners so oh well
was excited to buy this item as i had lots of dull knives made by several manufacturers chicago cutlery victorinox and henckel i tried both sharpeners and the steel does an ok job but the ceramic wheels for fine sharpening '' butchered every blade i tried it on when i was done sharpening the knives the blades were jagged and looked like i was trying to cut concrete with them save your money on this one
i come here to buy items from amazon decent prices great shipping ease of use but lately more and more items such as this are coming from other companies i have no problem with this other than the fact there is no indication of this anytime during the transaction it took a for me to find out now i 'm forced to go chase macy 's around to find out where my order is out of protest for the ever increasingly poor service and deceptive item listings i am not making any more purchases through amazon for the rest of 2006. it 'll be much easier to just goto the other site in the first place than deal with order issues by way of proxy
i bought this paper towel holder because i wanted an under cabinet model with a brushed stainless finish to go with our kitchen remodel the big problem when you tear off a paper towel the whole roll comes off of the holder more times than not ! very annoying we have only had it for about three months my husband is so frustrated with it that he asked me to find a different one and specifically asked that i post a review here so that others will not waste their time and money
i use these alot and got this to replace a ge timer that had fried total junk the manual override '' function is just turn the dial until light is on or off as desired '' you must be freaking kidding me i got the 15 amp rated timer and it 's only 2 prong wtf you do n't run 15 amps without ground dumb as other reviewers noted it 's loud it often does n't even work properly save your money and just look for someone who has already bought one chances are they 've already determined it stinks and have it sitting in a drawer somewhere unused they 'll give it to you happily
i bought my light timer from target when i got it i thought hey this oughtta be a good one '' seeing as it 's made by timex i figured it would be a good buy i found out it was a piece of i would set the time just as it said on the back instructions i had everything set correctly when the day ran to i expected it to turn on but it did n't i pulled out my couch and looked behind it to find that the dial buttons on the timer had went all the way around with the ticker and pulled themselves next to eachother and the time had been reset no matter how many times i fixed it over and over again it would repeat the same process i was very annoied so on my attempt at setting it correctly i carefully read the instructions on the back of the timer set it making sure it was correct and pluged it in once more five o'clock rolls around and nothing happens when it turned to the light timer turned on i had the timer set to turn on time and turn off time the timer turned off at that was the one and only time it almost did something correctly today frustrated with the timer i tried setting it again well it 's broke now i twisted it the wrong way on purpose putting the horrible item out of it 's misery i would n't reccomend this timer to anyone
very cheap very flimsy will it last is the first question that comes to mind and the plug is really done badly it is a plug so any stuff will not work and most stuff is now how dumb ! at no cost difference they could have had a recepticle and made it safe with there is always the problem of safety at the 6.40 feel kinda duped but not worth the hassle to return would i buy again that is a firm no
the first star is because it fits the measurements are exactly as described the second star is because it does indeed hold things including spices the stars stop there i 'd give another star if the stainless steel was more than an afterthought save 50 and get the plastic version that 's what 90 of this product is after all cheap plastic i 'd give another star if this thing was sturdier it 's flimsy and the action '' is herky jerky at best contrary to the product listing it does n't fit any size bottle or tin by adjusting the shelves just as you like '' there are in fact very few shelf positions and one of the two shelves has only one placement option the bottom of this thing is one of the most visible parts they 've conveniently left it totally unadorned there 's none of that stainless steel to shine all and the cheap plastic that 's there did n't receive any aesthetic attention it 's rough and ugly get the plastic version and spraypaint it to match your kitchen you 'll be happier
i liked the look of these measuring spoons but i 've hardly used them the spoons are so wide even the smallest measure can not fit into any of my spice jars definitely impractible
this teacup has a beautiful design but i was very disappointed when i received it the cup and saucer were much thicker than i would have expected for a china teacup ! it also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer i sent it back as i could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup
my husband bought this item for me at costco for around 40 it looks impressive but its performance proves that looks can fool you first of all iy came with instructions for another item not a rice cooker i figured out that the water goes in with the rice and you close the lid and push the button it uses up the water before the rice is done then the rice laminates itself to the side of the pan i tried to use the steamer section but it did n't stay on long enough to even cook broccoli i tried to find out if it has any other uses but ca n't locate any information it takes up a lot of space do n't waste your money on one of these maybe i can plant herbs in it
looked foward to trying out my new oven 5 minutes after first test the upper elements failed to come on very dissapointed to say the least krups needs better qc on thier products i did order another one and will let you know what happens
i 'm returning my second sample of this today both pots i ordered are not despite amazon 's description even the literature shipped with the product says that it has their quantanium '' finish i own many other quantanium '' pans from cuisinart none of their interiors look like what has been shipped to me no wonder they can sell it so cheaply i am quite disappointed as i have been otherwise happy with cuisinart 's products
i bought this pot new and used it once to steam some fresh green beans i was shocked that after using it one time the inside was bare aluminum the dark grey hard anodized '' finish was completely gone my caphalon hard anodized cookware just gets better with use beware of this phony product
i have tried to get the all purpose spatula '' twice and amazon has sent me a which is completely different and does n't match this description
unfortunately i have to say i am disappointed with this coffee pot it is difficult to fill with water it drips when i pour coffee from the carafe it 's hard to get the carafe in and out it drips coffee all over the warming plate when using the function and the steam from the coffee burns my hand when i pour i could overlook all of this if it made a good pot of coffee but the metal carafe makes the coffee taste bad
i ordered this product online and received it with a broken lid feeling very disappointed i returned it and asked for a refund i used a label as this is not my fault unfortunately the cost of return shipping has been deducted from my refund and they said the return is not the result of their error i 'm very confused here i paid return shipping for someone else 's error
i should have listened to the reviews ! i just received it today and was very excited but that ended after it dulled my knife first of all the instructions sound easy run your knife across the two ceramic wheels several times until your knife it sharp and wala your knives are sharp ! not the case for me i have the wustof grand prix ii knives i was still practicing how to use my honing steel and did n't want to continue putting my knives through my torture training so i thought i could use this ceramic wheel until i got the hand of the honing steel i gripped the piece as told and ran it through with very gentle pressure pulling my knife through it was heartbreaking ! you could hear the knife resisiting the pull you 'll hear a screeching '' sound and no the ceramic wheels do not move when you are pulling it the knife just runs on top of where the two wheels connect and you pull yes your knife might scuddle and jump as you pull it is resisting the sharpener no matter how light you pull through ! ! i never dishwash my knives or let them airdry so you can imagine my dismay i just thought that is normal so i stopped running my chef 's knife through this and instead tried my smaller and easily replaceable paring knife same thing ! upon closer inspection you could see curved scratches along the side of the blade ! and little knicks along the blade it made my paring knife dull after only 3 runs ! very disappointed the wheels even look like they are about to fall of the piece ! the two wheel screws are so loose that with enough pressure for your knife i am convince it would eventually fall off do not buy this ! you might as well just run your knife along your steel kitchen sink ! you 'll probably get a sharper edge than this junk ! buy this only if you are stubborn like i was and ignored all the reviews and if you have want to junk your good wusthofs for the super dull supermarket knives then go ahead have fun destroying your knives ! wusthof should be ashamed of themselves to put their quality known name on this piece of junk ! now i have to send my knives to wusthof for sharpening ! arg !
my beautiful grand prix wusthofs are the best knives that i 've ever owned and i 've persuaded friends to buy them as well just by letting them borrow one even the cheaper stamped wusthofs that i had for a while are worlds better than any other knife that i had before so why did wusthof put their name on this damaging piece of hardware i used it on one knife and knew after that that it would never get near one of my knives again it dulled it so much that i had to take it in to get professionally sharpened do n't purchase this set ! you will regret it
i 'll start with i know how to sharpen knives i purchased the knive care kit to take care of my w sthof collection and i now have to take my knives to the hardware store for the w sthof kit made my knives dull and even chipped a section out of my wonderful chef 's knife i expected much more and ended up disappointed with somethin i ca n't
i ordered the plates and they were warped like they were from the outlet mall i was very dissapointed
glass broke second time shaker used entire glass base broke away from cylinder returned entire item to seller for refund
this product is very expensive it eats filters if on well water i have to clean the unit more frequently then is normal everytime i change the water and the filters when they work need to be changed once a week at a pop i bought this to avoid having to buy distilled water but that was a mistake it humidifies well but i know there are better cheaper ones out there
i purchased this unit from bb b and brought it home i unpacked the unit filled it with water and allowed the filter to soak got everything all set and turned the unit on light thought that maybe the outlet was bad and tried another one as well back to bb b for a replacement brought the replacement home and noticed that the little stopper for letting water past the filter was broken off so the water would just flow out when the tank was held with the handle figured no big deal i 'll just be quick getting it onto the base on starting it up plugged it in and turned the unit on light again like other posters i wanted to hurl this thing into the street and drive over it with my car ! ! ! i am going to be returning this to bb b and staying away from this company i guess i was being naive thinking that the more expensive unit is going to be the better built one
like so many others before me i too thought this would be the best humidifier and it was ! for about one week to boot this is my second one the first one had the exact same problem it ran perfectly for a week and then stopped producing any mist i tried all the troubleshooting tips in the extremely detailed and helpful manual '' i assumed i had broken the very sensitive oscilator and that it was my fault so like a fool i purchased a second ha ! same problem it took a lot of self control on my part to restrain myself from picking the thing up and throwing it across the room especially when you have a toddler who has chronic bronchial infections and you just want the darn thing to work here is my advice for anyone who has a broken one like me and has missed their window of opportunity to return it because they thought they could fix it step one open trash can step two hurl ventasonic into it step three slam lid on can
there is one huge problem with these sheets they are not permanently pressed there is no way to get out the wrinkles other than by ironing them otherwise they are fine but who in the world wants wrinkled sheets ! you should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles like your average sheet these sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed i can not believe you are actually selling these things
great price poor product they are beautiful upon arrival i washed them according to manufacturer 's instructions you would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer usually a sign of poor fabric quality while folding them up i discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed and i had n't even used them yet ! unbelievable i returned them for a full refund including shipping and i stupidly purchased 2 sets goes to show you get what you pay for never again
the pan does n't have a coating so the rice sticks go figure not a bad brand from what i hear i just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating
this is not a when i cook rice it sticks to vessel becoming difficult for cleaning
so i just bought this item does it work i do n't know i have n't tested the water yet to see if it has actually reduced the amount of chlorine in the water but what does make me suspicious of this product is that one of the reviews for this product is the same on amazon as it is on other sites selling this product it seems likely then that the manufacturer of this item finds it necessary to plant reviews do you really want to patronize a business that falsifies reviews of its products
since dualit makes a great toaster i assumed their percolator would be good i was wrong there is an excess amount of coffee grinds in the coffee even with coarse ground coffee in addition the coffee continues to boil and after a while smells like it is burning very disappointing the only nice thing is that it is cordless
after this percolator stopped working we were instructed to send it to dulalit 's service center for repair electra craft customer service at the repair center was very unprofessional they would tell us the package was shipping out to us and nothing would arrive it was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition it took them four months to return the percolator to us they refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund we unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one i had to contact electra craft again they were able to provide the part a simple stainless steel lid for 25.00 plus shipping and handling ! i 'm sure their other replacement parts are overpriced as well
i purchased this for christmas 2003 wish i had read the reviews auto shut off did not work grounds in the bottom of the pot and the burnt coffee all too true after 11 months of regular use the bottom is now leaking i will be writing dualit to see what they can do for us i am ready to go back to my good old braun
after my first cuisinart hand mixer died from 10 years of heavy use i decided to be brand loyal now i am questionning my decision the buttons for speed seem to be backwards not intuitive ! i would prefer they were reversed beyond that the button to eject the beaters cracked and the pieces fell inside the mixer after just a few uses additionally the power seems weak especially for cookie dough i am very disappointed
i bought this hand mixer based on the quality implied by the cuisinart name i had had their processor for over 20 years huge mistake cuisinart 's quality has gone downhill in those 20 years this mixer lasted barely a year diving downward the entire year but not so far as to call in a warrenty claim besides i had had to deal with cuisinart 's customer service in getting a part for the food processor and did n't have the heart to try that again they berate you for misusing '' their products even if you 're not complaining and it is only a wear issue weird anyway this mixer is done for it was never able to handle cookie dough so i never asked it to after a couple of tries they offer a dough hook but that 's fiction do n't buy it do n't try it walk the other way ps i was so blinded i thought it was just me and not cuisinart and replaced the old worn food processor a few months ago with a new cuisinart anyway the new supposedly equivalent processor is a total bust very weak i ca n't believe it so cuisinart has dropped off my list of reliable companies too bad that old processor was really good for 20 years of hard use
go to ebay there is one seller whose ebay id is valuecrate they sell metal pans that are durable and tough
i thought i was the only one having trouble with the crate pans i have a golden retriever and have the crate only six months and the crate pan totally broke apart i can not find a replacement for it i have one on order from wholesale but after reading the other review i am going to cancel my order i do n't know what to do for my puppy now i truly am disappointed with the product
do n't let the description on these plastic crate pans fool you years of use '' and durable '' these pans crack and break within weeks of use the manufacturers have gotten cheap and do n't want to make the metal crate pans anymore it 's as simple as that if you can find one get a metal pan plus lots of dogs hate the slick flimsy feel of these plastic pans it will actually make them hate going into their crate ! avoid these at all costs
i 'm currently looking for another crate pan for my dogs wire midwest crate the plastic pan is not durable at all the first crack appeared when my dog boxer was only 5 months old now she is 18 months and the pan has several cracks in it luckily she does n't have any accidents while being crated ! ! i 'm just now replacing it because the local pet stores in my area including petsmart does n't carry them in their store i 'm told everywhere i go to check online in my opinion the crate pans are way too expensive to have to keep replacing them
i have a rottie and the large wire crate with the abs plastic pan aweful aweful aweful the tough durable '' plastic pan has cracked 3 times in 2 years the first time midwest replaced it for free the second time they basically said too bad and i had to buy it not 6 months passed before i had to buy another there is no other pan that fits this size cage i tried to buy a metal one from jb pet and it was lower quality than hvac metal and came damaged 2 times from ups also i have a water bottle attached to the side which drips occasionally onto the abs pan when i let my dog out she brings black paw prints out to the white carpet
i was wooed by the hype it 's cute it 's small it 's sparkly green to be honest i 'm not much of a housekeeper but this seemed like a vacuum i 'd enjoy using it appealed to my aesthetic and generally got good reviews on consumer sites plus it was inexpensive what more could i ask for thing is vacuum cleaners really only have one purpose sucking and while i looked really good pushing this one and felt a certain futuristic sense of modernity toting the lightweight frame around it simply stopped working after a few weeks of occasional use something deep within it is clogged and no amount of canister emptying filter scrubbing or tube plunging will help it needs some ind of vacuum angioplasty that will likely cost more than the machine is worth so i 've learned my lesson do n't be wooed by packaging because a vacuum that does n't suck is a large paperweight that only serves to collect dust in a manner other than that for which it was intended
do not buy this vacuum if you have a pet cleaning out the canister is a very messy job and the dirt and pet hair stick all over the filter replacement filters are difficult to find and must be ordered i 've put up with this vacuum for a year and i 'm now buying a new bagged vacuum i 've put up with it this long because it is very lightweight it has a nice retractable handle and you can set it to suction only '' and use it on bare floors but cleaning out the dirt and pet hair is messy messy messy
i was extremely disappointed by the size of this item it is for an individual serving i would not purchase this item again never also felt the color was off not a true red more like a coral
very disappointed to find out the size was wrong i should have looked at the other reviews and i would never have bought it it was sent as a gift and i am not happ
i really thought this was a big enough bowl to make soup for a family of 6 and it turns out that this is made to fill enough soup for 1 only this is a great item i was just misled to think it was a large dutch oven next time i make individual french onion soup this will come in handy
this is not a 13 cup capacity it 's about 2 cups ! do not be fooled
this is a nice fridge magnet to hold pieces of paper on your refridgerator not so much to sharpen knives it 's hard to get the right angle to make a keen edge and is n't a very tool i just got the presto brand electric sharpener and for only twice the price of this hunk of plastic it does an awesome job look for that instead
i could n't tell any difference in the degree of sharpness on the knives before use and after
we bought this crate as new puppy parents of a labrador retriever we liked the look of it and it seemed more than the metal crates we had seen unfortunately we were very wrong ! originally it was way too big and is virtually impossible to section off as our puppy was being trained therfore we had a lot of accidents which were more difficult to clean with this crate a metal crate the final demise came when my dog chewed a hole in the bottom of the crate and finally pawed at the side so that her toe nail punchered the netting and ripped a hole which she was able to escape from thankfully she did not hurt or strangle herself but the possibility is there my suggestion go with a simple metal crate a divider and bottom pan they are easy to clean and can grow with your dog to mention less expensive
the lock on the left side of the cabinet is in a stupid place in order to unlock or lock you have to remove the dvd 's on the top shelf to do it if you do n't lock it then the door will swing open i had to purchase another locking system to keep the door from swinging open plus there is a plank of wood you put in the cabinet right in front of your dvd 's you have no idea what the movies are until you take two or three out to get at it i am wondering is this piece necessary
the would is nice and it seems not to stress when full other then that not much good to report i should take about a half hour to build but because the directions are so bad that it will take you hours there a step that you set the center beam and it gives you what holes to use for cds and dvd then it says adjust for vhs 9 inch boxes and other height but this is one of the first steps its like ask you to fit your set in a car when you only have the 4 wheels on they could not spend anther few cents to put magnets on door so they do not open by themselves you will have to go buy them yourself this could be nice if they spent a little bit more time on this get some bookends and magnets will help a lot because of how its made the magnets have to line up with the outer frame of the door not near the lock end this need work if your paying over 230 your paying to much
i bought the cabinet awhile ago now and the first thing i noticed was that the lock '' was plastic the second was that it did n't even reach the slot made for it to keep the door closed now i 've started noticing that the front doors are sagging from the weight of the dvd 's inside not worth it and is n't worth taking with on a move
the design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear
i have used this ice cream maker 4 times and on the time the metal pin that turns the paddle broke i find that the metal pin only goes into the plastic paddle about 3 inches the ice cream froze on the sides of the bucket and the plastic paddle could n't turn the frozen cream causing the paddle to crumble i would not recommend this to any one as it is cheaply made
this is a piece of junk ! ! ! ! the beater inside broke while making the first batch of ice cream and the ice cream had n't even frozen totally
i was really looking forward to this pillow i have heard good things from my friends about them first night was a bit odd the pillow is very firm and takes some getting used to i could also feel little beads under the cover between the pillow and the cover during the second night i could feel there were more little beads under the pillow case i looked to see what was going on in the middle of the night the pillow was leaking beads at an end seam this is like a bean bag leak but the beads very small so after two nights this thing goes back and i clean up the beads i am disappointed as the pillow itself felt good but this is a mess i am opting for a refund of the product and shipping i do n't think i want to roll the dice on a replacement i 'll find something else
first the bad news the amazon product description is misleading well wrong in fact this coffeemaker does n't come with a thermal carafe in reality the carafe is very thin aluminum like lightweight metal cookware that you buy for backpacking so not just not thermal but this sucker gets hot when it 's full of fresh coffee also it does n't have a permanent filter '' it has a standard plastic filter basket and comes with a reusable nylon filter nothing wrong with that it 's nice to get one packaged with the machine actually but the above description of a permanent filter basket '' is n't accurate the water tank maxes out at 28 which is enough for two big 16 oz mugs at my house since i 'm the only coffee drinker this is fine on the other hand it was as inexpensive as it is cheaply made despite the ridiculous deliberately misleading retail price listed as of march as i write this it says it retails for 85.99 ! i got it for ten bucks plus shipping and it 's worth about that add shipping cost and it was under 20 and it 's programmable it 's worth noting that the programmable function turns off the hot plate after two hours but if you use the coffeemaker manually you have to remember to turn it off yourself so that you do n't i assume melt the cheap metal carafe it looks nice on the counter it makes coffee for me it 's a perfectly acceptable replacement coffeemaker that i bought on the spur of the moment when my previous machine broke but that 's all it is a temporary replacement in this case you get what you pay for and i 'm saving my pennies to get a better coffeemaker in a couple of months
found product to have serious flaws however i still like the design
i had an old black decker spacemaker which broke after about 10 years of daily use i bought this product as a replacement it looks sleek takes up very little space but has one tiny flaw does n't open cans in order to open a can you have to tilt the can just right under the locater post '' and even then the one i have opens a can maybe only 1 out of 20 tries maybe i got a lemon but in any event its not even worth returning it after considering shipping etc i 'll just buy another brand and eat this one do yourself a favor pass on this product
i also bought one of these to replace an old b d spacemaker that was around 8 years old my old one was nasty looking yellowed but still worked good i should have kept it because this new one is a piece of crud ! it is very hard to put the can on and open it takes me tries and the bottle opener is side to side now instead of front to back making it very hard to open a bottle i am very disappointed in it and we have been using a manual can opener instead of this one thats hanging under the counter will be coming down very soon
i bought one of these can openers today the mounting screws stripped out even before i got it completely mounted the screws thread into soft metal tabs instead of nuts making it impossible to mount securely i do n't know if it would open a can as i never got that far but it looks difficult to locate the can properly it 's a piece of cheap chinese made junk
i purchased this model yesterday this morning i decided to install it under my cabinet and per the instructions held up to the bottom of the cabinet for lever placement after several minutes of this it went back in the box so i can return it to the store there was not enough clearance for the lever to be pulled up so the can could be placed on it actually if there were a no star rating i would use it based on the fact that the can opener was out of the box for all of 5 minutes before it went back in
the peeler does a fantastic job of peeling potatos having said that the cheap engineering for the cheap plastic gears causes it to fail prematurely after beautifuly peeling 50 lbs of potatos the dinky cheap plastic motor gears stripped and quit
i 'm not a big guy so i was surprised that within a few weeks the pillow had already started to loose its shape in the end it caused me so many problems with my back that i had to stop using it such a waste of money
these pillows are too soft and too small they do n't provide adequate neck support and are more uncomfortable than the pillows i bought them to replace
i have a less expensive cordless sweeper that is doing a great job but i thought i would give this cordless a try i have been very disappointed in it 's performance i have allot of pets and hair has always been a problem instead of this vacuum picking up the hair a large amount of hair seems to sick to the bottom of it so i have to constantly pick up the vac to shake it off and then let the vacuum give it another try i have another vacuum not a shark that picks up almost every bit of hair and puts it where it belongs the only thing i like about this vacuum is the disposal system where as it pops out to empty so you really do n't have to touch the dirt in any way i have also used it on the carpet but it really does n't do a very good job i am very tempted to return this vacuum and buy two more vacuums of the one i have for what this vacuum cost me linda florida
this is my second pro sweeper and my third shark sweeper the first model lasted almost three years so when i saw the pro i upgraded because of it 's few extra features it was fantastic for about a year and then it just did n't work anymore i bought a new battery and cradle for it still nothing after much thought i decided to just buy a new one to my dismay the cradle i had just purchased for the very same model did n't work for my new one i am not a glutton for punishment i just found myself invested in accessories for this model as it happens the second improved '' pro model does not work as well or last as long as the first one did additionally do not expect anything from this company with regard to customer service ! if you actually get a living breathing person on the line it is unlikely you will be able to understand them because of a thick accent and horrible long distance connection overall i am done with shark
i do n't get so many honest people struggle to stay in business each day but these guys are still going the sad part is this machine would be good if it actually worked for more than 2 weeks i want to say it sucks but that 's the whole problem it does n't
this sweeper worked fine for the first few times and then in the middle of a task it would n't turn on i contacted the company and they said it probably was the battery they sent me a new battery it did n't work i called them again and they said i had to charge the battery before it could work i could n't charge the battery because it does'nt work i called them again and they told me to send it back at my own expense and include payment of 16.95 to return it i told them that this was a new machine and i did n't think i should have to pay again they waived the 16.95 i am still waiting for it to be returned i bought it two months ago and so far i have only had the use of it for about a total of ten minutes
this item is aggravation plus it may or may not work out of the box if it works dont get used to it because it will probably die within a few will cost almost 30.00 with shipping to have it replaced under their so called warranty '' i can honestly say that if they were 100 free shipping i would not want or accept another one amazon should stop selling all shark no one should sell these shark products
i bought this item as a holiday gift it is a very beautiful piece and is artisitcally designed well when we went to set it in its stand however the lip of the neck brushed the wire frame and chipped ! i was shocked that it broke so easily it 's possible that they connected at just the right point and it was mere coincidence but i am not getting another one to find out beware
i am very very disappointed with this product i was so excited to get it because i thought it would clean my tile that i have such a problem getting clean nope ! ! i ca n't even get the mop pads to stay on ! they keep ripping off the sprayer does n't spray very well and the scrub brush works when it wants too save your money !
i was very disspointed in this product it is much heavier than i thought the scrubber head moves as described but does n't remove dirt from crevices with any efficiency a sponge and elbow grease would do the job faster the bottle that contains the liquid gets jammed so the liquid is unable to squirt on to the floor the lever that switches the mop head to scrubber is awkward and retracts at times there is n't a good thing to say about it
i was all excited that i could put any solution i want in it and that it had a scrubber but when i got it it was so hard to put together then the cleaner i put in started to leak then the handle part kept on coming apart then it did n't look right the mop pads are a joke they do n't just come off when you turn the knob which i ca n't even do that it does not take any mop pads because the swiffer wet jet mop pads are my fave and i had to put velro on the bottom so that they would work on it and most of all the thing is so heavy you have to have some upper body streanth just to move it the scrubber head is no were near how big it look on tv it was a very big dissapointment not to mention it was my xmas present to my self black and decker should stick to power tools and leave the mops up to swiffer i love my swiffer wet jet best mop i have ever used wish they would make it so i could use any cleaning solution that i wanted though

i am disappointed in this cheese slicer i had a similar one manufactured by the same company it lasted for about 15 years ! this cheese slicer does not cut all the way through the cheese because the slot in which the wire sits is uneven
the first time using the product two of the stainless steel wires broke ! i am still able to use part of the slicer but it is not effective
i actually bought one of these in the store and was browsing amazon for a replacement the fact that most of the ones in the store display were broken should have been a tipoff the wires that do the slicing were all broken these were all the had so i thought i 'd give it a shot it did n't even make it home several of the wires came unattached from the ends i 'm hoping maybe they just had a bad batch though i usually like kitchenaid products i certainly would n't recommend this item to anyone
do not even think about ! ! ! i love kitchenaid products but what a lemon they should be ashamed the first one broke during shipping the second one on the first use i do not recomend go and get the mushroom egg kiwi slicer built with blades to last not thin wire
we received this vac as a housewarming gift and i thought that it was great the first 3 times i used it then the attachments would not stay on during use it lost suction and it died the time i used it this product was seriously disappointing my dyson vaccume has such great attachments that i will never use a handheld like this one again
i bought this for 5 and while it did an ok job at picking up little things it did after only a handful of uses i was considering sending it back to get a new one but the warranty requires you to send them 8.95 to cover shipping that 's more than i paid and frankly more than i think it 's worth the mini turbo shark is now sleeping with the fishes
please see my review of the 'mr coffee switch coffeemaker black ' we 're on our second one and both leaked badly
as several other reviewers said the clock lost several minutes a week requiring that it be periodically this was tolerable since the coffee it made was decent then about 2 months after i bought the unit it stopped working altogether the on '' light would illuminate but nothing would happen i only use this pot once a day hardly heavy use this should n't have happened
firstly this product is useless as is the dock will not stay above water you must silicone it to your tank for it to remain stable that being said it is inappropriate for this usage as well it is made of styrofoam which a turtle with claws will rip apart and will eat the pieces my adult res broke off the entire corner of the dock and there was a large metal spike protruding pointing in the exact direction the turle climbs from i suppose this is the inner armature it is not a metal wire which would be dangerous enough but a thick very sharp spike i actually broke skin by touching it while trying to photograph it sending a letter to the company i consider myself very lucky that my turtle did not impale himself stay away from this product if you would like a ramp i suggest getting a piece of cork bark and siliconing it to your tank
i ordered the large turtle dock and did not receive the suction cups or the support bracket i have emailed the company twice with no response i have tried to call and i get no where so for three weeks now my turles have a raft and float away from the lamp
i too had the opportunity to purchase this lovely '' dock first let me state that it sunk as soon as my turtles climbed upon it the suction cups did not hold and the next morning i found it floating upside down with my turtles taking a ride around the tank also within a week i kept finding chunks of stuff '' floating in the tank and blocking the filters the stuff '' i discovered was pieces of the floating dock for some reason my turtles feel it is a food item and continue to peck at it save your money and your sanity buy something else or make your own dry area
there is a lie on the side of this box it reads available in 3 sizes to easily accommodate any size aquatic turtle '' i have two red ear sliders probably the most common of all aquatic turtle pets and they are large so i bought the largest size of this turtle dock forget my big turtle who did n't even try to climb on this thing the smaller of my two turtles sunk this he probably weighs in at 3 or 4 pounds he certainly does n't look any larger than the turle they show on the box yet when he climbs on it the whole floating thing submerges so that half his body is under water the same rods mechanism that allows it to float at any water level and keeps it connected to the side of the tank also lets the thing sink if your turtle is too heavy for it which proves the other lie on the box that it allows aquatic turtles a dry basking area '' i am very disappointed in this product and unless your turtles are under a pound in weight i do n't think it works despite their promise that is accommodates any size aquatic turtle and because i tried it now i ca n't return it to the amazon merchant thanks a lot zoo med
i really trust the reviews i read before purchasing an item ! this one was a letdown ! ! the sheets were soft at first i washed them before putting them on my bed and there was an enormous amount of fuzz and pilling of the sheets on the second washing no improvement and probably worse ! ! i am so disappointed in the quality ! the only good thing i can say about them is the color is pretty and has not faded with the washings but so what with all the pilling and fuzzs that accumulate at the foot of the bed ! ! ! avoid these
for the of power that it draws this provides about the amount of warmth that a vaccum cleaner provides by friction on a carpet quite pointless
while this little heater creates heat it isnt what i wanted at all first of all i realized that it has no safety features if it tips over unto the rug it just keeps going ! a real fire hazard also also the front heat control knob says off '' you cant really turn it off without pulling the plug out of the wall rather inconvenient and as one of the reviewers mentioned its a real drain on a circuit throwing the circuit breaker in the first day of use last year i bought a pelonis for less and it was far better
this heater blew a fuse twice in my office causing my coworkers ' computers to shut down and lose unsaved information the darn thing comes on for 2 seconds every 5 minutes so i 'm constantly cold i would recommend one where you can change the fan setting to go at all times on low without the thermostat stepping in and ruining a good warmth also does n't turn off unless you unplug it so i have to crawl under my desk everytime i leave the office no fun want to return but it 's too much of a hassle
these are not at all what i was expecting to me these are tiny bowls they measure 5 inches across top
i 'm on my second sassafras pizza stone the first broke in half after maybe a dozen uses the second now has distinct cracking after about a half dozen uses i treat my kitchen tools well following all care instructions these are just plain dogs do n't waste your money the only saving graces are that they 're cheap and hence easy to replace and that they really do help make good pizza
this product is a great idea unfortunately the design is just really poor installation went pretty smooth the problem is that the thing is really unstable it flexes bends and wobbles basically it 's just not supported very well to add insult the cover that came with it does n't fit i 'd strongly recommend you look for one of those mini table top irons if you want something to do touch ups
bought one of these in my search for a good cheese grater to replace my sadly inadequate kitchenaid rotary model see reviews on this before buying they capture the problems well after using this once you have to ask what were they thinking '' the cutting disks can fit into the device both ways though only one way cuts the disk is difficult to line up properly in the unit and frankly does n't cut well with my main use for parmigiano reggiano it almost powders it worse the circular hand motion needed to grate is fine for say a pepper mill for which only a small amount is needed for this the repetitive twisting and small yield are unacceptable for those of you like me who have and love the superb and unbeaten kitchenaid stand mixers this device and the rotary grater are not in anywhere near the same quality and usefulness league another cheese grater of no value to me
i wish i could write a good review of this coffee machine capresso in general but unfortunately my experience with the 455 model capresso itself has been horrible i bought my capresso 455 stainless carafe model in july 2006. i was very impressed with the grinding options the overall functionality of the machine the coffee it produced was great but by september the electronics had failed the lcd readout was going haywire i called capresso they immediately sent out a brand new machine to replace the faulty unit the new unit worked perfectly until february 2007 when the drip basket stopped working it would no longer stay in place when i tried to swing it over under the grinder to start the process i again called capresso they told me to pack it up send it back for repairs i then got a voice message telling me that they had never received the original unit that i had sent back in september 2006 so they would n't perform the repairs on this unit until they received it back i wo n't waste your time with all the phone calls that took place about this ! suffice it to say that i had sent the machine back i had never heard a word from capresso in the 7 months since that time now they were expecting me to somehow track their ups return label to prove that the machine had been delivered ! ! i finally convinced them that there was nothing i could do about it now they agreed to complete the repairs return the machine to me but without any warranty the kicker to the story is that when the repaired machine finally arrived it had brand new internal damage to it the broken pieces were all over the inside of the water resevoir has had to be returned yet again naturally i have written to the president of the company about this ridiculous situation while much of this problem can be written of as a bad customer service experience the fact is that i have had 2 mechanical failures on this machine within a year as well as additional damage caused by the repair technicians i 'm fairly certain that it was not caused during the shipping the unit was extremely well packed my advice is this if you can find another machine that does the same things as the capresso 455 give it a shot while this coffee maker performs superbly when it actually works 2 failures on different machines within a year is not a good track record i also found their customer service department to be extremely unhelpful as soon as they had identified me as a problem customer '' i never had a leg to stand on once they said they had n't received the machine from the return call tag that they had issued why in the world would i have wanted to keep a machine that did n't work in the first place buy at your own risk
this coffee maker is just what i was looking for but considerably more money that i wanted to spend on a coffee pot after reading all the reviews here at amazon i was convienced to go ahead and pull the trigger all i can really say is that for 300 i really expected more if i had paid 30 at walmart for it it would be in the trash can by now but after blowing half a truck payment on it i am stuck with at least trying to make it work first the grinder seems to keep getting plugged up while the grinder runs the alloted amount of time the beans do not fall from the hopper into the grinder and so less than enough beans end up ground into the basket and you get watered down coffee second the basket is supposed to swing over from the grinding station to the brewing station after grinding is complete it just does n't have enough spring power to make the trip and stops just short which means that the hot brewed coffee is split between the pot and the counter i am what i consider a good consumer i compare prices to an extent but quality is what i am after and if i find a good product i will spend to get the best i have to say that i was caught off gaurd this time if i had n't already discarded the box and packing i would be sending it back after rereading the above reviews i must really be doing something wrong good luck
these are really nice substantial weight classic design functional the white is a slightly white not at all creamy if you 've been looking at a lot of white dishes you 'll appreciate the distinction the problem is that the manufacturer or distributor does n't pack them with enough care i ordered two sets to try them out before putting them on my wedding registry both arrived with broken bowls then i ordered replacements and one of those arrived broken so after calculating that i 'd have to field up to 32 boxes to get 8 intact place settings i gave up fortunately amazon is very good about returns for broken
while the examples of place settings are lovely they are not for me interested in busier '' patterns patterns thank
we bought this lg stainless steel toaster for our office and the nightmare has started ever since we 've had them we bought 2 for about half a year now there are still people including myself sometimes standing in front of the mechanism hopelessly and trying to figure out what they are looking at and how they should use it there is no primary visual clues that guide you through the using process all the buttons look exactly the same the captions under those buttons as equally confusing in short you can only force yourself to get used to it let alone taking pleasure of using the product personally it does n't matter how good it performs because all the aggravations you get from the user interface are enough to kill a good brand like lg my advice think twice on this item
these shakers are adorable very small and cute but unless you look closely at them it 's very easy to mix them up my husband has fits over them and swears he 'll find a way to mark them s '' and p '' if i do n't switch them out often we 'll use the larger range shakers by fiesta instead of these buy the range shakers instead of these if you can find them i bought mine from amazon
thought this would be a perfect drinking glass my husband cracked it the first time he used it all he did was brush it against another object very expensive item for it to be so fragile
these glasses are very attractive to look at but they are too delicate for every day use i broke one while washing it after just several uses and have n't used the other one since they will sweat a little bit when holding iced drinks
bought something similar small crack between the seams where the two walls join after less than a month 's use
i received these glasses and both were craked during shipping they were well packed but just way too delicate i 'm sure that during use they would have cracked on their own you 're better off to order the plastic ones
due to the size of our turkey this year and the haphazard job of getting turkeys out of the roasting pan all prior years this item became a major hunt for us it was sold out everywhere locally unfortunately the rack was less than a good thing the end result was a burn hazard '' coating flakes stuck to the turkey three hours of cleaning and a rack that rusted due to the loss of its coating onto the turkey in detail the first discovery was that since the roasting pan itself was relatively larger than the rack it allowed the whole rack to slide around inside the pan throwing things off balance to a great degree and undoing any light covering like foil that spanned the pan several foil corrections later and everything went into the oven slipping around and endangering me with scalds against the oven itself as i had to attempt to right it i should have taken the sliding as a hint and reconsidered the danger from putting the item into the oven was nothing compared to the hazard of taking it out as it slid around with a turkey inside a pan the rack performed as advertised for ease of lifting the turkey out of the roasting pan removing the center pin proved to be a endeavor with one person holding both sides of the rack and the second pulling the pin this is the only thing it did as advertised we discovered the flaking off of a good portion of the coating onto the turkey itself to be the next issue we discovered that the '' coating really is n't as being another thing to consider cleaning the thing proved to be one of the largest washing challenges i 've had to undertake the rusting out thereafter makes this a product for us as a caveat the sliding and burn hazard can be mitigated by having a roasting pan that is much smaller or finding a method to stabilize the rack inside toe roasting pan however after examination of the tight curve and bow of the rack and potential solutions my wife and i could come up with nothing for ideas that most reasonable people would care to undertake the curve and height means that a smaller pan would need to actually have substantial height be small enough to hold the base securely but not contain the upper portion fully
after 36 years my all metal corkscrew came apart in my hands this one is flimsy in comparison and there is no way that i think it will last even 20 years
i gave this espresso maker to my daughter as a christmas gift unfortunately the '' switch broke after the second try amazon delivered it quickly on time was wonderful about returning it and issuing a refund
delonghi has some serious quilty issues i started with a lesser model '' and as each one has broken i have been upgraded see my blog for more on that http a few weeks ago i received the delonghi espresso maker in the mail after 3 yes only 3 uses the lever that controls the steam knob broke off just ripped right off i contacted the regular customer service and they were no help even though this was a replacement for several other broken ones they want me to take the time to bring it in to a service place and wait again to have it fixed i got in touch with the vp i had been dealing with once i found his number and he is much more responsive promised to send me a new factory tested model '' today but can all the problems i 've had with all the delonghi espresso makers be just a coincidence i do n't think so the quality just is n't there buy from another manufacturer if you want one that will last as they keep breaking and i get tired of calling in and having them replaced again and again i plan to eventually invest some money in a good quality unit from someone else run do n't walk and whatever you do do n't buy !
i purchased this espresso maker about months ago i have used it about times per week my first disappoinment was the frothing wand not only is it placed in a place in which it is difficult to get a mug of milk or water for cleaning without first sloshing some on the counter second the shape and style of the wand does all the frothing itself if i wanted an automatic frother i 'd have bought something cheaper this allows no proper room for style for someone who has not operated as a professional barista this may be fine but i prefer to have more control over how much and what type of foam i create thus i purchased a nicer machine '' or so i thought for the most part i am pleased with the espresso itself i most often get a healthy creme and when i do n't i 'm sure it 's operator error improper tamping or whatever one week ago i made a latte and left to run some errands i returned to find all my incoming and outgoing mail sopping wet perplexed i took a good look around the counter and noticed that the water carafe in my espresso maker was empty i always fill it after making the last latte and remembered doing so before i left i have absolutely no idea how this managed to get cracked i called the customer service for delonghi and requested a replacement i was not asked many questions and the item will be shipped at no charge however they tell me that it wo n't arrive for weeks in the meantime i am only able to put enough water in the tank to make one latte i had thought this was the machine to last me for years but now i am wondering how long it will really hold out
i currently own a briel which has been working fine and i thought i would try a delonghi in my summer home the delonghi broke on me in a week getting a new one shipped out and sending the broken one back was easy but it was a week wasted
after using an inexpensive krups machine for 2 years my wife gave in and we agreed to buy this delonghi the machine we got had a cracked plastic water tank and a broken tray delonghi customer support is outsourced and worthless andreplacement parts were out of stock and backordered we exchanged it for another and the power button did not keep the unit on you had to physically hold down the power button finally the third machine we got was totally doa ! it would n't even turn on finally we were told that they were getting alot of these machines back and customer service told us to steer clear buyer beware we went back to our 50 krups so far
as a home espresso brewer i was delighted to receive the as a holiday 2004 gift it was a nice upgrade from my existing machine well it 's been less than 2 months and i 'm glad i did n't toss the old machine when i got the delonghi because without it i 'd have no morning brew the rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber i 've visited delonghi 's website but it 's incomplete does n't appear to have been updated since it went online in march 2004 and the customer service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is no longer in service '' i 'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure but delonghi ca n't or wo n't stand behind their product quality beware
i received this product in good shape however it makes loud noises when it is heating almost like fire cracker had to return and get a replacement amazon provided excellent service quickly shipped a second one and took the first one back without charging me shipping
the heater does not function well the foot button is very diffifult to use and requires using my hands repeatable to get it to turn on or off the timer is a sometimes thing not very reliable i am very tech savvy and did n't get much help from the manufacturer i had selected this product based on a prior purchase from the manufacturer which was a good product
i ordered this from amazon and received it in about 2 days unfortunately the foot pedal is broken so i have to return it my other delonghi has lasted for about 20 years so i will get a different model
well i had really high hopes when i got this for christmas and even before i tried it for the first time i read through all of these ratings and followed what many were saying are the 'tricks ' i have had it now for over half a year and tried to use it probably about 10 times and have yet to get a pot to brew correctly every single time to filter clogs not allowing but only or so of the coffee to come back down i have set my coffee grinder to max coarse all these times and no i dont store my beans in freezer or refigerator i make sure the rubber seal is seated good and i have also tried overfilling the lower carafe with water per suggestion here i have also put it back on the heat momentarily to try to unclog it but it still will only drain down maybe an inch at most after removing i must say i am somewhere between an average joe and a coffee connoisseur but i really dont think this is priced at connoisseur pricing i mean i have spent about 50 on good auto drippers and electric percs my favorite is the manual maker right over the mug that was like 5 where i can control all aspects of the brew and much quicker and less hassle than the santos but not a very good show piece perhaps i need a new grinder i am pretty sure mine is a burr mill it wasnt cheap maybe i need more expensive coffee i am already using stuff that costs about what the cheap stuff is and refuse to pay any more or have to special order it or something i mostly enjoy the flavor of some organic 'breakfast blend ' from a local shop i am quiet happy with my my electric perc my manual perk my manual drip if only this coffee maker could do what my others could do without all the fuss and ruined pots of coffee it might be that you need to have the upmost quality of beans and precision grinder i dont really know since i cant get it to work but any coffee maker with such requirements i could not recommend to most people or rate very high sorry for the 2 stars i am sure this brewer may work for some people though just a smaller group of people than you 'd think either that or mine just doesnt work
i purchased this unit a few weeks ago and it 's been trouble ever since i think i managed to get one decent cup of coffee out of it but not as good as my old fashioned percolator i read all of the instructions i read the tips especially regarding using a coarse grind but 90 of the times i used this the coffee would stay in the top vessel for hours of course with the great vacuum created there was no way to separate the two pieces until the pressure equalized leaving a unstable vacuum inside cheap thin glass a disaster waiting to happen well it finally happened after attempting yet again to get a cup of coffe out of this thing using the coarsest grind i could find the liquid again remained stuck '' in the upper vessel so i left it to cool thinking it would eventually equalize on its own after about hours all but about of the liquid had moved to the bottom vessel since i had already used my electric drip machine to get my morning coffe and i did not want to be late for work i decided to go about my morning rituals while in the shower i heard a loud noise from the kitchen upon entering the kitchen i was horrified to see coffee and glass everywhere coffe dripping from the range hood splattered on walls ceiling cabinets and appliances over 5 feet away and glass shrapnel in other rooms over 8 feet away i can only be thankful nobody was in the room when this happened since not evan i could believe what i was looking at while i was actually looking at it i decided to take a few pictures i will be making these available for all to see in the near future i will attempt to include a link in a future review so now i have to spend most of the day missing work cleaning this abominable mess oh by the way coffee stains so i 'll probalby have to the kitchen if you buy this product i would highly recommend the following accessories 1 a good hmo just in case 2 safety goggles as a minimum precaution 3 a frequent flyer '' card from your favorite local coffee house where you should be able to get a decent cup
description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement more like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers made in china of only 74 down to state that this comforter has a retail price of 160 is laughable ! really more of a throw than a comforter at 50 it is grossly overpriced ! look elsewhere
linens and things had better towels ! ! ! ! ! at 5 dollars you pay 9 to 13 dollars at amazon then pay more to ship to you ! ! ! please do not buy this or other branded towels buyer beware amazon please cease and desist ! ! ! sell good items and stop robbing your customers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
thick towels but shed even after washing do n't wash with anything else but other towels seem to have good color saturation nothing special but better than most discount store brands i 'd probably pay a little more for better quality next time
i prefer my spoons to stand upright many of my spoons fall out of this one i guess it depends on your shape of the spoon
it is really not practical especially when you are cooking on all four burners of your stove since there is only one small hole to put your spoons in if you put it on the stove it be careful because it gets hot by the vent on the oven
sheets and comforter are cute my son loves them but they are paper thin you can see right through the sheets and they are a little rough so far my son has n't complained but i do not expect the sheets to last too long
i have to start by saying that this is a review for the sheets only not the whole set but since no one else has yet to review the whole set i felt compelled to educate buyers on at least half of what they were purchasing o i bought this sheet set for my toddler because they look so adorable and they are they 're vibrant but when i first openened the package i was disappointed to feel how uncomfortable they were naturally i hoped that they would soften up after a few washes but after 5 washes they still felt rough and to add insult to injury the elastic edge on the bottom sheet started to unravel and create a 4 inch hole i 'm no expert on thread count when it comes to sheets but i would guess that these are around 100. the weave is so loose that you can see through the sheets and it reminds me of gauze it 's a shame that they are of such poor quality i really do love the pattern i ended up just making curtains out of mine although not advertised in the description here the tag on my sheets say dan river and i noticed that this company produces a lot of the cute sheets for star wars so i 'd say that there is a good chance that many of the dan river sheets are made with the same quality although i do n't know for sure
i just received mine and they look like oneida seconds the edges were poorly finished for oneida though no snags or obvious rough unfinished patches and quite a few have an off centered oneida stamp on the plus side they are solid and attractively designed they 're a decent value at amazon 's prices and acceptable for everyday use
i suppose i should have read the above review but i washed the flatware in the dishwasher as soon as i received it after just a single wash the knives as well as some of the other pieces had developed pitted rust spots i was aware that i had hard water in my new apartment but i did n't think it would effect the flatware after only a single and i 'd never had a problem with the mishmash of flatware that i was attempting to replace with this set if i had been able to wash the flatware without ruining it i would have been very impressed by the pieces they 're sturdy and large unforunately i had to return it
i got this on sale and thought it was a good deal it was n't the pieces are heavy and huge the tines on the forks are sharp i wanted to return the set but the cost of the return shipping was almost as much as the price i paid so i kept it i do not recommend it
when i washed this flatware in my dishwasher some of the knives and forks seemed like they were rusting or the silver on the flatware was coming off i called oneida and they are willing to replace the pieces that are a problem but the same thing keeps happening oneida said that if you have hard water where you live then this can happen i had an oneida set prior to this one that i had for 8 years and this never happened i would not recommend this flatware to anyone the more they get washed in the dishwasher the more it starts to rust very disappointed and surprised in the poor quality of this flatware
in my opinion well i just wanted a tea kettle for my country kitchen and i own some original franciscan hand decorated plates for 23.99 i was n't expecting an antique and this certainly is n't but the decorations on ceramic were acceptable but the tea kettle has design flaws when it comes to whistling the whistle does have a low mellow sound only when you blow into it ! but it rarely works unless you fill the pot to the top and turn up the heat which is not what they advise you to do the problem is the fit of the spout cover to the kettle the whistle being in the cover also the water fill cover fits too sloppily and allows excess steam to escape the amount of steam that escapes from the spout cover and from the water fill cap could scald you i returned mine
warning do not buy this waffle maker i trusted the positive reviews posted here for it and bought one what a mistake ! even on the darkest setting 5 the waffles come out limp as a noodle and with the insides of the waffles tasting like warmed but raw batter ! if your idea of a good waffle is raw batter you will love this machine now i get to it and mail it back is n't that always fun the people who have given this a positive review here need their heads examined ! do n't be deceived by them like i was believe me save yourself the expense and the aggravation and do not buy this piece of garbage !
i bought this waffle iron new and have had horrible results i varied the temperature setting and recipe numerous times but every waffle stuck to the iron and was a disaster i hate this model and would not recommend it mine is on its way to the trash can
the folks in my family like this little gadget and manage to get nice fluffy parmesan out of it but my daughter and i are and find it very awkward to turn the crank i wish you could screw it together both ways for lefties and righties also i think it would be much more durable and work better when the cheese block gets small if it was made of metal parts instead of plastic
despite the description this stainless steel '' grater is plastic with a stainless barrel from the description i thought that the entire unit was stainless although the exterior is a plastic it is plastic nonetheless not too much different than the cheapo version that i already own
the can opener does n't it just turns and turns and hardly goes around the can at all i had paid 19.99 for the set and it was n't worth that
i bought one of these a year or so ago and now it sits idle on my counter it started producing results after about 9 months i have tried many of the grind n ' brew products and none have lived up to the hype or price after spending a week in london i found that most coffee shops use a bialetti type brewing system i bought one and my morning coffee is strong flavorful and brewed right with little or no clean up or prep anyone want to buy my used cuisinart
the is for you if you literally have nothing else to do but make coffee and you enjoy getting dirty if you are a negative person and you need something to get you off on the right foot so you can feel miserable all day the is for you if it were not for the fact that it is cheaply made and it would be a fine coffee maker for people who do not mind taking 20 minutes out of their morning to clean that 's right you have to dismantle it and clean it every time you use it their coffee maker before getting a cup of coffee however on top of being poorly engineered it is poorly built maybe that 's an i ca n't wait for mine to break it comes dangerously close everytime i need to interact with it oh and as an aside it makes crappy coffee the place you put the beans is so small you 'd better plan on using espresso roast if you want to taste coffee
grind and brew maker very disappointing ! coffee never hot enough too many grounds lost in sink drain during clean up cleaning up this pot is many parts
after 3 months of use the basket does not close properly i take careful precaution to make sure the basket and caraffe are properly in place but three times i have woken up to coffee and grinds spilled out all over my kitchen counter and floor because sometime during the grinding session the basket was wiggled loose and opened not only that it is a mess to clean as you have to take off about 6 parts and clean them extensively especially the grinder even when you do n't use it you have to clean it because it fills up with condensation never again will i buy a maker it 's better to grind your own and just fill it with grounds trust me it 's not worth the dissappointment and frustration of waking up with a huge mess to clean and no coffee to drink
for a cookware i bought the wok and a sauce pan because they looked so beautiful on display nothing wrong with the interior it works like should but whoever thought of putting an anodized exterior ought to be made to wash these dishes for eternity hot oil mars the lovely black surface you ca n't put it in a dishwasher i tried and it gives the anodized surface a chalky appearance as it is aluminum my pans look like they have been used in mess kitchens in war zones a complete waste of
i 've had my electric skillet for approximately 2 years i love the way that it cooks and has easy cleanup i had only used it a maximum of 7 times when i noticed that there was a spot that seemed to be stuck on the surface of the pan i looked more closely and discovered that there was about a 2 '' square area where the nonstick coating had just rubbed off i have always been very careful with the way i handle this skillet no metal utensils hand wash no excessive heat i bought it at a really good sale price but i think that i should have been able to get more than 7 uses before it destroyed the cooking surface
i do n't know who else bought this but i ca n't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get into the bed before we turned the thing on it fried then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when i returned the item they did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase always test a product before you risk it on your self or others
i purchased this product and much to my amazement the dual controls are installed backwards ! the control with the service label information is supposed to operate the right side of the bed the unlabeled control is supposed to operate the left side of the bed not so my side of the bed was too hot hubby 's side was too cold when we swapped the controls to the opposite of what the directions said we had the desired results i purchased this product during the winter months and needed it too much to send it back to the factory my expense repair or replacement make sure any electric blanket or warming pad you purchase has at least a 5 year guaranty
i had an old krumkake cast iron that our hinges finally broke off and thought i would try this unit very disappointing ! ever cooked with aluminum foil in the oven within seconds from removing it from the hot oven you can touch the aluminum right i found this cast aluminum krumkake iron to be the same way i could n't control the heat i constantly had to adjust the heat on my stove how frustrating is that i then purchased an electric unit thinking that was the way to go neat concept or so i thought you can cook twice as fast and two at a time to boot however i could n't control the thickness if you do n't mind the bits of teflon we called them black spec surprises '' and a cookie that is twice the thickness of an ice cream cone the electric unit is definitely for you !
take it from a norwegian avoid this product at all costs if you are seeking a real krumkake iron it is not a solid cast iron device look elsewhere for quality
looks nice this is plastic did not last even for 2 months we use very light items like cookies etc to move around
my bought this popper for my two small children for valentine 's day what a piece of junk ! my kids were so excited about it since popcorn is their favorite snack half a jar of orville redenbacher 's kernels and 30 minutes later it managed to pop enough to fill 2 bags i 'd also like to warn you that it spits out hot unpopped kernels my 2 year old picked one up before i could get to it and burned her finger i wish i could throw this thing away since it takes up so much space to store but i 'm sure my will look for it on her next visit
this is the worst popcorn popper i have ever owned ! it is slow and does n't pop well i thought it may have been the popcorn seeds so i bought some new ones and tried again same thing ! what a disappointment ! 20 minutes of popping to get less than 15 half popped burnt pieces in the same timeframe i was able to take out my old 10.00 popper walmart special and pop 3 large bowls melt the butter and disperse to the 15 teengers waiting in movieroom what a waste of money
i really like air popped corn and have a popper both at work and at home however when i bought this popper i was amazed at how many kernels went unpopped the corn that was popped was somewhat burned both of these happened because of the design or the popper i also agreed that it rather large to store i returned the popper after trying it twice because i was so unhappy with how it did its job
i have used my movietime popcorn popper and well i wish i could send it back first the instruction manul claims that it pops more kernels that other popcorn makers if this is true i 'm going back to microwave popcorn i found nearly half the kernels went unpopped q would i reccomend this produt to someone a no !
i see now that it 's rated to 250 degrees though that 's not written on the package the first time i used it the handle got a little too close to the flame of my stove and the end melted it was still serviceable so i was more careful the next time but apparently the cooking temperature of an omelette in a pan is higher than 250 degrees and the entire leading edge melted to my omelette and my pan my very expensive pan entirely ruining my omelette and of course the oxo good grip turner it may have a good grip but it 's not good for much else
i 've used gas wine preservers for many years with good results in my opinion it 's the best way to preserve an opened bottle of reserve is a good product except that the last can i bought had only 22 two second bursts in it they advertise 120 uses and 600 seperate sprays i do n't know if someone tampered with only this bottle or whether it 's the norm but beware that you may run out of the gas sooner than later
the quality of this isnt the sound of the waterproof '' material is loud i dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily i would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality
these items worked for about 4 times each the plastic insert on the top that the metal lever rocks on to seal or unseal the stopper broke on both stoppers the metal on the lever actually cuts into the plactic insert when you push it down to seal the bottle cutting the plastic insert in half when the plactic insert breaks you can not seal the bottle do n't waste you money this product needs to be
these cheap plastic pieces of junk are not worth anything avoid them at all cost
i rarely write reviews but this product was really awful flimsy and the levers broke off on first use the plastic ones i bought at a few years ago were much better but i could n't find them anymore so i thought i 'd try these i 'd give them a negative star rating if i could do not waste your money
completely useless bad design and very bad quality broke on the first use have used similar ones for 6 years and never had one broken before got these cause they looked polished and good well bad idea
i ordered 5 sets 10 savers within one week 6 of them have fallen apart do n't bother junk
se rompio la primera vez que lo use no gasten su dinero en esto
i 'm delighted with the functionality of this product while doing an excellent job in bottles with openings that correspond to the stopper 's measurements it is however too narrow for bottles with larger openings a major shortcoming i found is that the black plastic material on the top of the stopper tends to break when closing the lock without the top material the expansion effect of the stopper is decreased and becomes unsusable of the four stoppers i purchased only one is still unbroken
both of these broke one after another the first time i tried to use them on a regular sized wine bottle buy the zyliss ones instead 4 for 7.99 zyliss ones are great
i was told by the manufacturer that they could not send me this screen aad so have not received any splatter screen
i bought a different model of shark vacuum cleaner about three months ago at a target store near my home it 's a different model than the ones sold on amazon but after reading the reviews here from customers who have purchased different models the results are the same shark vacuum cleaners die out after a few months and even when they work for a few short months they are so high maintenance it 's not worth it stick with eureka hoover or another trusted brand the only thing going for shark vacs is that they look good
wish i had read some of the reviews before i bought they are right what a piece of junk ! ! ! ! the unit does get quite hot after very little use and blows hot air all the while the hose is awkward and there are no small attachments to allow you to get into small spaces very loud too shoulder strap is useless since you have to get on your hands and knees to use the vac or the hose filter is a pain to clean every time who needs the bother and mess and the dirt cup holds very little do n't waste your money
this is an piece of junk it does not have much suction and does not hold but a thimbleful of debris
honestly i tried to find something good to say about this vacumn cleaner alas i could not find a big enough positive that would offset all the predominant minus is the heat factor this unit gets way too hot ! as with any size motor overheating will drastically reduce the motor life the hepa filter may be a good thing but the constant cleaning of it is time consuming and is cheaply made definitely not built to last very long i could say more but i believe the overheating aspect should convince most folks not to waste their time or money on this unit
this product had adequate suction while it lasted which was about 4 months one day it just stopped working i can only assume that the motor died
all i wanted was to have an vacuum for my studio apartment so i got this one for it 's cheap and good for bare floor yet it died off at the first time i used tried to use it it was on just for 20 mins not continuously though i had already emptied the bag for two times and my back was virtually broken when i used it anyway if anyone from the is reading the reviews on this product they should recompensate all of us because i believe marketing such a product is kind of abusing customers ! do n't waste your money on this product
i got this vacuum as a present and could n't believe how strong it was and how well it worked i loved it ! then halfway through the very first time i used it it just stopped working i let it cool down and cleaned out the filter but it never worked again i read that the filter has to be cleaned often but i refuse to stop halfway between a light job to clean out my vacuum
i echo the former review the filter becomes clogged almost immediately and the motor starts to overheat i do n't know what this thing is meant to suck up but it sure is useless on hair and small particles dust cat litter sawdust it was a waste of money and i should have returned it right away
if i had the option of zero stars i would have put that it says to clean often '' and you 'll know why it may filter the smoke as it goes in but it leaves a disgusting smell on the lid i used it one time for one cigarette and put it back in the box the lid smelled so bad it was permeating the room looks cool promising theory with the smoke filtration but an absolute waste of money
shortly after i got this product the thermostat in the max heat option blew out so i can only use the min heat option only 2 options and it will stay on for days no problem this is obviously too bulkly to easily ship back to amazon and i did n't keep the huge cardboard box that covered the manuf box would n't do it again for that reason
although this item is pretty it is very light weight feels cheaply mad
i purchased this heater for my daughter on febuary the heater was connected to a surge protector a week ago my daughter woke up to the smell of something burning the heater had burned out and the outlet in the surge protector was melted
filter is made of the paper and you have to change often otherwise it melts down it is a 6.99 each even if you buy a cheap machine it would turn into expensive machine if you do n't change the filter this machine mists stinky water i use a filtered water however i can smell it also i noticed that when there is no water it does n't stop automatically it will work forever when you do n't stop for example the fan inside rotated more than 24 hours without water i did n't know that after that i often check if there is water inside or not i still have 3 more filters after i use them i will trash it i will not buy it again
be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with mugs small mugs like those that come with dinnerware sets may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms also two of the arms did not screw in properly
this vacuum looks great and promises a lot but it does n't deliver the unit is heavy stiff and awkward to move around applies especially to the wand the powerhead is too big making it hard to maneuver into smaller places the dust cup is rather complicated to detach and empty worst of all is the suction is very little suction unless my unit was defective a possibility considering how crappy the suction was i often had to pass over the same crumb multiple times to get the thing picked up i was so unhappy with this vacuum that i practically gave it away
we got this vacuum as a wedding present and within the first 5 minutes of use it completely died the switch no longer functioned we tried different outlets etc it had not tripped a circuit and the plug was firmly in the wall the two solutions '' sanyo suggests so the problem had to be with the vacuum itself the nearest sanyo service center was over 20 miles from our house and we do n't have a car so getting it repaired is a total hassle do n't expect any sympathy from sanyo on this one there are a lot of other reviewers here who have had the same problem so take our advice and do n't buy this piece of crap
i 've had very bad experience with this vacuum it is bulky heavy and inconvenient also the cord is too short if used in a big house carrying it up and down stairs forget about it ! after all these trouble the engine got fried then the interesting part started i contacted sanyo for warranty work they referred me to some service center which was out of business after going back and forth they accepted their mistake and pointed me to some other place which is very far from me and i am in chicago area ! so there is 1 service center to serve 12 million people do n't buy it ! horrible product plus no service
i 've owned this vacuum for 3 years most features are ok for 150 vacuum cleaner my issues are the unit due to its wheel design gets tougher to pull around on carpet i tip the unit over often due to this also like another reviewer said if you 've got wood floors or tile the absence of an attachment for that type of flooring is missed the powerhead in the off '' position is not the same lastly the powerhead stopped working after just 3 years of light duty we have a 2 story house and have a vacuum on each floor so it only has to vacuum a house like another reviewer the nearest sanyo repair center is 1 hours away the unit only carries a 1 year warranty so i 'm outta luck they sent me to a website to buy a replacement powerhead it 's 130 as much as buying the whole vacuum as in most areas the hourly charge on fixing electronics continues to go up so if it takes a couple of hours at or higher in some areas i 'm sure i may as well buy a new vacuum good points are the way you empty the unit the filter system and it seems to do ok on carpets
this unit is heavy and awkward three months after i purchased it the switch stopped working sanyo 's nearest service location is more than one hour from where i live i called their customer service center and they refused to show any flexibility regarding service ie they would not pay for me to ship it to a repair center nor would they authorize repairs at a nearby appliance repair center the customer service representative was unsympathetic and refused to offer to allow me to speak with her supervisor avoid purchase of sanyo vacuum cleaners to avoid similar problems
assuming that you put the four double a batteries in the right way the unit will start to make a humming sound but as far as being beneficial in keeping an aquarium clean i see no value whatsoever it is a total waste of money the unit simply does n't have enough suction power to be helpful
i have never really reviewed '' an item but always read so here 's my donation no even grinding in either mill one holds salt the other pepper without lots of fussing with the screw nob at the top to adjust the opening some peppercorns come out broken in half while others are appropriately ground '' peppercorns get caught in the grinding mechanism in the case of the salt mill again uneven grinding it may be because the sea salt i have in there seems a bit more moist than bone dry my chief complaint is that when you use the mill you need to adjust the screw on top with every movement thus you get what i mentioned the case of the uneven grind !
for the last six months i 've loved this it did it all unfortunately it 's now off by 75 degrees i 'll be sending it back on warranty but regardless pretty poor quality if it ca n't survive a year of basic kitchen use
the thermometer looks really good at first great range for candy making unlike one of the more inexpensive models that amazon sells and reasonable wire length for the past two months its been great then it suddenly gave poor measurements based on salt free ice water fully equilibrated and salt free boiling water it is approx 25 degrees below what it should read so i 'm sending it back the unit comes with a 5 year warranty we 'll see what type of response i get
when i was incubating yoghurt and or monitoring the temperature of some beer the thermometer works fine of course this is for temperatures below 140 degrees fahrenheit when i tried to use the thermometer for making beer it finally gave out having not used it in a few days it currently reads 160 degrees it 's busted and i 've only had it since january some liquid was spilled on it and the thing completely died ultimately the battery was replaced and the device was left to dry it managed to recover from that but it made me nervous maybe i 'm expecting too much from digital thermometers but i would expect it could handling boiling water i was using the probe to monitor some mash i was preparing for beer that is what ultimately killed it this thermometer also advertises that it can handle candymaking this might be true but i do n't consider fudge that tastes like carbon to be candy '' it just lags too much for candymaking and it did n't accurately display the temperature of the warm sweet liquid since the probe could n't be kept completely imersed while i stirred i have to dig up the warranty and see if there 's anything that can be done about this probe i 'm assuming i 'm out of luck i 'd recommend looking into a more robust thermometer if you can find one
i received this blender for last year it has some nice design features good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender does n't do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months
this item arrived broken not surprising since the bars appear to have been attached with a hot glue gun not recommended
i decided to try this one when my melitta mill n ' brew finally died and figured that for the two hundred dollar price tag it was probably good bad decision on my part pros looks great coffee is really hot unlike some coffeemakers and their lukewarm coffee quieter than most when grinding customer service is exceptional cons the grind seems to have one setting coarse i am a home coffee roaster and the beans i buy and roast call for a finer grind i tried doing a grind and putting back in to regrind but this did nothing except clog up the thing and make a mess the strong '' setting makes much weaker coffee than we are used to also for a two hundred dollar unit it is very cheaply made be very careful with the pouring spout very poorly constructed mess after a week of frustration with this thing i put it away and went and bought another melitta the 60 dollar melitta is a much better value
i ordered king size the label says king but the sheets are queen size ! plus there are light blue ink spots splattered on them ! i would n't have ordered them if i had known because they 're not worth the price this is misrepresentation false advertising not happy with these
they are supposed to be king size but when i tried to place them on my bed i realized that they were queen size instead the hassle of returning is not worth it to me the quality seems okay i love sateen sheets but the size mistake is the reason for my low rating
ordered king size but received queen size the hassle of returning is n't worth it since i am disabled and live in a rural area
this does not work the screw goes through the cork and into the bottle and does not pull the cork out of the bottle i have had several people try it and they have had the same result stick to a good manual rabbit cork screw opener
after reading all the reviews i was eager to own one of these it did n't work at all with synthetic corks and even failed with some real corks ! 8 bottels of wine it has failed on 6 synthetic and 1 real cork i guess you just ca n't beat the waiter 's cork screw
i suppose it 's my own fault but i too am disappointed to find that this item is not as versatile as i had thought it 's not to be used on the range microwave or oven oven for tea only i researched the product on le creuset 's site first but did n't pick up on the fact that their statement concerning suitability for use on stovetops was for their cast iron products not stoneware again my own fault but it would have been helpful to have this info stated explicitly in the product description section and how happy am i that i paid extra to have it expedited that aside it is a very attractive red looks good on the table and does not get too hot to handle out of the microwave
i have ordered several le creuset items and have always been happy with my purchase not so with this teapot i can not use it on my stovetop according to the warnings posted on the packaging
i bought 4 of these springform pans to make cheesecake for of them started to peel and i had to toss them
does n't even come close to working with loose tea your money ! in short garbage at any price ! ! ! !
i dont like reviewing products usless i own them but as a betta hobbiest and prepping to be a breeder and freshwater tank hobbiest this is awful ! it first caught my eye because i thought it was cute but it has many drawbacks the decor in much too large for any fish the tank in much too small for any fish bettas fins are delicate and will clamp or tear they need soft surroundings like fabric or natural decor bettas need a minimum of 1 gallon of water but perfer minimum 5 gallons goldfish need minimum of 5 gallons but are community fish so get at least a ten g and 3 fish most tropicals require 70 gal but you can get away with 40 gal although they require air to survive and can not handle much water movement an adjustable filter i love penguin 's bio wheel ! add a uv filter and a small air block for thin bubbles to remove ickies bad bacteria and viriouses remember bettas jump ! you do n't want to have to go on treasure hunt for your dried crispy friend ! i use a 20 gal community tank fish carefully sellect ! some will go after the beautiful fins of of the betta and males should never go in with other bettas try living and wasting in the smallest cubicle though betta probebly will not live that long
this is too small of a tank for a betta especially two bettas are fish that can be healthy and entertaining but not in these tiny cells how would you like to spend your life in an elevator you would survive but you would be miserable you should provide a betta with at least 2 gallons plus
my son received a beta as a gift and when we went to the store to buy an aquarium the clerk recommended this tank and also recommended getting a second beta to add in hindsight he was n't looking out for our fish but for his profit even though betas can live in small spaces i would not recommend it even for one beta this tank is too small it gets dirty easily and needs to be cleaned once a week which is an immense stress on the fish the fake plants provided with the tank do n't help with the water quality either for now we moved our beta to a large glass baking bowl and we are in the process of shopping for a larger tank with an undergravel filter and live plants plus a heater i absolutely agree with the other review if you ca n't afford a good tank for your fish do n't get one betas like space too
everything negative that is in all the other writen ratings are very true i had this coffeemaker for 3 months and impressive to look at but horrible to use and died on me in 3 months of home use i am a homemaker and a die hard coffee drinker 12 to 20 cups a day this pot could n't stand up to making 3 pots of coffee a day it did not brew or keep the coffee hot enough and took much to long to warm up and brew a pot do not purchase this coffee maker ! you will be sorry i do n't know how to return it as i threw out the box two months ago and purchased it online while stationed overseas yesterday i purchased two of the new model cuisanart 12 cup programmable makers i can now brew two pots at the same time and much faster the cuisanart pots let me regulate the coffee carafe temperatures and brew a great cup of coffee are self cleaning auto shut off hours you choose an to let you know when the pot is finished brewing and are half the price i purchased two for the price of one waring coffee maker i will never purchase another waring product
i was looking for a coffee maker for use in my home i am hard on appliances i loved the idea of high durability 2 warmers and quick brewing this machine is meant to be left on all the time always keeping the water hot and ready to brew while perfect for an office or classroom setting where one pot is made after the other all day or for extended periods most home users do n't really benefit from this leaving it on all the time is an energy drain you can turn the unit off when you are done with it but the next time you turn it on you need to wait 13 minutes for it to warm up and then 4 to brew ! and if you only brew one or two pots per day you are always using the old water left in the machine for your coffee the machine actually holds two and a half pots of water which is confusing if you ever have guests that are trying to make a simple pot of coffee in the morning if you ever want to empty the unit of it 's water good luck finally the additional warmer is on the back of the unit not the front so you can forget using it if you keep this machine on your counter under a cabinet this is not a traditional coffee maker for most home users i suggest trying to read the product manual before deciding if this is the right maker for you
i never received the large bowls the small cereal bowls were sent twice quickly but wrong size both times and i returned both orders i was sent an stating something significant was wrong with the system and i would not be receiving the larger bowls then i got an saying i was being billed for them to which i replied what i received was not what i ordered and had been returned twice i have all the paperwork on both orders the plates i ordered were never received at all i have no idea what is going on now it makes sense that i be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that is n't happening eithe
i thought i did enough research before buying this machine but apparently not enough i was disappointed in 1. the design looks rather cheap and 2. the performance the coffee maker did n't stop dripping either water or coffee when you pulled out the pot and for the espresso part you need to reheat the unit 30 minutes prior to use ! ! ! so much about being flexible about having an espresso ! if you really enjoy good coffee you need to invest more unfortunately
it started out great then the step mechanism broke after two months not worth the money
though this item may be a piece of junk i just wanted to clarify something for everyone steel will always rust even the stainless '' steels however it is more resistant to rusting so long as you care for the item for example dont leave in a the sink for too long dont leave it outside in the rain or a puddle of water because it will rust
this shaker is a piece of garbage for starters the shipper sends it to you in the retail box with no padding if that does n't ensure that the shaker will be bent when it gets to you you 'll wish that it was because the shaker is worthless the 'stainless ' steel is rusting after only 2 months and the shaker top is infuriatingly impossible to remove because it sits inside the 24 oz resevoir i 'm getting the ultimo and sending this one to the chinese junk heap where it belongs better yet back to the seller for a refund on the 'lifetime warranty'
i bought this coffeemaker as replacement for my starbucks model that i accidentaly damaged unit stop working after a month quality and taste of coffee could not compare with my starbucks machine which unfortunately is discontinued i am not sure who built coffe maker for them now they sell kitchen aid and delonghi i took my coffeemaker to local authorized repair shop they told me that this is nonrepairable model and that i will receive replacement in 4 weeks i even had to pay 12.50 for shipping its been more than 8 weeks delonghi customer service will not deal with customer and repair shop told me they are out of stock and there is nothing thay can do about it most of electronics stores have 30 days policy and if your unit fail within this period return it and buy something else i did not do my homework since i did not consider coffemaker purchase to be major one but after reading horrible reviews about this product i would like to warn future customer of making same mistake
the clock lost time from the minute i plugged it in it progressively lost minutes everyday when it was 30 minutes slow i sent it back and received a new one that also lost time immediately after being plugged in i waited a week and it was now 45 minutes slow contacted delonghi directly and they offered to send me the same model but a different serial number that one also lost time contacted delonghi again they then replaced the unit with a different model this one the water does not drip through the grinds they are now sending us a new basket to hopefully solve the problem well we received the new basket unit and the water with coffee still does not drip through contacted delonghi and was asked to cut the cord and send it in and they would sent another replacement unit in 3 to 6 weeks this will be our unit we aksed for a refund but were told they can not do that ! ! ! ! ! ! meanwhile we have purchased a unit through gevalia and will keep getting replacements til they get it right ! ! ! ! ! ! this will be our received a new unit on and yet again the water failed to drip through the filter contacted delonghi was told we were n't positionung the carafe correctly i am not a harvard graduate however i do kn ow how to place a carafe into the unit they said they will send out yet another basket unit we received the basket and still the same problem i finally contacted amazon and pled my case to them so much for dealing with the manufacturer directly they authorized a return even though this unit is a replacement for the original defective one i know who reads this must be tired by now and has given up as have i
this brand was my delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months after the first one broke after 5 weeks this one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning i came in and found coffee all over the counter i thought i had not aligned the pot properly or something after another week of dealing with this the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills this coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day i do n't know what happened and we could n't get it resolved we purchased a cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty not the one that grinds coffee and has worked great for 6 weeks
no stars is what this should be where do i start the machine brews the coffee everywhere but into the caraffe you will have coffee grinds and water all over your counter if you do n't position the caraffe in the exact spot it needs to be so forget setting the timer for the or you will be needing your mop the so called thermal caraffe is junk plan on a refill 15 minutes after your first cup you 'll have to nuke it as the thermal caraffe does not keep coffee warm at all you know those little holes that the coffee pours into during brewing i think it lets the heat out as well this is the worst coffee machine i have ever owned and it is the most expensive one i have ever owned i 'm going back to the nine ninety nine specials at least they work
this is by far the worst product i have ever purchased i hate this coffee maker i paid 79 for this item and i want to smash it with a hammer i 'm not a violent person but when coffee floods your counter you want to crush it the only way to safely make a pot of coffee is to place it in the sink for fear of flooding even with the lid perfectly clean and on properly it leaks coffee between the carafe and the lid to boot pouring water into the reservoir is a chore no matter how careful you are you will have coffee on the counter like another reviewer the clock does not keep time you need to reset it on a regular basis for the first 30 days or so i actually liked the thing but as you can tell my opinion has definitely changed good luck to you if you buy this product
absolutely love the design am heartsick that my first unit and the replacement both quit working after about weeks local service not existent amazon replacement policy super but basic design problem methinks water flows all over occasionally and pc board stops working when wet with coffee just wish unit would work and or service center would be avail unit probably should be recalled ron romansk
right from the start i have had problems with this coffee marker the loses about 5 minutes a day so i 'm always resetting the time to the correct time so that the automatic start feature will work the lid on the thermos leaks during brewing which means coffee spills everywhere including on the maker which also shuts the coffee marker off so i end up with coffee everywhere and have to wait hours before i can even think of using the marker again i have owned the coffee maker for less than 30 days and i think i will be looking for a replacement tomorrow
my fiance and i purchased this item thinking it would make a great addition to our room the pictures looked great as it turns out the product is not as nice the chairs are too shallow not deep enough to be comfortable and leave a large unsightly gap between the seat and bottom swivel portion also the color does not appear to be espresso but rather i would definitely not purchase this product again
i had high hopes for this little gadget being a fan of grilled sandwiches unfortunately one experience was all it took to convince me that this grill is n't the way to go i tried to make two grilled ham and cheese sandwiches within about 30 seconds of the grilling it was pouring cheese out all sides of the grill and no before you wonder i did n't use a lot of cheese i did n't even let it finish the cooking cycle because the cheese was getting underneath the grill and i did n't want it near the cord when i opened the unit i got two sandwiches that needed to be separated from one another and cut into halves using a steak knife and even that was a pain the sandwiches themselves which started as standard bread were now mashed into what looked more like pita bread hollow thin and a little tough the edges were burned black just generally not a good sandwich as opposed to cleaning the liquid cheese off this device just went in the trash i ca n't recommend this even over just a standard griddle
it was ok but not grate i found a better one on e bay and threw this one in the trash it colandered the food ok but did nothing to add excitement to my life the antique one i found on e bay simply turned my life around in the kitchen now i 'm cooking like a dream and gaining lots of weight on the serious side it was a little small and awfully shiny it was a little deep compared to the width it drained the spaghetti ok and i used it for vegetables
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
i do not even rate this one star but the website does not go any lower we used this product only once before we had to throw it in the garbage can it was not very sturdy and bent after normal use would not buy another one
not much to say about this item it sucks very thin and cheap made does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah this is the worst product i have every got from amazon
i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter maybe it works fine who knows the design and manufacture were so poor i did n't keep it long enough to find out
this is the of this type of travel press i have had and all of them seem to have this problem i 've only had the latest one for less than a month and now the seal is broken again i 'm really quite disappointed i expected more from bodum
the rice cooker time takes to lon
this is an ugly looking made in china '' japanese item the finish is not up to the mark go for other models which are made in japan '' for looks and reliability
i have tried to order twice from this company the first time i waited over eight months and cancelled the order i accidently ordered from them a second time but when they mentioned a delay i looked them up do not order from them
consider yourself warned do not buy this set from amazon ! i ordered it on and amazon has since then emailed me every days to inform me that there has been a delay in the product 's arrival in order to keep the order active you have to go to the amazon site and approve the delay this is what i 've been doing for 5 months now ! i 've emailed amazon twice about it and they credited me 5 and still do n't have the product in stock that they are supposedly selling to people save yourself the headache amazon does n't actually have this product buy elsewhere submitted
these containers are a great size and hold exactly what they say they will and save cabinet space unfortunatly my sugar clumped up because of moisture and bugs got into my i 'd suggest snapware
i 've never had a problem with sheets pilling before so this was a first 300 thread count is sort of wasted when there are hard little pills all over the surface also the sheets are very thin
perhaps with such an amazingly low price 30 it was bound to be too good to be true but this item stayed on order for more than a month before i was told it was out of stock
i thought they would be a lot softer and they get so increadibly wrinkled when you wash them i felt like i needed to iron my sheets
you get what you pay for on these and i should have skipped it but i 've gotten some great deals on amazon before however these sheets were a wash ! i ca n't cry too much because they were inexpensive but that 's exactly how they feel thin and cheap i would not recomend these sheets if you like the higher thread count luxury feeling super 8 and motel 6 have better sheets than this ! disappointing
when i read that these sheets were 300 thread count i expected high quality in fact they are seconds on the top sheet a rip had been and not very well the sheets are thin wrinkled and need ironing even out of the package they are also very plain buy something else unless you just need a cheap set for a cottage or someplace you wo n't use them often
the tags on the sheets said to wash before using i did this and when i put them on the bed the bottom is more like a full or queen size the top sheet is also rather small i can not use this product
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
like other customers i too thought i was getting a crate and not a divider the image for this product is extremely deceptive as it shows a crate with no divider i feel that the picture should be removed so the product can be represented accurately
i was confussed by the picture i thought i was getting a 54 '' crate now i have a divider with no crate
i was confused by the pic and now i have this 54 '' divider with no crate to go with it awesome !
i 'm not quite sure if this product could even be described as a thermos it looks like a thermos to be sure it has a lid and appears to be insulated however the lid does not actually form a seal that 's right jostle tip or shake this container and liquid will seep out i 've used it several times hoping the leakage was a fluke caused by poor on my part and each time it 's failed an additional drawback is that since the lid does n't seal the liquid does n't stay hot or even warm so even if you plan to leave it on your counter i would recommend another product altogether however the sleek styling might tempt you
tried making some hard candy and it started to caramelize at the point not good ! i 'm going to buy another thermometer from another company
actually zero stars it does n't give the right temperature it showed 250 when temperature of fat for fried chicken was 350 according to taylor instant read digital thermometer i just threw it in the garbage this is a terrible product shame on oxo for distributing it their products are usually excellent
this thermometer just did n't work i ruined a batch of carmel because the gage would n't rise above 220. i do n't know if i just got a bad '' one but i 'm not going to find out by exchanging it when i return it i 'm getting a different more trusted brand
the oven works perfectly when new actual temperature is exactly as shown on the temperature dial as the oven is used the thermostat distorts temperature is lower and lower and lower actually changing a bit during extended use the oven used twice a week for one hour each time now heats to 300 degrees when set to 350 degrees and temperature drops if the oven is used longer this seems entirely due to use of a cheap thermostat unit that gradually distorts during use and that never returns to original shape thus the unit will require a good oven thermometer to compensate and monitoring at all times an intolerable situation do not buy this the physical design is superb the thermostat 's gradual cumulative inaccuracy makes this unit undependable for most purposes
haier extra large capacity convection oven would be great if the company did a better job puting it together the first one worked for 1.5 weeks then the power went out on it sent for a new one and it came with the door not put together right part of the hinge was missing not happy with this at all will not deal with this company again i bought this as a gift for my mother and she is the one who has had to deal with this mess elizbeth nv
we purchased our first haier 1700 at brandsmart for 137.00 three years ago along with an extended warranty after one year we turned it in for a replacement because the temp was unstable the second one lasted two years before the door broke and the convection fan stopped i love the price and the size it accomodates a size baking pan it 's great for about a year or two at most
perhaps the larger model works well this smaller magnetic set is tragic the only upside is that if you 're working on your grip strength these will probably help to get a useable amount of pepper you 'll have to squeeze times they feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can stick with a tried and true twist grinder
looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge but they 're just eye candy shakers do n't store a lot of salt or pepper handles are too small to comfortably hold and it 's hard to detect any salt and pepper coming out
this set of sheets was a bargain not ! they immediately started to pill '' and are definitely not the size that it says on the package i 'm guessing these sheets are probably from the back of the reject '' pile ! i would send them back but it would n't be worth the cost of shipping believe it when they tell you you get what you pay
if you are after the egg rings forget it your eggs leave their edges in the rings as for the bacon press good grief how can you mess up a flat piece of iron with a handle
i have been using this product for a few weeks now it is very comfortable and provides a great base for the laptop the problem it is too hot this is only marginally better than having no venting at all i have another type of lap desk without the padding and it keeps my lap top very cool so you have a choice to make comfort or cooling this product does not provide bot
i own a lapworks laptop desk which i loved until the little rubber bumbers lost their stickiness and my laptop started sliding after a false start with antother type of laptop desk i ordered a lapinator fantastic customer service lightning fast shipping and i thought i was in love the lapinator is and comfortable even though it 's tilt angle is not adjustable i ordered extra rubber bumpers and installed 5 rubber bumpers on the lapinator just to make sure there was enough ventialtion i was using a sony and just bought an i placed the on my old lapworks laptop desk and had the on the lapinator while transferring files at first i was shocked at how much hotter the 's palmrest and mousepad were as compared with the but then realized the problem was the lapinator now that i have the on the lapworks laptop desk it 's much cooler ! i mean much cooler so i 'm back to figuring out how to keep the laptop from sliding on my old lapworks laptop desk or just biting the bullet and buying a new one sorry lapinator you need to change the design punch some holes in it or install some fins or something sure it keeps my lap cool but it causes my laptop to heat up way too much
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous the handle is much too small for this size mug if you can get your finger through the small hole your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware the first and only time my family used these mugs two of us burned ourselves fiestaware really screwed up on this one a shame given the beauty of the scarlet fiestaware
i purchased this wok for my husband 's christmas present it was lovely we cooked two meals in it christmas day nice heat transfer beautiful on the table but big that night he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan it 's considerably narrower than the normal le creuset handle back it went to williams sonoma where there were a few other woks with similar cracks ! phooey to you le creuset i wish i could find another glass lidded joyce chen wok my old one was the best before it was dropped one too many times
this piece of plastic is garbage ! one use and it fell apart just use the end of a cork screw to rip the foil off
the product was not comfortable it is now in the spare bedroom for unwanted guests also perspired even with 2 cotton pillowcases
this pillow is all right but it is a bit too soft it also hardly has any height and with the softness if you sleep on your side you end up sleeping with your neck angled downwards i have woken up with a headache a few times because of this i paired it with another pillow in order to make it higher and little but firmer but it still is n't the best it could be i would pay more and get a higher density pillow of course this type of product is something that depends upon the preferences of the person using it it just did n't work for me as well as i thought it would
great idea it took about a week but after a period of time my cat loved it and now wo n't drink much without it but like so many modern products consumerism runs rampant unless you spend 15 to 30 minutes every two weeks to scrub it clean expect to buy a new one every 6 months to a year mine lasted about 8 months due to being continuously filled with water and cleaned the main issue is poor material selection and saving about a buck on the motor first better quality brushless motors freely available for incorporation into the design would work here but would add about a buck to material costs this shows a design decision to trade quality for more sales due to burned out motors this warrants a recommendation to wait as a better quality competitor will likely soon arise and knock drinkwell off second they made a design decision to use very cheap plastic that gets dirty and stains far too easily a higher quality stain resistant plastic would also add a buck to their product great product but wait for a competitor who will do things right
i 'm sending this back as the pump is very loud louder than my refrigerator when it 's
what happened to the research devolpment team for the cuisinart traditional waffle iron they must be out eating waffles at the notorious waffle lady house of waffles the noise this waffle iron makes when your waffle is done sounds like a smoke alarm going off and oops they forgot a volume control you will burn your hand on the handle if you put in too much batter plan on the batter going in to the many cracks and crevices the design team thought they would add just for annoynance sake the waffles we made turned out flatter than any pancake we 'd ever made boo hiss come on cuisinart you can do better than this
the first waffle came out ok but on our second try the lid mechanism locked with the waffle inside we tried everything to get the waffler open but had to send it back trapped waffle and all
poor quality of wood poor quality of workmanship evidently these foreign makers do n't have any idea what sandpaper is very surprised henckels would allow their name to be put on this item ! ! ! would rate it less than one star if possible ! !
i purchased this fan less than 60 days ago in a different color and from a different source i was very pleased with it until it suddenly started dripping black oil from the motor since we leave it on while we sleep i find this scary
i have been using a marineland 280 for over a year now and each month it is a horrible chore to clean the thing in addition it 's noisy sure it filters okay but i got so tired of having to clean the thing i decided just for convenience try a much less expensive and less powerful filter i got a whisper i was shocked that the whisper works a lot better than this 280 and churns out a lot more power with truly whisper quality noise easy to maintain too i put my marineland 280 in the shack and will probably throw it away the marineland 280 is a pain to start try getting it run without that whirr whirr whirr like it 's in pain to a steady flow takes about 5 to 7 minutes with constant throwing water in the container the whisper only took 10 seconds with the container even just half full of water so what 's the deal with this 280 as far as i 'm concerned it 's a waste of money the biowheel is also terrible sure bacteria grows on it but take it out of the water for a few minutes say goodbye to your colony
i was very disappointed with this teaball it is not readily apparent from the picture but this product is actually shaped like a small cylinder high with a diameter the cylinder twists apart in the middle to open the problem is that first of all it is not tall enough to grasp firmly and has no 'handle ' points and second the actual locking mechanism is simply based on a push and twist design but the metal parts do not fit together properly and are very hard to twist wrenching the teaball seems a good way to get tea all over the floor in fact this first day i received the teaball i practiced opening it several times and eventually it became stuck i was unable to open it until the next morning even if my particular product was somehow bent i can not see how this mechanism could hold up to repeated use hopefully amazon will have another teaball soon
hi this product did not mention about the non stick interior surface it just said hard anodised this product when delivered to our house did not have the original calphalon packaging it was packed in a white box with one shabby calphalon booklet inside it was hard to tell if the product was new or used all n all a bad buy
much smaller and lighter than i expected i own a set of calphalon and all pieces are very heavy it 's like another reviewer indicated its not hard anodized price was right and probably not work sending back i 'll decide whether to keep or
i have an oxo spoon i bought a couple of years back it 's a heavy spoon but when i recently went to buy more as gifts i discovered oxo has since thrown quality out the window their spoons are now made of several pieces of wood glued together just like so many other cheap wooden spoons for sale nowadays which usually crack after a few uses if this is what you want just go to your local discount store but if quality if what you 're after you 'll have to look elsewhere
as a serious amateur woodworker who has also studied the design and building of wooden boats let me say that beechwood is by far one of the inferior materials one could choose for making wooden spoons olivewood is by far the superior material for this sort of common yet critical kitchen tool should you doubt this please visit the kitchens of france italy and spain to see what 's stirring the pot additionally fabricating the spoon by gluing multiple pieces together is a lesson in engineering failure it violates the most basic principles of woodworking wood because it is made by nature and not man is not uniform wood not only expands and contracts as it heats and cools but also as it draws up moisture and dries multiple pieces equals multiple rates of expanding and contracting working against the glued joint while oxo makes and sells some very fine kitchen tools i have a vegetable peeler by them that 's the best i 've ever owned and it 's about a decade old this is sure not among them a product to avoid
bought two spoons and within 2 months both had split along the glue lines the spoons were hand washed get spoons but i ca n't afford to replace them every two months
we bought this thinking that it would make food prep easier especially french fries and salsa it 's just not doing the trick effectively even my husband has a hard time getting the slicer to push down over a potato it takes a lot of muscle and time which is what it was meant to save delicate foods like tomatoes just get smashed while hard foods are very difficult to push through
this slicer seems easy enough and is easy to clean hard part is you have to press the blade over the food to be sliced potatoes and most foods used with this tool are oval shaped and do not stand up on end without slicing them once you have gotten the slicer over the food you have to press it through the slicer sections manually it is a better idea to get the box style cutter for about the same cost which is easier to use has a shaped press to push the food through the blades and dishwasher safe too ! i wish i had not found this item first
hi i bought this heater at home depot and was very happy initially it did an awesome job at heating my garage it would heat up my 2 car garage from high to high in a couple of hours but i needed something that could work in the garage for 3 to 4 hrs everyday a month after we bought it it broke down would not start up awful not durable at all
i thought this product was a great idea and it does make good popcorn when it is n't busy burning you first off the package has an open window which means it is almost impossible to find an undamaged one at the store i chose the one with the least damage lots of scratches and one dent which i was able to bend back i used it first thing i noticed you have to wear long sleeve and oven mitts because the top is not fitted well enough and lots of oil spatters out then after continued use the top window became loose it fell into the pot while i was cooking the popcorn and popcorn went everywhere and so did burning hot oil i had to turn off the stove and leave the room until it stopped i sustained some oil burn
i bought six of these collars for my five cats i bought an extra just in case one of the cats lost one i thought the colors were great and i was happy with the idea of the material as opposed to cheap vynil they do look fashionable i think and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself however these collars are not breakaway '' collars they enlarge if they get caught on something but this actually only adds its own problems several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar and the collar extended as far as possible i hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something after getting the leg stuck one cat finally did come home without his and i did n't replace it another came home with the collar around her chest both front legs had gone through and it was constricting her i pulled to try to get it off but it was obviously very painful and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off i decided these collars are not very safe after all too bad i bought six at once the reviews at the time were pretty good generally i 've taken them all off and now my daughters can play with them on their stuffed animals they look do look cute ! i just do n't trust them on live animals
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
i agree with the previous reviews the ad is misleading the description said '' what 's in the box featherbed '' i assumed it was an actual feather bed too now i have to find a feather bed to put inside amazon should correct their mistake in the ad and put up a picture of the cover only
i have purchased 3 i thought its feather bed pad something as the description but its end up to be only a cover so its just not good to buy online on amazon '' because you ca n't really expect what you are gon na get please becareful
this blender comes with the battery unit that sits on top of the removable motor which sits on top of the blender shaft this makes the unit entirely too tall to apply the proper pressure and very uncomfortable to maneuver while on the stove or counter i tried using it for whipping up some potatoes and the power proved too weak to do an adequate job sorry cuisinart this is quite a disappointing product
cuisinart 's ad copy and product directions claim that the charger can be kept plugged into the wall so it 's always ready for use however this is a rechargeable battery plugging it back in to recharge before you 've fully drained it is death to nicad batteries ! this stupid design decision on the part of cuisinart almost guarantees a poor user experience
it 's not god awful but the cheaper plug in one i have is easier to use not as heavy and bulky and gets the job done with out running out of steam
i used to love the blender two years ago fast clean up easy set up great for making mayo hollandaise whipped cream soup then into hot water and soap hit the blend and you 're clean but the battery dies and wo n't hold a charge this is forseeable but does cuisinart offer at reasonable cost nooooooooo ! guess what we 'll buy a cheap corded model we 're disappointed every product has some limitations but one should be able to use it for 3 years with no problem and replace parts quickly easily and at a good price if desired this product is just another example of bad business and we do n't want to reward it
my second aeroccino is now not working the first one just completely died and this one will only stay on for a couple of seconds before turning off i believe that nespresso needs to overhaul the whole machine before subjecting the public to it ! ! especially at the price they are charging
the problem of this product is that the mill frother stop if the milk is hot so you need to wait to the aeroccino become cold
when aeroccino works it works great it is quick and quiet and produces excellent foam clean up is very easy but there is something inherently unstable about aeroccino machines since august i managed to kill three of them and i am not sure why part of it is the nature of the machine because it is constructed like a water kettle one should not submerge it into water but because it is designed to heat milk the manufacturer allows putting it under running water as long as the bottom of the machine remains dry if you get the bottom wet and you will the machine either trips and heals itself after fully drying or dies i suspect my first two aeroccinos died such deaths my third one died today i frothed milk with it refilled it and tried again without cleaning in between and the machine did not work i tried again and it worked for 20 seconds and stopped i tried again a couple hours later and it worked for 10 seconds and stopped i am not sure why it is so but i suspect it has to do with the magnetic foaming brushes you must insert into the machine to make it work if anyone has ideas why this is so let me know on the positive side i keep calling the company and they keep sending me new machines i really like aeroccino when it works but i suspect it will be the good old microwave when i finally run out of warranty
a great product but after waiting 2 weeks for amazon to ship i checked they sell a box of 9 bottles for 39.99 4.44 each shipping and handling is free the item is in stock and they ship in business days
i have had these salt shakers for over a year they are terrible it is a fight everytime you want to fill them i am buying new ones
i was overcharged a considerable amount of shipping costs due to misrepresentation of the product weight according to the shipping company and other websites it weighs 10.3 lbs yet i was charged shipping costs for 22.5 lbs ! both this site and the supplier 's site continue to list the weight as 22.5 lbs since both companies are aware of the discrepancy '' it is intentional misrepresentation and i believe many customers are due a considerable refund as if that were n't enough i did n't notice at the time i opened the box that the pot had substantial damage to the rim yet the lid did n't so it appears it was packaged after the damage occurred i had to the dented rim and all of the resulting coating after all the aggravation i just could n't bring myself to send it back and have to communicate with the supplier again ! this must be the worst online purchase i have ever experienced ! if the weight represented is not corrected on both websites i will report it the better business bureau
these sheets are indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old 100 cotton count and very expensive sheets but are much thinner surprisingly suggesting more delicate threads this fact was borne out when less than a month after starting to use them one of my cats kneaded '' on the bed with his claws and the sheet was irreparably shredded this has never happened before with any sheets i have owned in 40 years of multiple cat owning sure i 've gotten thread pulls and tiny little holes in other sheets but not the cuts that appeared with these sheets after just one kneading session it really looked like someone had taken a pair of scissors and stabbed the sheet repeatedly despite the high thread count this cotton is thin and delicate so beware if you are a you do get what you pay for with these inexpensive sheets
i was not pleased to have received a different product than was ! the company did not respond to my request for a return with refund based upon an item that differed from the item ! the item received was a single handled item ! do not order unless you are aware of the fact that the seller may deliver a replacement item
the first time using the product it got jammed and i have not been able to open the machine up due to its malfunction i need to exchange it for a new pasta maker however i do not have any of information to do it it was thrown out by mistake could you please send me information on how to exchange the machine for a new one and then i could be better at rating the product
i 've had this pasta maker for 9 months and used it regularly over that period overall it does what it is supposed to do however there are two major problems first two parts broke for seemingly no reason other than poor design and quality the mixing bowl cracked on my first use and it took at least four months to get a replacement from delonghi recently the housing for the extruder shattered i also lost one small part and had to wait months for a replacement part from delonghi overall it seems like there are too many parts making it overcomplicated to clean and assemble and the parts are of poor quality the second major problem is that the way dough is extruded through the circular feeding tube the pasta easily falls together and sticks you can work hard to keep the individual strands of pasta floured and separated is n't this supposed to be a machine that makes thing easier since buying this machine i have also purchased the kitchenaid stand mixer with the pasta roller and cutter attachments and feel this is just infinitely easier to use and produces much nicer pasta particularly for flat pasta shapes such as fettuccine and spaghetti i also ordered the ravioli shape for the delonghi and it produced sheets that were simply too small to work with the kitchenaid makes nice wide sheets and you can adjust the dough thickness to meet your needs note that the extrusion machines and also the extrusion attachment for the kitchenaid are your only options if you want to make shapes like macaroni
i gave these glasses as a christmas present and found out less than a month later that they broke after a few uses how embarrassing ! go to pier 1 and but them for 2.00 each
the cartridges are exactly as i expected but the shipping charges were hidden no where during my order was i informed of the very high shipping i would not order from there again
if the air outside is hot then the fan blows out hot air ! only if the air is cold will the fan blow cold the fan lies on your chest the air is only blowing on your chin which can be annoying and the breeze is only coming out of five square shaped holes at the top of the machine it 's better than nothing and if you try it and dont like it the sharper image has a 60 day return policy
this product looks much better in the picture than in person the brush looks very full in the picture but actually very sparce in person bristles already started falling out before i even used it it comes unwrapped just thrown in a plastic bag for shipping
as with the reviewer above i purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first the remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well however within 4 months of owning it when we tried to have it rotate it turns slightly gets stuck and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating needless to say it no longer rotates so it is now just a stationary fan i even tried taking it apart to unjam it but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem so without new parts it could not be fixed buy another fan if you want it to last i know i am
i purchased this at wal mart and within 6 months it was broken the plastic is weak and the gismo that turns the frequently get fan gets stuck the final time trying to straighten it caused a crack and the thing is worthless another made in china product gone to the trash
first of all they are rolled up like a sleeping bag when you get them and you have to carefull peel them apart second it takes over a week before they regain their size and thickness third i got a king sized one for our rv and it is a better fit on the rv sofa sleeper it 's at least 12 '' small on all four sides for the king sized bed do n't know how i am ever going to be able to get them packaged back up into the little rolls now to ship them back to get my
i 've been watching this item for a while to buy for my wife i saw the reviews about it stopping and basically not working correctly and figured that this was a pretty serious fault and someone in a factory somewhere would be working on a solution to this so it 's been many months since the last review and i decided what the heck i 'll take the plunge and buy it and we 'll see if they fixed it nope it 's still broken as detailed in the other reviews at times it simply will not go off your best warning is when you stop hearing the ticking i still give it 2 stars though because the wife loves how cute it is she does n't even care that the thing fails to serve it 's primary function i guess if you are looking for a figurine rather than a timer this could be a winner
we 've had this timer for a couple years now maybe a little longer it 's really cute it does ring really loud but lately it 's taken to stopping before it should it just stops ! no ring ! nothing ! we 've known our food is done when we 've smelled things burning ! and it never was very good at timing things for less than 10 minutes it often did the same thing that is just stop without ringing but it was so cute ! we kept it and dealt with it but not anymore nope ! i 'm today looking for a different style chicken timer
i received my timer yesterday and decided to test it it did n't work ! ! ! i shipped it back right away it looked somewhat cute with the chicken and chicks but the quality is not really good not just because it did n't work but just how the plastic looks i would get another kind in a heart beat
save your 12 bucks this timer has a nice look that is why i gave it the 2 stars if your thinking of buying this timer stop buy a different one
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous the handle is much too small for this size mug if you can get your finger through the small hole your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware the first and only time my family used these mugs two of us burned ourselves fiestaware really screwed up on this one a shame given the beauty of the scarlet fiestaware
not bad the three feet on the bottom just makes the whole thing unstable and does not help to stabilize the holder it 's ok for the basement or utility room but if i had to choose again i would n't buy it
this turner was much too soft '' for my taste the neck is bendable to the point that it makes it difficult to use i have several other kitchenaid products which i really like but this one is going to be replaced soon
i have tried 4 times to cook brown rice i feel like goldilocks too crunchy a little crunchy all mush when i increased the amount of water there was a very starchy mess leaking all over my countertop not what i expected at all i have n't tried white rice perhaps that will work but not the reason i purchased this cooker as soon as i locate the receipt it is being returned
for the first two months this rice cooker was just everything i had asked for but after two months the water started to drip from all corners of the rice cooker i first thought i was putting high amounts of or may be the rice is n't good i changed everything and its still working same way before returning it i thought i should try contacting panasonic customer service and guess what was kept on hold for more than 30 minutes and then the customer rep says its the amount of water thats causing the leak i told him that i put 1.5 glasses of water per glass of rice he says i should reduce it to 1 glass of water is absurd should as well eat raw rice i am from asia and therefore rice is our staple food i have had black and decker and salton rice cookers before and never had any problems what so ever only reason for buying this panasonic rice cooker is that my previous rice cookers are not non stick i am going to return this one and buy some thing else i found a similar non stick rice cooker hamilton beach in kohls and i am going to buy it
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
this spoon has a plastic core which is fragile enough that mine arrived already broken in two clean across the neck the handle on the spoon is large and thick perhaps not good for smaller hands but for hands it conforms to either hand nicely the size and thickness of the handle mean you 'll probably need to store it in a drawer or hang it from a utensil rack it would crowd other utensils out of a standing utensil crock the bowl of the spoon holds cup of liquid when full
as other reviewers had pointed out you have to clean this vacuum pretty often the vacuum is not good at handling lint and small particles and i happen to have a lot of those in my apartment what happens is that lint would clog the preliminary filter made of a metallic net and fine dust ends up clogging hepa filter these dirt have no where to go but to stay on the filter which have very small surface area so overall the performance is worse than a bagged vacuum cleaner which at least have a large surface area to trap the dirt the hepa filter is also difficult to clean they claim you can tap '' it but in reality i find myself having to bang it against a hard surface it is the only way to make dirt come off banging it also causes dust to fly all over the place inhaling the fine dust trapped by hepa could be fatal in my case trying to vacuum a 200 sq carpeted room usually takes me 1 hour because i have to clean it every 20 seconds of use otherwise the motor would overheat the dust bin would still be nearly empty it has been that way since the very first time i used it
this is a definitely a disposable vacuum the hose is too thin so it gets clogged alot and motor burns out 1 month on usage at most ! do n't wast your money
this product works well for me i have a very small house but getting the hepa filters that go with it is harder than finding that needle in the haystack you used to be able to get them at most retail stores now wo n't even supply them to the vacuum specialty companies i 've made tons of calls and all they 've done is echo my complaints the only way i was able to find them besides on this site was through itself they try to get you to sign up for their filters for life '' program first on their site which is a ripoff if you just order their filters they do n't give you an 800 number to call i found one in an old filter box they want you to do it all over the web why because they 're in india at least the customer service '' people are while waiting on my filters to arrive i borrowed another model shark vacuum from someone and i could n't even get to the air filter to clean it the instructions say it should just pop out ha ha clearly does n't want you to keep their products for a long time which is why they stop making the parts easy to get after a few years i have only had my vacuum for three years not thirty it should be easier to get filters than this much much much easier i spent a minimum of eight hours trying to get these filters over a few weeks next time i 'm buying a bissell
do n't just skip this vac but avoid all shark products i can echo what a previous reviewer said unit will die on your after minimal use i made the mistake of buying two sharks this one and a small hand held one for my car as soon as i use the hand held for more than a minute it gives off a a burnt rubber smell this one began to do the same after being used only two or three times and died completely on the fourth clean up the container was never really full so it was not a case of overload on either unit at least not user overload my best guess as to what is wrong with this product is that they put some great filters on a cheap motor the motor is n't strong enough to pull the dirt through the filter and quickly burns out they had to know that when they made these what a rip ! !
i just use it on hardwood and tile and it still does n't pick up cat hair basically it 's a very noisy fake vacuum cleaner the suction on it after 2 months of light use is about the same as a very soft breeze
i bought this vacuum as a cheap in between '' vacuum while i saved up to get a better one it did a pretty good job cleaning my small apartment for about a month it has a nice led which tells you when you need to clean the cup and filter this is also unfortunently when the vacuums suction has dwindled to nill this happens often after a few minutes of medium to heavy cleaning the whole thing needs to be cleaned otherwise your just pushing the thing back and forth for show after about a month this condition became permanent the light stayed on and the vacuum was basically useless i hesitate to give this product one star because it would probably be good for small jobs and light cleaning just do n't buy it and expect it to be your primary vacuum
i bought this coffee maker and after only using it times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk
great water ! that is why it got a 2 otherwise it would have receive a 0. i do love the look of that pitcher but every one i have seen leaks after just a month or two it leaks from the bottom seal and that is what makes it worthless i thought that i could just replace it and get a new one and it would be ok it did the same thing times in a row good thing i only paid for it once i have a friend that replaced hers after the same issue and her second one did the same thing i gave up on this and looking for another picture attn pur company ! ! ! ! fix the leaking issue and i will come running back to buy a new one
i got this pitcher about 5 months ago and sure enough i ran into the same leaking problems like everyone else i should have checked up on this pitcher before the purchase from target good thing my mom bought it and not me
i have this filter only for about 3 months and it is already leaking on the seams i crazy glued it and it works while i 'm waiting for a new system from aquafana although the water tastes great it takes about 30 minutes to filter the reservoir i would not recommeded for anyone
the pitcher is difficult to disassemble for cleaning while in the process of trying to remove it one day the whole thing bounced across the kitchen and broke apart i 'm glad because that kept me from having to deal with any more frustration from this i like to wash pitchers in the dishwasher every time i change a filter and it was pur hell every time i had to change this thing pur designers came up with a good looking pitcher that is a trial to use because it cracks leaks or gets broke when the consumer tries to take it apart did n't they employ any real people to test this thing before they took our money to do the same thing regardless of the instructions which i every time i had to take it apart this pitcher is not easy to disassemble it 's pur torture the filter is good the water tastes good but i wish there were a way to get my money back on this pitcher that turned me into a raving lunatic with minor cuts abrasions every time i wanted to take it apart
this teacup has a beautiful design but i was very disappointed when i received it the cup and saucer were much thicker than i would have expected for a china teacup ! it also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer i sent it back as i could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup
this whisk does not stand up like a wire whisk it is not sturdy however it looks very nice sitting in my emeril tin on the counter
i ended up with three of these litterboxes from other people who hated them as well here 's the thing with the grate in they 're very cramped for even the tiniest cat your cat can just deal with it for your convenience not so my friend because of the cramped quarters your cat will inevitably end up defecating or urinating on the grate which makes the entire sifting '' action of it virtually nil so as it stands i 'm yanking the grate covering up the drawer hole and using my reliable old scoop
the litter box does not work as advertized it says to roll it over and the clumped litter will fall into the collection container well it does not go into the container you have to scoop it out yourself which is very inconvenient would not recommend this product it is no better than a regular litter box that you have to take the litter lumps out of
first of all it was difficult really impossible to put it together in a way that litter would n't leak out whenever the box was rolled to clean it the parts fit very poorly secondly if your cat uses scoopable litter now you know that sometimes the liquid penetrates to the bottom of the box so instead of having a discrete clump you have a clump stuck to the box the omega paw does not deal with these at all so you still end up scraping and scooping albeit less often than with a regular box thirdly this box is big so big that it was a problem to give it enough space so that it could be rolled over to clean because of this it was also bulky and awkward to i used it for awhile did n't hate it but disliked it enough to get rid of it when i moved
this was one of the worst purchases i 've ever made the problem that i had with mine is the litter pouring out all over the place everytime i went to flip the thing over the litter came out of the cracks everytime that i went to take out the little drawer that is supposed to hold the waste more litter came out i ended up using it just as a regular litter box it was a complete disaster if i tried to use it otherwise plus the opening of the litter box is so low that everytime the cat goes in and out even more litter comes out of it i 'm getting ready to throw it in the garbage once and for all but i must admit i 've never had any satisfaction from it
we love using the microwave for rice not faster but simple easy to clean leaves the stove top free for other dinner preparations but this version is not a good choice the top leaves a layer of boiling water when you take it out the plastic pot gets a little soft and flexible and finally it breaks easily when it falls to the ground oops different one next hopefully like our old faithful from chinatown that lasted for years
i bought a few of these on amazon thinking that it would be nice as gifts i tried one at home first since i hate breaking out the rice cooker to make rice for 1 person i followed the directions and put it in the microwave i ended up with hard undercooked rice and a mess in my microwave the water boiled over and went everywhere and since it is rice water it was starchy and hard to clean now i have 2 unopened boxes waiting for the salvation army what a
i received this as a gift from my wish list the oven does not get hot enough to brown food same for the broiler i 'm sorry i own it it takes up way too much room on my counter
similar to another review mine is totally dead at about the 4 month mark it no longer powered on hopefully shipping costs to send it back to them are n't too bad was nice while it worked
lasted less than a year
i still have not gotten it to work the motor works but i ca n't get suction into the inlet tube the basket that holds the carbon media is very poorly designed it opens easily spilling the charcoal out into the canister where it does n't belong i did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place there is also a rigid core '' that fits inside the basket my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it i can see how it would happen i reordered a replacement and it was several weeks before it shipped overall i have not had a very good experience with this filter although if i could get the thing to work i might form a different opinion
works until the batteries go dead without warning then it 's impossible to remove from a partially opened can in spite of instructions to the contrary avoid this product as it 'll last only as long as your first set of batteries
i tried to buy this opener for my mother for christmas but they were sold out everywhere so i bought her a good manual one instead and was i glad i did after recieving one ourself for christmas this product is nothing short of junk i bought the best batteries you can first can it opened just labored to no end the second can it got stuck half way through and had to struggle to get it off the can i then checked the batteries and they were real good i can not recommend this product i agree with the other reviews a over rated piece of junk ! ! ! in the garbage it go'
it 's junk bought one opened 15 cans and it quit i agree with all the other 9 out of 13 reviews it powered out and no matter which brand of battery you put in it it wo n't start up again i was stupid enough to buy a second one thinking it might be my fault got the same result at 20.00 apiece the better business bureau should shut this company down
i love my dyson vacuum because it works better than any other vacuum i 've ever owned and i have spent more money on other vacuums and i have been disappointed until now but the floor attachment is an overpriced piece of junk and i am being polite dyson should have made it differently because i am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment
i bought this attachment after discovering that the base of my new dyson vacuum stood too high off the floor to be used under and around furniture the attachment cleans as promised but i have decided that using it is more trouble than it 's worth the attachment connects to the wand not to the base which requires a several step process to use it back and forth as you clean the floors it is bulky 12 '' x 10.5 '' x 7 '' and there 's no place to store it on the vacuum so it 's taking up a lot of shelf space in my cleaning closet and i have to carry it around with me from room to room as i clean dyson makes a great vacuum with especially brilliant design features it 's disappointing that the standard vacuum does n't allow for cleaning which should be a basic and this attachment does n't really make up for it after using the attachment a few times i decided to rely upon my roomba instead for the areas that the dyson without attachment ca n't cover the roomba does a much better job of going around chair legs and i do n't have to be there ! if i had it to do over i would n't have purchased this item put your toward a robot cleaner SMILE
a real tagine in morocco has a hole at the top for the steam to escape this has no hole and therefore cooks like a dutch oven the chicken will literally boil to death and drown the product is made in thailand says so on the box and is so hot after a half an hour that you can not touch any part of it unlike it 's claim this product to me having been served a chicken tagine for over a month in morocco is culinary fraud and the price is highway robbery i do not recommend buying this product at all
when i saw this advertised i thought what a great idea to make tea cakes for a mother 's day tea for the young and not so young after getting one today i decided to just use a mix for a quick trial i used a lemon poppy seed muffin mix when i took them out of the pan they just looked like splotchy blobs they had not browned evenly and the patterns did not show clearly if at all a very small ice cream scoop made filling easier if you over fill they really look like complete blobs maybe a thinner batter would give better definition of the shapes i do n't know what to do about the browning i may try one more time then back it goes anyone with any experience with this product
when i received this item i immediatley knew that something would be box it was packaged in and delivered in was open and torn open like someone opened it i mean it was sent in a box with no bottom and no side just taped together with opened it and thought well it maybe ok this is a big item to send the right front wheel is off balance from the rest so the whole machine wobbles the back panel had puncture marks in it and was off level from the rest of the machine i thought jeez what have i bought so i thought well i will hook it up and use it see how it does it ran beautifully and cleaned my dishes cleaner than i have ever seen them at that point i thought well the damage is in the back and the wheel doesn not cause it to wobble while it is running so i will just be grateful i finally have a dishwasher as i was unhooking it from the sink the ball bearings that hold the connector piece in place fell out and down my sink so i spent 2 days trying to call the company and get a replacement piece or something nothing no answer at all during the times they say they are in the office there is still no answer so i searched online and in stores for this piece nowhere ! ! ! danby is not even registered at sears or maytag ar any big dishwasher supplier for that matter hell all of the actual plumbing repair stores did not have the piece i needed i was told over and over again no one really uses that hook up anymore ma'am or wow what an ancient piece '' so i went online and had to order a 90.00 hose and hook up from ge once it came in i realized it was not compatble with this danby dishwasher so i spent another week trying to call danby and still no answer finally my husband cut the tubes from the dishwasher and used hose clamps and metal nipples to piece the dishwasher hoses and the new ge hookup together i did have to go out and buy a new adapter for my sink as the danby one does not work with the ge but now the dishwasher works and it still cleans beautifully the ge hookup is made with little plastic nudules that can not fall out instead of ball bearings which if you are not careful will fall down your sink so i would have liked to give this product a 1 or even a 0 based on customer service none and the way that the item was packaged and the way it arrived so damaged but the dishwasher does slean so very well you dont even have to rinse the plates before you put them in and they still come out sparkly so all in all i would never ever buy from them again if you add up the cost of the dishwasher and shipping plus all the money it took to repair it i could have gotten a much higher quality dishwasher with no problems at all for less than what this dishwasher cost me in the end
the door on the dishwasher does not shut properly the top drawer is hard to get in and out the metal prongs on the bottom shelf which hold the dishes are so close together they will only hold a super thin dish to get a full sized plate or bowl or anything besides a super thin plate you have to shove them in and bend the prongs the bottom front part that mounts at the bottom of the unit is actually wider than the main door and looks bad cheap construction from top to bottom flimsey poorly built a terrible buy
see do not buy this machine or any other danby product for that matter because their customer service is nonexistent i owned my danby portable dishwaser for about 6 months before my latch broke and the wash cycle therefore would not start i live in hartford ct and i called all of the service centers listed on danby 's website in ct and they either stopped working on danby products which i will address later or they would not travel to hartford or they would not return my phone call after a week of waiting for a return call from the messages i left i decided to call customer service and they actually gave me a service phone number that would come out to look at my machine and repair it after the repairman looked at the machine he told me that he needed to order a part for it a week later i called the service center and they stated that the part that i needed was on backorder for 4 weeks i called danby customer service and stated that it was unacceptable that i should have to wait 4 more weeks for my dishwasher to be available for use they told me that it was not their responsibility and to return it to the place that i bought it i called the retailer and they stated that they had never heard that before and that they would call danby and verify this statement i called the reteiler a week later and they said that they had left several messages and danby never returned one call ! ! ! after this i relunctantly realized that i would have to wait until the part came in a full 6 weeks after the initial service visit i called the service provider they stated that they have not receieved the part yet and that they severed their relationship with danby because of the extremely poor customer service parts backordered etc but they would honor their commitment to me whenever the part came in the convenience of this portable dishwasher is dwarfed by the incompetence of danby 's customer support i will never purchase another danby product again nor will i ever recommend one to anyone else i will however make it a point that if someone ever mentions the danby name to me again to ensure that they walk away from the conversation feeling exactly the same way about danby that i currently do ok after i finally got so fed up that i called danby again and to my surprise the woman that took my call actuallly listened to my story and told me that she was sorry and that she would get a replacement machine to me right away the machine came in 3 business days and they took away the broken one the whole experience '' that i went through with this machine has been less than memorable although the machine works very well and the fact that it was eventually replaced still does not overcome the grief that i was put through by danby 's customer service the fact that there was one good apple '' in a basket of rotten ones does not change my mind that this machine and all danby poroducts should be avoided due to lack of customer service
i thought this pillow would be the answer ! its a great idea but one insert is to flat two inserts is ok all three memory foam inserts are way to much and pillow ear oh my aching ears i have had pillow ear pain before but never like this i am not sure my ears will ever be the same and sadly i probably have to stop using this pillow ! it needs help
very bad metal quality easy oxidize with white patina after every first few grounded peaces always have black color not worth buying
1. bad guality hall for driver shaft was off center 2. bad body metal was reacting with meat made it dark and darkened itself 3. body is too deep hard to reach to wash it
i agree with some of the other reviewers my pups just would n't touch this toy i roll it around and did everything to get them interested in it but they just did n't find it interesting i even took it apart by cutting the rings and using heavy duty tape to reconnect each piece and thought maybe they 'd use it as a teether but that did n't even give them interest i just threw it away and got them their old trusty tennis balls which they got nuts for i 'd just say stick with the old trusty than going fancy !
my dog wo n't touch this thing and i 'm pretty sure it 's because of the smell i even tried putting peanut butter on it and he refused to lick it off he hates this toy
this is a cute toy i guess for a little toy type dog my dobermans got a hold of it and it was falling apart in minutes it 's value probobly depends on your dog
my dog loved this toy for about half an hour and then one of the twisted connections came loose then another pretty soon i had to take it away from her
i am a recently instant to a 6 rottweiler and thought i 'd get her some fun new toys this nobbly wobbly looked cute opened the box yesterday morning and she was sooooo excited to play with the ball n't bother ! ! ! ! this ball lasted not even 24 hours before it was torn apart kind of bummed i did n't read the customer review before hand sorry charlie we 'll find you a new toy
it is a great toy our sheltie could catch a ball in the air when he was only 10 weeks old and is ball crazy this ball was one of his favorites however dogs will gnarl and chew and if a sheltie can chew it into tiny pieces i would hate to see what our golden retreiver could do we bought it in different sizes so going up to the larger size did not stop it from being in pieces in a week 's time the construction just did n't stand up to the teeth
the lid on this product does n't fit the pitcher i thought it was the product was new and it had to be broken in but i 've been using it and it 's still too tight i have to struggle to put the lid on no other issues with the product but it 's a bit annoying to struggle to palce the lid on everytime i try to use it
i absolutely loved this blender but it abruptly stopped working one day after i 'd only had it for 6 weeks ! no sign of life in it whatsoeveer but when it worked it was the best i 'm trying to return it as we speak we 'll see what happens
i was excited about this blender boy was i disappointed a tiny flimsy plastic jar the motor was fine but the jar lasted two uses and it cost 50.00 for a replacement when i tried to buy a new jar there were non available so i bought a complete new smoothie maker by back to basics with a large glass jar for just 70.00 i love my back to basis i ca n't believe i paid over 300.00 for a piece of junk
my first one failed in 5 weeks the clock would reset to three dashes after brewing a pot of coffee it was replaced with new even shipped before returned for a 10 charge to my credit card the carafe does n't hold the 10 cup max you end up with coffe on your counter if you brew 10 cups the internal grinder works well its loud so using it early in the am for that first pot is not feasible unless you want to use it a an alarm clock the grinder always ends up damp so you constantly need to dry it off it would have been a better system if they made the grinder insert optional for brewing coffee if you try to leave the grinder out of the system it beeps at you and wo n't do anything i assume it is safety feature but it is annoying to clean a damp grinder when you do n't use it the best feature is the carafe you put the top on and that 's it you pour a cup without having to adjust the top and end up spilling hot coffee on you or the counter it is a little cumbersome getting the last cup out of carafe but a minor complaint if it dies again i will get it replaced under warranty if the warranty is done i will not get the exact replacement i will only get a coffee pot and live with a seperate coffe grinder on the counter next to the coffe pot
i gave this machine 1 star because the carafe does not drip and this is important ! however for a household that brews several pots of coffee a day and likes a good rich bold cup of coffee the cuisinart grind brew is a poor choice the grinder does n't have the bean capacity for 10 cups however the carafe is really closer to 8 or 9 cups weak coffee if you grind a batch then turn it off and grind a second go to make a suitable pot it is still weak somehow the brewing process wastes coffee it backs up into the grinder and makes a royal mess of course if you want to brew another pot in an hour or two the grinder has to be after you wash it with a bottle brush to get all of the wasted caked wet grounds out of the grinder now here 's the real kicker that nearly drove my husband over the edge say you 've washed the grinder and it 's drying in your drainer so you decide to brew a pot of ground coffee you still have to use the grinder ! ! ! it wo n't brew without it in place ! so all that condensation flows right back up into the grinder which stays perpetually wet and begins to pool in all the indentations here and there in the grinding chamber it 's a mess the coffee us terrible even if you use plentiful bold starbucks coffee ! ! gosh ! we might as well have flushed 150 down our toilet
this coffee pot was excellent when i first purchased it the coffee tasted wonderful and it was always hot and brewed quickly it has n't been a year yet and the coffee takes for ever to brew there are grounds in the brewed coffee and worst of all the coffee pours out all over the counter rarely do you get a whole pot of coffee it still tastes great but what a mess it is also very hard to fill the water resevoir with water cleaning is a chore this is my third cusinart coffee pot in 5 years and i will never buy another one from them they look great work well at first but do not last i thought i just had bad coffee pot karma but i think its the company time to find another brand
i waited along time to buy this coffee maker after it finally went on sale i went and made the plunge and bought it i was so excited when i finally got it but boy was i wrong it is very complicated to get it programed it was very unclear also there are too many parts to it and too hard to clean the most dissapointing part was the thermal caraf it took at least about 30 seconds for a full cup to be poured it was so slow there is no adjustment to the lid what a waste of time and money i wish i had read all the reviews before i bought it
if your idea of a good time is to spend an hour cleaning coffee grounds out of everything after every pot is brewed go ahead and buy this little beauty on the other hand if you like coffee that does n't contain 6 parts grounds to every cup of drinkable coffee a coffee maker that does n't have to be completely disassembled steam cleaned and reassembled with each use a coffee maker that does n't sound like a jet has just landed in the kitchen well then my friend keep looking this machine deserves a class action suit but since that takes too much time i just threw mine in the trash do n't even bother to recycle
i thought it would be so cool not to be cleaning my grinds up everyday boy was i wrong this is the worse mess to i dream of my coffee i spent so much on it i ca n't get rid of it yet do not bu
please take my advice and buy another coffee maker ! made excellent coffee at the beginning within a couple of months we started spending many mornings wiping up the entire pot of coffee that brewed and dispensed onto the counter then the grinder started randomly starting itself and not shutting off total waste of money ! ! !
this was by far the worst coffee pot i have ever purchased at first it made fabulous coffee however things just never worked correctly after 3 months it would n't continuously brew a full pot of coffee for whatever reason it was an arduous task to clean it it was a great day when i got rid of this coffeemaker
i had the same experience as the other reviewers the kettle looks great but started to leak when filled over the half way mark after a few weeks of mopping up the element burned out nice design but poor quality
this kettle is nice looking heats water to a boil very fast the problem is that it only lasted 6 month anyone up for a class action suit against the maker for foisting this evidently flawed designed kettle on us consumers out of the many kettles and hot air pots i 've used over the years this was the shortest lasting one come on it 's just a hot water pot how hard can it be to design one that will work for years pass on this one unless doing returns and getting manufacturer help to replace it is your thing
i purchsed this kettle about half a year ago and it 's already broken the switch kept turning off automatically before boiling on top of that the outside is not insulated and i got burned by it
mine broke in 11 months it switches off by itself before the water gets boiled
i tried to change the of stars to 4 in this edited review but could n't the mm is cheaply made even by current chinese standards does n't have a switch you just press a plastic thingy against a metal reed to make voltage contact length of mm with frother is 7.25 '' length of aerolatte al is 8.25 '' weight with batteries mm al mm motor is as powerful as the al mm shaft is thicker than al shaft the al has a little circular whisk on the bottom the mm has a disc with 16 little teeth a 45 degree angle to the disk surprisingly the mm frother disc generates less drag in liquid and spins faster than the ae i believe the mm actually does a better job it frothes like hell i give the al 4 stars mostly for apparent and the mm 4 stars for outstanding cheap performance
i do not recomend the sango nova dishes and accessories i loved the look of these dishes so i bought everything that went together only to be dissapointed crack after crack i have now had my set a year i honestly can say every plate bowl cup saucer has chips or cracks in it a waste of money i would give 0 stars my cheap college dishes from walmart lasted me years
although these are rated for use in an oven up to 500 degrees mine cracked the first time i used them in an oven which was only set to 375 degrees they are pretty thin not much thicker or heavier than dinner plates really so do n't inspire a lot of confidence when you hold them so really they should get zero stars but if you do n't plan to use them in the oven but just as serving dishes they would be cute
the good reviews swayed me to try this discount duvet cover as the adage goes however you get what you pay for the duvet looked nice coming out of the packaging but it pills terribly i would never purchase this again
i did n't like these sheets because you have to put them inside of the matress i do like their softness though but they are very hard to put on the bed
as careful as i have been the pans are already warping and the finish on one is ruined the pots are no longer round so the lids do not fit properly i can not even use them to make rice as too much steam is released through the gap between the pot and the lid i have followed the instructions faithfully but have yet been able to keep the pans from sticking frankly they are not much better than the regular teflon after the coating has started coming off the information posted said they were ok for ceramic stoves but i can not help but wonder if this is the problem as other people seem to think the pans are great i do like being able to use metal utensils with them but that 's about the only good thing i can say
so that others do not make the mistake that i did i am writing this review this cookware performed well for about two years however we have a large family and put it in the dishwasher regularly it has been 5 years and this cookware has not stood up to regular use do not mistake kitchen essentials for professional cookware now when we cook mashed potatoes we do not know if the potatoes were peppered or just the flaking teflon all of the pieces used daily are now aluminum the outside of the cookware is chalky in appearance i am sure this is from the dishwasher we used plastic utensils most of the time but you know how it is when you are in a hurry to feed to kids my recommendation is to spend the money on high quality stainless steel cookware we have recently purchased calphalon and so far we are really pleased the stainless steel cleans up easily or at least as easy as the kitchen essentials for the money go stainless and you will never have to purchase cookware again
almost every china made product that i use is of the worst quality and these are no exception i bought this set and a larger flat baking pan for my wife the very first time i cooked something with either of the flat pans they warped in the oven when they cool down they flaten out again so everytime i cook with them i hear a crashing sound from the oven after reading other reviews on calphalon i thought i was buying quality bakeware got the packages and saw the fine print reading made in china '' somehow i knew there was going to be a problem so i 've decided to ditch this garbage and get something made in the like pyrex glass bakeware its not but since is a pita to take care of ca n't wash in the dishwasher ca n't stack the pans out a protection sheet so they do n't get scratched etc i do n't really care spray is cheap do n't get suckered and perhaps support the economy at the same time and buy something else and to the calphalon lover above yes i make it my hobby to run around spreading lies about bakeware ! ! ! ahahahahha ! ! grow up i 've had problems with them warping if you would like i can send you some pics global economy '' yeah sure thats fine as long as your job is n't sent over seas to people who get paid a fraction of what you would btw i 'm a student in college so please do n't think i 'm an old bitter person who 's job got sent away i just think its pathetic that companies sacrifice our economy and their product quality to make a few more bucks also your logic that it would take many many hours at '' to warp a pan is quite odd what do you think happens to the pan after it reaches later its still as well as 2 days later so if its going to warp at it 'll do it when it reaches that temp not at some random time thereafter and no the oven was n't at 500 i believe it was 450 that the french fry maker suggested
well after buying some of italy 's best pots or cookware where the inside is a slick finish not sand coated le creusant i was hoping that someone else had come up with a pot as good or a skillet if you may however i am disappointed in my skillet yes it has a sandy finish or rough if you will not what i was looking for it however does cook very well or fry and does clean up easy hey would spend a few hundred bucks to find the skillet i want these guys just do n't have it the wording of the skillet did not indicate a rough inside finish
i have had this coffee maker for about a month now and i hate it i will first say the coffe brews fast tastes good stays hot for a long time the one thing i just ca n't understand is why they made the carafe the way they did it is impossible to pour any liquid from it without it spilling everywhere whether it be filling the tank with plain water or pouring a cup of coffee the pot is big then tapers down to a tiny spout and i just do n't know what happens but it goes everywhere i have to pour my coffee over the sink now and i usually make only 10 cups of coffee but since tons of water spill out when i 'm filling the tank i have to fill the pot to the brim to make up for all the water i 'm loosing i just hate this thing and really regret buying it coffee should have just kept the old design this is just horrible i may even box it up and see if i can return it as far as i 'm concerned it 's defective
i adopted a feral cat who was easily frightened and skittish all the time i bought this spray and the diffuser and was very disappointed to find that neither one worked his behavior has n't changed at all he is still as anxious as before maybe some cats just do n't react to the facial pheromones '' found in feliway i think this product is a hit or miss
i had high hopes from reading reviews on this product but it has not worked for me waste of money
i am very disappointed with this does not look like anything in the picture not worth your money
i was really impressed by looking at the pictures but when i recieved the product it was totally different the material looks different and it was a used product
pros 1 cheap 2 looks pretty cons 1 polyester not good to sleep in buy this only if you want to use it for decorating a polyester fabric feels rough and coarse and is not at all worthy to sleep on 2 less thread count overall its just as good as the money it asks for ! if you want to have a good sleep then spend some more money on a 100 cotton comforter all the comforters from malibu seem to have the same properties
this comforter set is a big disappointment it looks much better in photo than in real the of the comforter is very low and it feels like rough plastic the kid 's comforter i had feels a lot softer and smoother than this also the king size comforter is small this list price is a joke do not recommend not even for the guest bedroom
wish i had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before i purchased this i went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 15 years after it got the new plastic taste out of it it made good coffee even without the brita filter just like all the reviewers indicated the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully unfortunately it has quit working after only 2 months the seller etronics is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period that will be the last thing i buy through them like uhh since they sell braun one would think they would have some recourse through braun and try to help their customers so here i am between the proverbial rock and a hard place try to find a braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced or just bite the bullet an go buy another want to bet it wo n't be a braun additionally what do we do for coffee in the mean time such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet
i 've had two of these now and they both had one serious flaw the trumpeted brew and pause '' feature does not work pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it were n't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up also it 's hard not to spill some water on the heating plate either during filling or brewing creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience if you live in a steak house considering how many other coffee makers are available out there these flaws make this machine a mistake too bad because some things are done quite nicely the controls are good and easy to set and the overall styling is sleek and compact unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps the water filters do about as much as a rain dance pass on this one
i loved this coffeemaker until it just suddenly stopped working and it is n't even 1 year old ! ! previous coffeemakers i owned have lasted years and years i expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over now i have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle i am not a happy customer
my previous coffe pot a cheapie developed a habit of overflowing because the cheezy sneak a cup '' mechanism would not function properly creating the equivalent of a flooding toilet well i spent right here on amazon to buy the braun instead and guess what i now have an overpriced flooding coffee toilet i have owned this unit for around 6 months now and on a given day it a produce the flooding coffee toilet effect with grounds and coffee everywhere 15 chance b leak so much coffee during brewing that what started out as a full pot ends up as an pot with the remainder on the counter 80 chance careful observation indicates this is due to a badly designed sneak a cup '' feature the coffee creates a surface tension on the base of the basket and trickles off to the edge of the coffee maker instead of dripping into the carafe deliver the expected pot of coffee 5 chance note on option i keep the coffee maker on a tray because i got tired of cleaning up after it i will buy another braun i should have boxed this unit up and returned it to amazon the first week i had it i kept saying to myself it must be good it was rated the best ! '' well guess what i would rate it a zero star but the least amazon will let me give it is a 1
i have n't had a problem with this item but that does n't really matter i wo n't use it anyway because it makes awful coffee i am sorry i wasted my money on it
just got this brand new for the holidays and i 'm here on line ordering a replacement already drips all over the place filter basket is very tricky to reinsert after emptying and sometimes slips back out coffee is just
my mother swore by hamilton beach appliances this is one that i find myself swearing at ! the carafe itself is very drippy i can not pour a cup of coffee without having to wipe down the counter afterwards the paper filters constantly collapse in the brewing basket and then come out drippy and messy also i miss my old mellita this coffee maker needs alot of help sorry hamilton beach i 'm calling it as i see it !
if you want to get a migraine and be stuck without a mixer for the holidays this would be the company that you would order from it is now january and i have yet to receive the mixer or refund on the purchase of this product i have called and called and called jr electronics and to no avail i still havent received a refund for this product
as at least two reviewers of the similar oster toaster oven experienced the top two burner elements gave out after about a year that is at least three customers with the exact same complaint this could not be a coincidence w ell actually it could be a coincidence but that is highly unlikely however most toaster ovens in this price range last about months in my experience having replaced many over the years so perhaps one should expect to pay about per year for a toaster oven if so this model is fine
i bought it from another store turned it on to toast it did nothing changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke i smell a recall
this toaster oven 's timer is faulty we were making toast next thing we knew there was smoke bellowing out from it and the toast itself was on fire ! ! ! with today 's technology oster should take more care in providing a toaster oven with an accurate timer this oven almost started a house fire i would not recommend this oven to anyone
being a huge fan of kitchenaid products i was happy to see this item at target when i took it out of the bag at home i noticed a chip on the edge and a crack starting to run the length of the side the item was not broken when i purchased it it must 've broken when my daughter dropped it on the driveway the plastic is hard not flexible very disappointed in this kitchenaid product
i was sooooo happy when i read these reviews because i was ready to give up on slow cooking entirely i have burned everything i 've ever cooked in i thought it was me ! i 'm actually a great cook and used to make fun of slow cooking but with a family it made sense i bought this because i had started with a smaller version and i wanted a larger crock pot with the 10 hour setting i had some success with the smaller rival but it was simply too small to do anything except reheat soup i thought i 'd try this one since it was bigger had more features etc wrong i promise i 'm not after 6 hours in this thing at the 10 hour setting everything has been burned beyond i was told it was impossible to burn anything in a crock pot wrong seriously get another one i 'm online now searching for a different brand that hopefully wo n't set my house on fire
i only use this crockpot for soups temp is way too hot for other dishes i have one with a divided crock which is a great idea for buffets chili on one side bean soup on the other but you have to remember it has no low or warm just high so you need to turn it on and off occasionally i use the smaller crockpot i bought in 1979 to cook things that need more finesse if there really were a high low and warm on this cooker as the company states it would be a wonderful product unfortunately the company claims are not truthful
very disappointed this pot looks great but it cooks way too hot even on the lowest setting the ceramic pot also cracked on my use i think it was too hot all the contents leaked out and burned a waste of money
i bought mine at bed bath and beyond with a coupon it was one of two crock pots they sold so there was n't much choice i had to replace my previous rival as steam kept coming out of the lid and spewing liquid everywhere and the knob melted off ! ! right away this lid does n't even fit the crock not only does it rock back and forth it has a gap in it that you can actually see inside of i get that you ca n't pressure seal these things but i can see steam liquids and spewing from this one too after reading the reviews of it being too hot i am returning it
i purchased this set only to find out when it arrived that the bowls are really too small for a realistic sized serving to the brim is an exaggeration they will hold about half a cup in real life
first time ordering through amazon and probably the last the item arrived to me chipped and cracked also having a difficult time getting my money back ! good luck dealing with customer service
the item itself was lovely and of good quality the problem was most definitely the poor packaging the beautiful metal cradle that is included rattled around and dented and even chipped the wooden bowl multiple times i ordered this product twice even giving the reason for my return of the first salad bowl the second one i received was packaged even worse this was very inconvenient since it was to be a christmas gift i suspected it the second time so i asked the ups guy to stay til i looked at the item itself lo and behold it was once again damaged and i sent it on its way on the spot anyone ordering this product i advise you to do the same ! this situation forced me to do what i was trying to avoid last minute holiday rush traffic jams everywhere shopping
i received a bowl and it was cracked i returned it and another bowl was sent this one was also cracked waiting on further directions frustrated they did not check the condition before mailing bowl
beautiful item mine also arrived with chips on the outside rim beautiful set have not received my refund yet but suspect it is a delay due to the holidays
i got a pair of these from amazon because the price was right or was it turns out that even at a bargain basement price these towels were no deal they 're relatively thin and poorly constructed they shed like crazy and i suspect they 'll be dust in short order not that they 're gon na stay in my house long enough to find out these are hardly luxury '' quality towels i made a mistake with my money now i 'm trying to help you avoid the same mistake put the mouse down now and walk away from the terminal
my honeywell remote control fan just died it has been about three months since i purchased it it was used with reasonable frequency it has a warrenty from kaz inc but you have to send a 10 check for handling return packaging and shipping charges on top of what you will have to pay to mail it back to kaz i paid 43.99 on amazon so it would cost me another 25 to get it after only having it for three months
i bought this item based on various reviews here and on other sites usually when the majority of reviews lean one way i find they tend to be correct this time wrong wrong wrong ! ! ! this veggie cutter is a cheap piece of ! it may be ok if all you want to cut are soft veggies but if you want to cut potatoes for french fries dont bother unless you want to blow 20 plus shipping mine lasted less than 2 months before it fell apart a complete waste of my money i had high hopes based upon reviews i had read on this product but i was lead down the potato garden path cutting potatoes the main reason i bought this is quite a chore i had to place it on the floor on a towel to get really good leverage to enable me to cut my potatoes the main product is plastic and the working parts were less than sturdy steel rods i am really disappointed with this product if you are planning on cutting potatoes or other hard veggies then please do not waste your money many people rated this item very high in their reviews i really cant believe these people cut potatoes with this this product just is not sturdy enough for that job ! ! i write this review in hopes that i can save others from throwing their money away searching for a good french fry cutter if you choose to ignore my warning and it breaks on you which it will sooner or later probably sooner yes that will be me you hear saying i told you so '' caveat emptor !
things stick to it no matter what you use go with teflon
coffeemaker just quit yesterday makes cold coffee now unable too use got a three year warranty and lasted three months biggest waste of money yet now call customer service get a busy signal last 15 minutes never buy another hamilton beach product
i did n't even use this coffemaker the apple color was so ugly reminded me of the avocado in kitchens of the 's 60 's and the pot was so heavy clunky i decided to donate this to a charity i read the other reviews everyone loved the color in their kitchen maybe another color would be better but i will not try
i bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is also discovered after i had water and coffee grounds all over that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip i can get my money back and try another bran
this is the first review i 've written for anything i am inspired to write about the krupps burr grinder because it is the most frustrating piece of equipment i have ever owned you have to whack it on the counter three or four times per grind to get it to complete the job we got it as a wedding gift and have since gone back to our blade grinder that saves time and aggravation
pros grind is pretty consistent noise is about what i would expect from a plastic body burr looks like it will outlast any other part cons there is a dial for coarseness of grind we bought this because our coffee machine broke and we decided to try a coffee press a french press needs a coarse grind when you turn the dial on the krups to the absolute coarsest setting the grind is than what you would use for even for automatic drip i tried the finest grind setting and yes it produces a fine powder although it clogged and all got stuck inside the grinder instead of coming out into the container also the beans consistently get stuck and stop feeding into the burr so you usually have to hit it or shake it once or twice during the grind to keep it working i 've tried 3 different kinds of beans so far from medium roast to dark roast does n't seem to make much difference all in all it 's disappointing i expected more with the krups name painted on the front and more for the money it has a lot of automatic features that do n't work very well perhaps they spent too much time on the bells and whistles and not enough time on testing basic function
after the first few weeks the novelty wears off and what you are left with is a toaster that does n't work very well it is a very slow toaster that does not accomodate large pieces of bread while the basic idea of making egg and muffin sandwiches is cool the implementation is poor what you need to know is that the egg is cooked by boiling a measured amount of water the steam cooks the egg but it also condenses all over the egg leaving you with a soggy sandwich
i never received the large bowls the small cereal bowls were sent twice quickly but wrong size both times and i returned both orders i was sent an stating something significant was wrong with the system and i would not be receiving the larger bowls then i got an saying i was being billed for them to which i replied what i received was not what i ordered and had been returned twice i have all the paperwork on both orders the plates i ordered were never received at all i have no idea what is going on now it makes sense that i be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that is n't happening eithe
i assume that amazon 's refusal to ship the power scrubber to an fpo military overseas address is because the batteries are included for the us asking price i 'd be more than willing to get the gadget without the batteries i 'm in japan folks it 's not like there are no aa batteries available here ! now here 's the kicker i can buy it here in japan from a tv shopping network just up the road in hiroshima so how the heck can they get it shipped here batteries or no when i ca n't the price difference btw is 39 locally 19 from amazon
i wish i had my money back i have n't found any time i tried to use this thing that it was any easier than a washrag or sponge i try to use it once in a while like when there 's grease baked on something but it does n't come thru for me the attachments are sitting in my sink getting stinky pretty soon i 'll write it off and toss it
i really wanted to like this dining set it looked nice in the picture and the reviews impressed me however when the set was put together 3 out of 4 chairs wobbled 2 moderately and 1 really bad the difference in leg length was almost an inch the reason was easily identified the connection holes in the back of the chair were drilled in a slanted line instead of horisontal so no tightening the chairs with someone sitting on them would have helped besides there is just not that much leeway with connections but that was not all one of the chairs had a warped back paper thin warped veneer on the backside of the top you did hear me say veneer '' make no mistake the set is not made of solid wood the description does not claim it to be so this is just a reminder compared to the above the tiny laquer drops '' defect on a small area of the table top was minor i gave the set 2 stars only because it does look pretty good if you want to give it a chance and are prepared to mess with getting another set to replace possibly defective items you might get good results after all with 4 items out 5 coming defective i did not bother to test my luck again and simply returned the purchase it took an hour of 2 people 's time to put the set together and then another hour for me to take it apart and try to pack it back in the box keep the box ! as this was the only way to return the set
cheap and splashes water all over the place noisy to
i finally threw my trutemp instant digital thermometer away last night after several inaccurate readings caused me to overcook a lovely piece of beef i had noticed some problems with readings on previous occasions but gave it the benefit of the doubt i am now in the market for a new digital thermometer as the saying goes once burned
the chef knife in the set i received has forging defect the support person kept telling me that henckels had almost perfect quality control the knives should not have any defect but it did i had to return the chef knife for replacement the sufaces for couple other knives were scratched also after two weeks i did receive the replacement knife but it did n't match the original set i did n't bother to send it back again quality poor support person not knowledgable
i had a stainless mug and it really kept the coffee hot for a long time this is much lighter being that it 's plastic it feel cheap and does n't keep the coffee hot at all if you just want something to grab for coffee on the way to work i guess it 's ok but because it 's metal outside you ca n't microwave it it fits in the cup holder and it 's easy to drink from but for long drives it just is n't what i 'd hoped
i bought a 20 '' patton fan in the mid 1980 's used it year round and it lasted 15 years it was a very well built fan and the speed control produced major variations between the low medium and high settings the low setting moved copious amounts of air and was very quiet i just bought this 14 '' model and it 's a cheaply made piece of junk but what can you expect from something made in china the speed control has very little range and the fan is almost as noisy on low as it is on high do not purchase this fan for use anywhere you might sleep or need a quiet source of air movement such as in a tv room etc they are best suited for a small shop or outside while bbqing to keep the mosquitos blown into the neighbor 's yard the chinese do n't use enough padding and filler inside the box to secure the fan during shipment so be advised the fan has plenty of room to flop around inside the factory box add to that the poor packaging amazon uses to add a second box for shipment to the customer and you have what amounts to potential shipping damage looks like the job some clowns do when shipping items they sell on ebay to their credit the fans are inexpensive and move more air than much larger fans
this toaster looks good on your counter and is very sturdy however the toaster 's raison d'etre is to produce toast and at least mine produces very inconsistent toast when i set the toaster on 3 out of 8 and put a piece of wheat bread in it is usually 'well done ' on the side that faces the center brown on the top part that faces the outside and barely done on the bottom part that faces the outside the bun toasting feature which works pretty well is its only saving grace my sunbeam toaster that i bought for 15 dollars was better than this one
nice looking toaster makes good toast but one major problem that i 've had when making toast especially when only making one slice the slice pops right out of the toaster if i 'm not there to catch it like that old i love lucy '' episode where lucy always catches the toast from the toaster when making ricky breakfast i end up picking my toast up from the counter or sometimes the floor unfortunately there 's no way to correct this without having to go through the hassle of having it repaired so i guess i 'm stuck with this projectile toaster '' by the way president bush i think i might have found one of those weapons of mass destruction ''
i needed a good cheap flash light to read vin numbers one of the worst 10 flashlights i ow
i am bitterly disappointed with these towels i was expecting high quality cotton fluffy ones and instead got very average quality they are virtually indistinguishable from the ones i buy from for of the price
baring the calphalon name i was expecting something really nice especially for the price i paid through amazon of 84.95 boy was i disappointed although amazon is selling it as piece the calphalon contemporary stainless saucepan with glass lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the calphalon brand it looks like one of the pans calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware the item arrived nicely boxed in the calphalon box but when i opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a return item before it was sent to me the pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken it looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but i ca n't believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out unless it 's being given to you as a freebie '' i suggest you save your money
we should have thought about it when we ordered i guess but this set does n't include 2 of the most commonly used cups which is too bad we gave ours to good will and ordered a different set alas other than that though the quality is very good
i bought this because i liked the idea of having the water filter inside you ca n't find replacement filters you ca n't measure the water correctly i tried just pouring water in from a cup that did n't work because it goes right into the water filter so it looks like it is at level 3 when it is more the last straw was the other day as the water started to brew through the basket the basket sprang open i had water everywhere it also seems to take a while to brew a small pot of coffee i usually made a 3 or 4 cup pot and it took 8 minutes i will never buy a coffee pot from this company again
after ordering in december received notice after notice of delays and more delays then delivery was not promised until at least april we are talking 4 months after ordering for 4 wine galsses i could have walked down the street and bought at any wine shop a very very disapointed customer these were gifts no explanation was given
if i were to purchase another chocolate fountain i would spend more money and get a better quality one i could n't get an even cascade of chocolate even though the fountain was perfectly level the chocolate does n't stay hot enough either it only stays hot for a few minutes then it stays at room temperature i would n't recommend purchasing this unit
the description of this product says they are and stackable i interpreted that to mean nestable they do n't nest and therefore they do not save much space had i known that i would not have purchased them if you look closely at the picture you will see that there are 2 pictured on top of each other with their lids on this is what they mean by stackable you can also put smaller ones inside bigger ones but even that is not a nice fit and also is n't convenient
i did n't believe other reviewers who indicated that their fan arrived perfectly packaged but inoperable i should have believed them there was no damage to the packaging on my fan but like others have reported the control panel had power but the fan motor was dead i called the company 's tech support line and left a message it was a weekend and they never called me back i called them on the following monday and i was hung up on once and when i called back the person who answered rudely told me to return it through the website company at which i had purchased it i am returning it for sure but will be less willing to buy items like this online in the future
i too have the same complaints as the others i ordered this item in june it is now october and i have yet to receive it in june i was in no great hurry but now with the holidays approaching i would very much like to use my dishes ! ! ! this is totally unacceptable and i 'm thinking about cancelling
i have not received the item just yet so i can not comment on the item itself but just as a warning to all who thinks this is a great deal i ordered this set in the beginning of november of 2004 and it is now 2005 and amazon has been delaying this for the third time now they say it will be the end of april before i will receive it i should cancel but i 'm in no hurry like i said just a warning if you are thinking about this as a gift or any other occation where you need it soon i suggest looking elsewhere update i received my order and the set is gorgeous perfect for any occassion ! definately worth the wait
i can barely feel the heater when i 'm laying right next to it i expected much better from sharper image
my fish bottomupper is now dead you want to know why he is dead it is because of the the greek tried to swim through 1 of the holes at the top of the coliseum and couldnt get he eventually drowned since he couldnt get to the surface for i am deeply depressed since he was my only friend
i ordered two of these pans one for myself and one for my sister we did not receive a stainless pan ! we received an aluminum pan with a black coating on the interior the pans we received were from the collection amazon sent me a new pan but i received another pan so now i have to return two pans and my sister must return one we are both collecting the stainless cookware i am very dissapointed amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan
this pan fails to deliver this pan is the black sheep of the all clad line it is made of solid stainless steel and is not an aluminum triply pan as it is advertised it is also made in korea unlike the other all clad products which are made in the usa shop around there are better products out there for half the price
this is not the product that will be shipped to you i purchased these because the bright blues match my kitchen i am sad to say that none of the blues are in the actual product the burners are green yuck
beautiful looking but the quality is to say the least i had bought this piece along with two bowls which had plastic lids this one broke after one use the lids did n't fit my bowls poor to no quality control in this product
as a previous reviewer reports mine broke as i was lifting it out of the oven the or time i used it
i only had the lasagna pan for a short time and used it maybe four times it was in the oven and simply broke into three large pieces it did n't go from cold to hot or hot to cold it was just in the oven and broke i do n't know what was wrong with it but i am having a hard time contacting the company
i apologize for reviewing a product that i do n't own have never owned and wo n't ever own or need in general i 'm against doing this but in this case i feel really compelled to comment on what appears to be a gimmick and hopefully dissuade some people from wasting their money on it here 's my take on this product it 's a pizza stone with a thermometer and a backsplash i ca n't imagine that the backsplash has any practical use and as for the thermometer let 's put it this way if your grill is nice enough that it 's capable of generating or containing the heat necessary to emulate brick oven pizza it probably has one even if it does n't you can buy one separately for under 10 bucks and be free to use it anywhere in your kitchen or grill area here is what i recommend go buy a bona fide pizza stone or better yet a few unglazed ceramic tiles from home depot for a few bucks that way you can prepare more than one pizza simultaneously for under 99 per pizza my advice is that you can and should put a rig like this together on your own for the price of a large pepperoni from domino 's do n't waste your money or your precious kitchen storage space on this thing
unless you 're really impressed with the color green the filter itself can be picked up at the grocery store the one around the corner from me was selling them for about 1
the set is stainless steel meaning there is no nickel and they will not last as long the pieces are lighter than i expected and look chrome plated and it is rough around the base of the fork tines there is no way this set was ever valued at 120 and it is not worth 60 target sells similar products for about half the price i purchased this as a gift for my and did n't realize the the poor quality until after i had given them to her
like the other reviewer i ordered these and was disappointed to find they are not nice looking set but not the quality i expected
although the flatware is nice looking i bought these because they claimed it was stainless steel what i received was be aware
we 've always used mr coffee coffeemakers a friend raved about this bunn model really fast coffee with great taste so much so she sent one to us as a birthday gift well its great if you dont care about auto i do ! and if you dont care about spilling the coffee when you sneak a cup before the entire brew cycle is finished the good ol ' pause and serve feature i and if you could care less about programming your next pot i do granted it does brew quickly but it just doesnt have the features that i want and use therefore it rates a 1 out of 5
do not buy you will have problems with innova cookware like everybody else does and innova will not do anything about it ! ! ! innova sells faulty cookware does n't honor warranty ! ! ! i would give innova line of cookware 0 stars if i could because there is absolutely nothing positive about it when i first got this pot it seemed but after enamel started chipping off very common problem with innova cookware as i later discovered i contacted customer service and all they told me was '' that would not be covered by the warranty because it does not affect the function of the cookware '' one line no sorry '' thank you '' or whatever not to mention this ridiculous and dirty way to dishonor warranty do not buy or you will be giving your money to thiefs
i used this dutch oven according to the manufacturer 's instructions and after the second use part of the enamel on the bottom of the pot bubbled up and chipped off i called the customer assistance number and found them to be rude and not very helpful i have not decided if i will return the product to innova since they require that the customer pay for shipping the damaged item i will never buy a product from this manufacturer again
have purchased the 5 qt version of this dutch oven during the second use of it the bottom layer developed a bubble separated from there making this utensil totally useless i am now trying out the warranty and see if there really is an exchange for it
i would not recommend this french fry cutter it is very hard to clean and is not very durable
this knife was dull upon receipt i sent it back although i loved the handle shape and color
1. expensive 2. fatally flawed as of january 2007 the sharpener system works well for my knives but the method of attaching the rotating handle to the base is fatally flawed both sharpeners i received had to be returned after uses because the handle separated from the base holding the fingers if furi redesigns the base and handle i 'd buy another one
the hype and sales pitch sounds great but this is far from great i tried it out on a couple of my cheaper knifes to test it first i had a dull knife and brought back a decent edge then i used the diamond fingers and ended up with a blunt edge hmmmm lets try the honing fingers nothing i tried to hone another knife nothing pulled out my steel and achieved a nice sharp edge the furi is junk ! a pro knife sharpening system i do n't know on professional cook who uses this peice of crap do n't waste your time or money
this vacuum was highly rated by consumer reports and at 99.00 reconditioned seemed a good buy it arrived by mail very poorly packed with chunks of styrofoam all over the inside of the box upon assembling i noticed it was missing the attachment tubes and when turned on the brushroll did n't work in addition the finish was marred and smudged i sent it back and ordered a hoover windtunnel 2. it works well and appears to be of higher quality
i keep it on my table for company but actually it grinds so little so slow i do n't use it myself i thought from the ad on it i had at last found something that would grind sea salt this is the third kind i have bought but i 'm still not satisfied i doubt i will try any more brands i may buy a mortar and pestle which is what my son uses at his house
i have no opinion on how this cooks because i never turned it on opened the box and saw that 1 the front of the microwave was silver plastic and 2 only the interior is actually stainless steel and so it did n't match anything in my kitchen sealed it up and sent it back to amazon if you read the description right you 'll see they disclose it 's only the interior that 's stainless but definitely not what i was expecting for the price
your steam fast will rest exactly 2 ft 3 inches from the ground this stand can not change height so it is meant to be used while sitting i do n't iron that many at one time so sitting is not necessary and standing at 5 foot 8 inches and trying to use the steam fast at 2 ft 3 inches can be challenging after i steam i have to get up multiple times to hang the shirts i do n't know why they do n't design a stand the raises the steamer to standing height crazy ! just know what you 're getting and you wo n't be disappointed
this item will indeed brew coffee but not without some shortcomings first the mechanism that allows you to remove and pour a cup while it is brewing does n't work very well you have to use one hand to hold the unit in place while you forcibly shove the coffee pot into place usually resulting in some spilt coffee all over the inside of the unit second for some reason the spout that empties hot water over the grounds inside is mounted on a swivel that you have to move in and out of the way every time you use it only a mild nusience really but nevertheless annoying i suppose the moron who designed it would have you believe it brews a better cup that way but that is obviously nonsense also the opening to pour the water into is very small your aim better be good if this is on an average counter top you 're going to have to lift the water up quite high and hope you can hit the opening without spilling lastly the steam that comes off while it is brewing condenses on the front faceplate where the switches and circuitry is and i ca n't help but believe over time the moisture will penetrate inside and probably short out the just after the warrantly runs out to sum up overpriced ! poor value ! idiotic design
i bought two sets of these towels the ad said name brand but when i saw the label i had never heard of them they feel nice soft and cushy but they are not very absorbent when drying my hands after repeated rubbing and patting my hands were still wet my old towels 17 years old do a much better job of drying me off quickly
this product was n't working and the handle was broken i do n't recommend to purchase this and it 's way to much money for it
i bought this knife for 35.00 at linens and things i vacillated between this and the 80 version i made a mistake when the knife was finally extricated from it 's prison i hefted it felt the edge and examined construction i got less than i paid for the feel and look of this knife is similar to those late night tv special knives but wait there 's more now how much would you pay '' it is just a cheap feeling product also the tip of the knife had a pronounced burr on it that i had to hone off i am too old to be that you get what you pay for
do n't be fooled by the name and the mark spain '' on the blade the blade got nicked in two places after i cut a cob of corn i have two knives for more than 2 years and they were really made in spain they do n't have a single nick yet ! next time i 'll better spend twice as much and buy original henckels knife which is made in germany
unfortunately the pet blinker did n't hold up very well i think a washer fell out or something but the unit came apart after day 1
this may seem like a good aquarium '' but it is not this is far too small for a betta pet shops that sell them in tiny bowls do so because they are an inexpensive way to seperate them the pet shop conditions are intended to be ony temporary my betta is in about a 2.5 gallon tank and is so happy he was once in a small bowl and did nothing just lay on the gravel about a 3 gallon tank will house a much happier fish and a more entertaining one do not buy this
caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper in a small bowl like this the fish 's waste will build up rapidly espcially since there is no filter this causes suffering for example eye and skin irritation sickness and even death you can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently however frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper ! in addition the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly another source of stress for the fish you can not use a heater in a bowl this small bettas are tropical fish they need a tank heated to there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons if you 'd like to care for a fish please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can ignore manufacturers websites since of course they will say their products are great even crummy products like this one get the largest tank you can afford if you ca n't afford a large enough tank please do n't get the fish
the glasses were ok but not great for bordeaux and other red wines additionally only 5 glasses arrived in our box which was intended to be a set of 6 merchant refused to respond to requests to send the glass or provide a refund for the missing glass so we sent all 5 of them back oh well
of the three boxes i ordered over 35 arrived broken when amazon replaced the broken glasses the new box arrived with 2 of 6 glasses broken
the filters fit and do what they are designed to do thought a little costly for what you get unfortunately the mypod that they fit just does n't do anything but make a colored water drink that does n't come close to ecopod or the standard pods for the coffee machine
it almost fits my black and decker home cafe coffee maker but severely binds when i try to close the lid i am going to try to identify the points of obstruction and make it fit by carefully filing plastic as necessary
i bought six of these collars for my five cats i bought an extra just in case one of the cats lost one i thought the colors were great and i was happy with the idea of the material as opposed to cheap vynil they do look fashionable i think and are discreet enough to not take away from the beauty of the cat itself however these collars are not breakaway '' collars they enlarge if they get caught on something but this actually only adds its own problems several times my cats came home with one leg through the collar and the collar extended as far as possible i hated to think what would have happened if the cat had gotten the collar caught on something after getting the leg stuck one cat finally did come home without his and i did n't replace it another came home with the collar around her chest both front legs had gone through and it was constricting her i pulled to try to get it off but it was obviously very painful and in the end the only solution was for me to cut it off i decided these collars are not very safe after all too bad i bought six at once the reviews at the time were pretty good generally i 've taken them all off and now my daughters can play with them on their stuffed animals they look do look cute ! i just do n't trust them on live animals
i was n't happy with this collar first i had n't realized just how thin it would be i wanted small and lightweight but this is hardly wider than a rubber band but more importantly i think the way it adjusts for size is dangerous when i put it on one of my cats the extra length would n't tighten sufficiently so there was a gap which she managed to get her lower jaw hooked into so that the collar was stuck half around her neck and half in her mouth i took it off and threw it away fortunately since it 's so inexpensive i did n't throw away a lot of money also the metal pieces where the size adjustments are made are not terribly smooth you might not want those rough bits of metal against your cat 's neck
i have three cats and i own the litter mate fully automatic litter box already i bought this as a second litter box because it was all i could find and it 's a piece of junk the rake gets stuck with even very little waste in the box and you have to help it along with either your hand or your foot the rake does n't reach the bottom of the box and i usually have of an inch of dried clumped litter stuck to the bottom that i have to scrape out i cleaned the box completely out this morning emptied cleaned inside and out dried thoroughly and put all fresh litter in and the rake got stuck with nothing to move no the box is n't overfull of litter either after doing research as soon as this dies and i suspect it will be very very soon i 'm going to spend the on the litter robot my fully automatic litter mate is n't bad but the rake does require regular cleaning and after a year it 's starting to show it 's age and not run as well we 'll see what i get to replace that when it dies
this was given to us as a gift we returned it the next day although it made nice waffles it had three major faults which are the reasons we returned it 1 the handle is part plastic and part metal the metal portions become extremely hot when the appliance is on 2 the latch on the lid was very difficult to release once the waffles were cooked however on one occasion during the middle of cooking the lid blew open with explosive force and could have caused serious injury if anyone had been standing over it 3 the batter really does go everywhere on this machine it leaked all over the sides and the switch making it a pain to clean there are better safer machines on the market
we ordered what we thought was a drinkwell fresh water fountain based on the header and description of the product however when we received it there was just the resevoir in the box we returned the item to petsmart and then went to petco and purchased a different model we felt the ad was very misleading it should have clearly stated that the item we were purchasing was only the resevoir and not the fountain
this add is extremely misleading there is nothing in the product features or product description to indicate that this price is for the reservior only i read the description several times because the price seemed low and the only thing that saved me from ordering it was kozlen 's review and the very obscure reservoir '' at the end of the product name the fountain is probably a fine product but i will do my shopping elsewhere somewhere without such misleading advertizing
i should have taken more time to research this product after opening the box tonight i realized that what i got was not the fountain it was just the resevoir i will be returning this item
to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with straight candle '' results even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of softer '' look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful we do n't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces
do n't understand previous review it was quick to heat up but only produced a very small amount of steam you had to hold it in one spot for it to actually do anything which was very little would still be here till the next ice age getting out wrinkles totally useless
it only crushes one ! ice cube at a time which seems pretty foolish perhaps if you 're patient you 'll eventually have enough crushed ice but i found the design too frustrating
this item is a waste of time money and aa batteries unless you 're fanatic about foam it
i read the preceding reviews and really question what i did wrong with this unit i tried for 6 months to get this to work right and it never did the ice cream would be too frozen to get to come out of the unit even when i used it to make alcoholic drinks it still froze up ! and alcohol is not suppose to freeze luckily i had purchased it at and even a receipt they refunded the purchase i only wished it would have worked like it promised it 's an impressive unit and people would just look at it in awe but every time i used it people would just be disappointed especially me for what i paid for it ! unless my unit was just defective i will never know but would not even risk trying to buy it again ! it is a beautiful unit but that alone is not worth paying to have it as a pretty countertop decoration
these sheets are aweful they are so wrinkly and stiff i should have listened to all of the other reviewers when they said the same thing trust me they 're not worth the money not matter how good the deal sounds
we bought this about six months ago it looks quite nice but we find it pretty uncomfortable and the quality is fairly poor the fabric does n't hold up well the cushion looks pretty saggy and the fabric is stretched already it filled a gap in our living room furniture after we moved into our first house but we 're looking at paying some additional money for a hardier piece of furniture and moving this up to our bedroom it 's okay for the price but nothing to write home about we 've gotten better quality furniture from target
received the item with a small dent on top which i thought nothing of should n't affect the performance i thought but when i plug everything in the machine just makes a whirring noise no water spraying no movement of the dial after 15 optimistic minutes i gave up returning back for exchange crossing my fingers for the next box
worked ok for 6 months if dial is not in exactly the right notch washer will run forever without stopping then started leaking water everywhere obviously not able to use the product anymore good luck returning something of this size too check return policy 30 days only ! taking item to local repair center tomorrow warranty covers plastic parts for 30 days electrical for 1 year not promising
i moved out to la from ny and there is considerable less amount of humidity in la my skin was drying up so i asked and was recommended this humidifier unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin i blasted it on high and still nothing the filter seems to run out pretty quickly the product seems very fragile the material is cheap and the water tank does n't fit properly into the product so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak the plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap
it arrived cracked and leaked all over my stand and soaked the carpet of course i was supposed to test it in the bathtub for leaks and didnt but before i discovered the leak it is flimsily made i had it on one night and it made my room so cold it was unbearable so i returned to amazon and am awaiting their receipt and refund
i bought this because many claimed how quite it was especially on low setting well the fan is quite on the low setting because it barely moves on the higher settings the entire thing vibrates making a sound you can hear on the floor below even when it is placed on a carpeted floor i am very disappointed with this humidifier so much so that i might just throw it away and get a different one i plan on never buying vornado again
this coffee maker is beautiful however it has a problem the on off switch sticks a lot kitchen aid replaced the entire system for me a few times and finally i gave up and bought a cheaper more reliable coffee maker all the replacements they sent to me developed the same problem
this item is not shipped as depicted in the in the description spin duster this item does not ship with a spin duster on the side of the box was a sticker reading bonus items including spinduster tm are not included in factory refurbished models to order please call '' the replacement parts lists has the spinduster attachment kit for turbo nozzle i can not find it in the box probably a bonus item '' replacement list is 15 there were no extra filters to be found in the box replacement filter is 20 plus 5.50 s h from eureka you 're looking at 70 bucks to obtain the missing items bottom line buy this because you are ok with it missing half the goodies
i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thank
after the first use the teflon coating started to bubble up and after the first week it looked as if were decades old ! it looks nice on the outside makes consistently perfect hard or soft boiled eggs but it looks like crap after a week
this unit sprays a mist of water nicely however any type of oil that i have tried will only be ejected as a weak stream not at all what it is marketed to do it never misted olive oil from the very first day i got it extremely disappointed in this product do not buy this useless gizmo
creates a stream of oil rather than a spray i found it impossible to completely clean the internal parts causing the oil to eventually go rancid and ruin the sprayer
broken after a year way too expensive for what it does n't supply mainly 'mist ' an overpriced 'toy ' customer service is excellent however and the broken part was replaced at no charge i agree with one of the other reviewers if the oil is heavy such as evoo the oil will come out in a stream the best i can say is that the misto might make an adequate plant mister
not worth the trouble holds hardly any liquid seemingly needs to be cleaned after every use waste of money stay away
i have owned a misto for a while and as others have i noticed the way the quality of the spray deteriorated over time so that you would only get a stream of oil instead of a mist well this morning my misto exploded while i was using it to make pancakes periodically spraying the pan during the process luckily no one was hurt but there is a dent in my kitchen ceiling where the top hit it upon being expelled from the base with great force i would estimate the bang that accompanied the explosion was decibels i will definitely not buy another misto based on today 's explosion but even before this i was rather about the product anyway my advice save your money
i bought this in november 2006 and wanted to use it in my bedroom while i kept the thermostat down in the rest of my apartment to save money a plus for this item is its three settings but the thermostat is very confusing to use i ca n't say if the heater has saved me money or not however a big negative is that it gives off a lot of fumes the brochure says it only does this when its new but that seems to be very untrue it smells a little like kerosene combined with a funky musky odor and it emits this constantly i found myself getting sick chills in my hands feet and legs as well as shortness of breath the heat it gives off is very good a strong radiant heat that heats the whole room my room is about 12 ' by 12 ' but the fumes are actually a health hazard and i believe this heater should only be used if you are able to ventilate your room while you are heating it which kind of does n't make much sense
this is a very poor product what you are buying is a cardboard box that holds the disposable litter tray cartridge that you must buy for the automated system '' to work urine will soak through the bottom of the cardboard tray within 2 days and i have 1 cat ! the company wants you to stir the litter around every day so the cat urine will soak up in the crystals i bought this automated system '' so i didnt have to tend to a litter box every day i tried stiring the litter every day and urine still soaked through the bottom of the cardboard litter tray how pathetic ! maybe the system might be a little better if the trays were made out of plastic rather than cardboard avoid this system all together
maker claims that the product is dishwasher safe it is n't these bowls were to fill out a set of dinnerware however the first time things were washed a few grains of the dishwasher powder got on the dinner plates and etched holes in the glaze we returned everything we could incidently was very good about the return excellent service
this product is not what i expected i was hoping that my daughter would like to help me bake well she was afraid to touch the mat especiall when my fingers were burned by it i did't like how it worked
this item is not good and does not deliver what it promises it has no power and could not suck the air out of the bags i was very disappointed and would not recommend buying this product spend a few extra dollars and buy something different you 'll be disappointed too if you dont
this machine looks great but it does n't have the power to remove absolutely all the air when sealing a bag it also does n't seal well enough to keep the air out every package i put in the freezer came out looking like i had n't vaccuumed out the air at all not worth the money even at this price
got the scale and it looked pretty nice but it would n't zero so i sent it back for a refund it was refunded quickly bit was charged 3 bucks for the return
i was told to try the feliway diffuser by my veterinarian my cat has always suffered from an grumpy personality he is one of 4 indoor cats in our house and had started to urinate on the rug in my entryway i put the diffuser in the basement where the litter boxes are to make it a soothing positive environment for him combining the diffuser with a low dose of prozac has worked wonders we have an office in the basement too and that is where it is plugged in and he spends pretty much most of his time in the office sleeping purring and scrounging love off me when i am down there he never did that before we had only heard him purr maybe 4 times in all his 11 years and only when we practically had our ear near his throat ! i definitely recommend the feliway diffuser for anyone with a stressed ornery or cat keep in mind not all cats react to the pheromones but the only way to find out is to try the diffuser ! good luck to anyone needing this review it is really tough to deal with a problematic cat
i guess i 'm the only one who did not like this knife i have french german swiss japanese and chinese knives this one falls into the chinese variety i was not at all impressed with the quality of this knife when i compare it to a global japanese it just looked cheap i sent it back and ordered a golbal 7 '' santuko which cost more i just could not live with a chinese knife for 70
anyone with any rust issues should contact henckels from their website and get a replacement the blades are guaranteed to be rust free do n't mention the rusty spring issue or they 'll only send a replacement spring
i bought this unit and the timer stopped keeping proper time within a month of using it i also bought a timex digital timer and it was immediately defective i sent it back to the manufacturer and the warranty replacement they sent me was defective too ! whoever makes these timex timers must have zero quality control stay away and find something else
best thing about the timex timer is that it will accept a grounded plug but it is not very precise unless half an hour is okay for your needs it is also a bit difficult to move the time setting tabs to their on or off positions my wife broke a fingernail doing this not recommended
i bought the timer for a lamp and a hotplate for shabbat it worked well for the first 5 or 6 times then it completely stopped working
i bought this timer for my fish tank light for the first couple of months i had no problems with it but recently i 've noticed quite frequently that the light would not come on or turn off upon closer inspection of the timer i noticed that the time was not moving i would go to bed at night with it set to 1130 and in the morning it was still 1130 pm had n't moved at all i would fix the time and the light would come on and when i would get home from work i would check it again and guess what it was still 8 am sometimes it would have made it to noon or some other afternoon hour but it 's never the right time i realize it only costs 7 but my recommendation is to go with a different brand preferably one that works !
i am disappointed in the size of these bowls they are very small the largest being approx 1.5 qt the description does not state the size and i needed much larger they do seem to be made very well though
all the bad reviews are right on we may have to use this and put up the cash because i havnt found anything else but the filters only last a short while if cared for perfectly if not cared for perfectly you risk hurting your kids health
i picked up these sheets during a friday sale 69.99 i am pretty disappointed by the overall feel of these sheets out of the packaging they were stiff and rough i ran them through a wash softener and they were n't any better they seem to be constructed well the seems are high quality they feel like hospital sheets i 've bought sheets for 100 and they were night and day better do n't waste your time on these sheets they are n't worth the money
this spoon is definatley note the same quality as his other spoons and utensiles the slots cut in the spoon are left with wood shavings in them and the slots are not rounded i hesitate using this spoon with the shavings in the slots and will likey send them back or throw them out i do however love his spatchula and his wooden spoons and risoto scrapper thingy the handle is great even for me with my big hands
i expected a lot more from this machine now that i have it i still use my old 5 drip coffee maker the wife is still mad at me for spending our vacation money on it any impulsive male buyers out there steer clear the wife would rather go to the carribean
this sounded so promising a magic dispenser ! unfortunately the promise outweighs the reality the dispensing mechanism is so sensitively set soap comes forth when one 's hand is anywhere near it it leaks from the bottom and the spout and ca n't be cleaned without getting the battery compartment wet wet batteries of course mean that 's all folks back to the pumps for
heats quickly but puts out only small amount of steam need to move very slowly if at all to get out wrinkles then had to wait every few seconds for it to heat up again to get more steam terrible ! returned it immediately
i bought this item to use in lieu of my steam iron when my carpal tunnel flares up i have n't tried using it on a wrinkled garment only to touch up after ironing my complaint is that the water reservoir can not be fully emptied after use so water stays in it two small screws inside the reservoir are rusting after one use i used it about 2 weeks ago and it still has water in it i called conair customer service and they told me you have to use all the water by steaming it out there is a small plastic cap device and that 's the only means of putting water in or taking it out it 's the same type of cap used on pool flotation devices i 'm returning this because of the water reservoir problem it needs to be redesigned if it were actually good for removing wrinkles i would be afraid the rust from the screws would ruin my clothes
this steamer just does n't work i got it today and tested it out on three different garments and it did n't remove any of the wrinkles i am very disappointed
quick to heat up but takes a long time to steam a garment and still does not get most of the wrinkles out do n't waste your money
i got this because of it 's size so i could take it on trips being a guy i never pack things right so when i get to where ever i needed to iron most of my stuff i hate to iron so anyway right out of the box i balled up four of my best shirts as a fixed of the four before i needed to refill gets hot in about three min not bad but it only has two holes for the steam to come the way this is the frist thing i ever got without reading any reviews bet that wo n't happen again i give this thing a three out of five but because of it i have not trashed anymore of my shirts thanks to conai
i am very disappointed with this product it is not powerful enought to remove the wrinkles from clothing the only way i found to get it to do a fairly decent job is to stretch the piece of clothing downward as it hangs and rub the fabric with the brush on the steamer while steaming going over and over the same spot it 's like trying to iron vertically only with no support behind the article of clothing it does n't remove wrinkles nearly as well as an iron especially if there are any unwanted creases and it takes considerably longer than ironing since you have to steam the same spot over and over again i bought the steamer because it uses tap water and distilled water is a hastle to find when travelling but tap water eventually causes irons to leave mineral deposits on clothing instead of this product i recommend a standard iron or travel iron it 's easier to travel with a travel iron and just use a spray bottle filled with tap water to mist the clothes if you do n't have distilled water to fill the iron with the conair hand held fabric steamer is a waste of money that does n't do its job
i adore lenox tuscany classics collect them myself and buy them as gifts for friends i have ordered lenox tuscany classics or had them ordered for me from my wish list on amazon many times in fact i 've ordered all sorts of wine glasses on amazon and never had a problem last week however i decided to order these grand beaujolais glasses as a birthday gift for a friend the glasses never reached my house because ups reported them damaged in shipment amazon kindly offered to send a replacement and upgrade free to shipping once again ups reported them damaged in shipment amazon very kindly gave me a full refund at this point so that i could purchase the glasses locally in time for my friend 's birthday i have had a great experience overall ordering glassware from amazon and will order glasses from them in the future but there seems to be a shipping issue with these glasses in particular
i bought these glasses as a christmas gift when the box arrived let me put it this way the box was nicknamed the jingle box '' the glasses were in pieces the packaging of the glasses was horrible there was barely any cushion '' the shipping box was not much bigger than the box for the wine glasses the glass was in so many pieces that i was n't even able to remove the box from the shipping box because there were so many little pieces of glass that had fallen out of the glasses box i called amazon and they sent me a replacement that got stopped halfway here because the shipper said the glasses were damaged when they left the shipping center i called amazon again and they attempted to send me the item again i refused and had to argue with them to get my money back on top of that they then tried to charge me for the orginial glasses now at the same time i bought another set of wine glasses for someone else and those came packaged beatifully and they were in great condition when i got them if you are looking for wine glasses that you will receive undamaged purchase the marquis by waterford vintage aromatic red wine set of four they are a beautiful set and wo n't be broken when they get to you
linens and things had better towels ! ! ! ! ! at 5 dollars you pay 9 to 13 dollars at amazon then pay more to ship to you ! ! ! please do not buy this or other branded towels buyer beware amazon please cease and desist ! ! ! sell good items and stop robbing your customers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
thick towels but shed even after washing do n't wash with anything else but other towels seem to have good color saturation nothing special but better than most discount store brands i 'd probably pay a little more for better quality next time
i am usually very happy with hilfiger home products well these towels are run of the mill discount linen store quality there is nothing luxurious about them whatsoever i would expect to pay around 10 bucks for each they are not worth it i do n't know what the heck kind of towels some of the other reviewers were using before they bought these ! !
had to send it back not hefty enough for us felt like plasticwar
we 've had this set for years came with my husband so i 'm guessing he 's had them for about 4 years although we love the design i am very disappointed in the rust also one knife now rattles something has come loose inside apparently they come with a lifetime replacement so i 'm going to look into that good luck
one day my gorgeous russell hobbs toaster went crazy i started to research another nice looking toaster that would also satisfy my needs for a gadget i thought the breville toaster met my needs i did n't want the because i thought that there were times that i 'd like to toast long slices of bread i read the stunning reviews for the and the mediocre reviews for the and thought how different can they be '' let me tell you i bought the first breville put it on the ' setting and ended up with charcoal actually i ended up with a whole loaf of charcoal i kept trying different slices other kinds of bread and even different outlets but in the end i figured i had a bunk toaster however when i exchanged the toaster for another one i had the same trouble the toaster burned my bread everytime i used it above the ' setting whats the point of having 10 settings finally i exchanged the for the toaster perfection ! whoever did quality control for the model not so good buy the and you 'll be ok
they say this is so amazing because nothing sticks to it it cooks food better than regular pans odors do n't stick to it it 's easy to clean well they got 1 out 4 right at least it is easy to clean but it is impossible to coook almost everything in it because everything i 've tried comes out burnt on one side not even done on the other side on the cookie sheet everything around the outsides burns in the cupcake pans or the cake pan the top of the food cooks but the bottom does n't it is very hard to get smells out of it and with a lot of stuff you still should spray it with cooking spray or it does stick a little i 'm sure in some ovens and with certain foods they work great but my experience was n't so great
one of the '' rings snapped the first time i put it on my rolling pin
i bought the air filter for my smoking to clean the air i figured it would at least last 2 months but it only lasts for about a month and at 12.00 a piece it gets expensive to keep replacing the filters these are smaller maybe filters and i think they are over priced especially since they do n't last longer they should be priced lower but i suppose they were made for non smokers
i recieved one of these for christmas i would love to tell you how it works it is missing a plastic piece now to be fair i lost it in the confusion of christmas it must have gotten tossed i called rival to purchase a replacement piece what a joke i emailed response i called they do n't know what i am talking about even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual or if i get a rep who does know what the piece is they say they do n't have one to sell but if i want to pay to ship the unit back and forth they will replace it i have left voice mail messages for supervisors so instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece i will return this to the store as defective and get the money back they lose a sale the store loses a sale they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit do not buy rival products we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor illogical treatment
i used to love this kettle i 've had this kettle for over four years now and it has developed the same problem as some of the people who gave it reviews the electrical contacts have degraded over the past few months and today i could n't get it to turn on at all no matter how many times i twisted it around on its base i 've cleaned the contacts twice in the past few months to no avail maybe an improvement for all of a day each time looking inside the base i can see why the contacts die they do n't grip the metal ring spike at all but rather the ring and spike just rest on loosely sprung metal wish i 'd thought to inspect that before buying it there 's no excuse for such a bad design were they hoping for a repeat buy not going to happen
this is a very poor design i read the review above and thought maybe he just had gotten a bad product but i have the same problem i am very upset because i wasted money on shipping and time for a christmas gift
this thing does n't dispense anything i looked 9 times for something to remove or something like that but nothing comes out anyone have a similiar problem
garbage with a capital g ! where to begin ok the handle it 's my own fault for getting mad about that because i did read where the handle falls off but in my defense i figured surely the people over at bissell have heard about this issue so by the time i buy it will be fixed right wrong ! got this because of cat litter issue on a carpet do n't want to lug around the vacuum thought this was the up a little but it is so amazingly noisy which if i 'm gon na be that loud might as well get a real vacuum am guessing that bissell has sold out along with alot of the old standard companies in america and moved to mexico and this would explain why the products are sub par i mean you ca n't take a customer service issue if you do n't know the language so bissell i am here to help you out today ! your product is mieda been awhile since i lived in a latin country miami so please do forgive me if i spelled it wrong
i purchased this sweeper based on other reviews first of all the handle would not stay together no matter what i did they could have at least had the parts all screw into one another i found that the sweeper picked up hairs and dust but not the crumbs or dirt i had to keep going over areas where my son had crumbs and it still would not pick it all up i ended up having to get the broom and dustpan out like usual for 30.00 this thing should pick up crumbs i guess i 'll just have to find something else do n't waste your time and money on this
i was so excited about ordering this sad i know ! i liked the idea that this vac was and that it would allow me to do quick between regular vacuuming i was disappointed at how cheap the handle was and how easily it came apart basically in order to ship the thing in a small box the handle comes in 3 pieces you have to put them together the round tubes just slide '' into each other unfortunately the pieces are not threaded and do n't stay together terribly well if i had a really old vac that needed to be held together with duct tape that 's one thing however i 'm not keen on having to duct tape brand new things the pickup was okay but not great after a few passes there was still dirt on my tile floor it occured to me that i had not found the magic vac of my dreams so i ended up sending it back
i purchased this device specifically to juice wheatgrass first of all the suction cup at the bottom is worthless and the clamp is clumsily engineered and can only be used on a counter with a big lip on it which in my kitchen is in front of the dishwasher with the dishwasher 's door open which looks rediculous then in order to get any yield whatsoever one must crank then reverse then crank again to have anything come out of the tiny hole near the crank another design flaw on top of this it takes almost a whole '' tray of wheatgrass just to make two one ounce shots and that is with the compression cap screwed on the end something is wrong here they only use half that amount at wild oats with their champion juicers juice leaks out the handle out the front and everywhere else except where it 's supposed to go in the cup after doing this a few times and making a huge mess of grass clippings green staining juice all over my countertop and me and a tedious 20 minutes to set it up juice the grass and clean up it 's better i just stay with going to the local juice bar and spending the three bucks i know i should not be angry because you get what you pay for '' but geez this device was endorsed by the hippocrates health institute and i trusted that endorsement
please do n't buy this if you think you are going to be juicing carrots and apples and other hard vegetables because it is manual it would take anyone forever to get a 12 oz glass of carrot juice i can get a glass of carrot juice in less than 1 minute with my centrifugal juicer which is a juiceman pro but a centrifugal juicer ca n't do what this little juicer can do juice grass and leafy greens i have mixed feelings about this little juicer first the pros this juicer does a fine job of juicing wheatgrass the pulp is dry and it is not hard to crank cleanup is fairly easy it is portable it is cheap you get a slick dvd and extra parts in an emergency this juicer would be an ideal survivor tool now the cons the so called indestructible plastic auger cracked after the first two weeks of juicing wheatgrass i have to send it back for a replacement sometimes the crank hits the clamp or the edge of the counter that means i have to readjust the clamp to make sure it is on correctly not a big problem but something you have to be careful about if the lip on your kitchen counter does not protrude out far enough the clamp might not attach properly we actually have to open the dishwasher in order to have enough clearance for the clamp to attach under the kitchen counter i ended up juicing in my backyard attaching the unit to the side table of my grill because of the clamp the clearances and the drippy mess next the designers decided it would be best to reverse the threads of the end cap that means in order to tighten it you turn it counter clockwise this is the opposite of every standard thread on the planet it 's confusing in order to take off the end cap after juicing you have to use the wrench supplied and use a moderate amount of force i do n't like it also the hopper body is hard to slide off the locking base sometimes i really have to push it next the juice cup is very close to the handle crank you have to be careful not to knock over the juice cup as you are cranking not a huge deal but again something you have to put up with lastly when you slide off the hopper there are some drips because you must attach the locking base close to the edge of a counter that means some drips on the kitchen floor it can get messy i bought an omega 8005 electric juicer three weeks after buying this healthy juicer the omega is terrific and has none of the problems i have with the healthy juicer
i bought it because the price was right but this juicer is definitely wrong i lack the strength of a which is required to turn the crank and the patience it takes to produce any juice at all it makes a terrible mess and is annoying to assemble and disassemble i want a refund and some please
i actively dislike this dishrack as noted plates and bowls slide out because of open sides it 's too small for anything but very casual use do n't buy it if you do all your dishes by hand and contrary to the pr it does indeed rust water catches in the bottom and has nowhere to drain so you end up with an unsanitary pool of water under your dishes not recommended
i bought this exact same dish rack from another company i liked this dish rack for the stainless quality and for looks i was very disappointed that it has no sides therefore cups and bowls etc fall out continually nor does it hold many dishes at one time the drained water stands in the bottom tray and has to be emptied with each use the stainless steel will indeed last forever but not in my house
th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture but the one i got was made in china
i bought this grinder for my wife who likes extra fine grind and she was tired of holding the button on our current burr grinder and wanted an automatic shutoff the sounded good as our current salton grinder would accumulate grinds on the side shoot and had to be cleaned regularly stainless sounded even better when i received the grinder i looked at the parts and it looked like any other grinder the stainless part is the back cover and has nothing to do with performance then i pulled out the grind container and found that not only is it not straight through but has an extra bent tube that routes the grinds out the side of the grinder and down into the the container if the direct side outlet clogs this will clog even more i never even tried it but sent it back total misrepresentation by capresso
this grinder is really nice looking and the price was right so i was looking forward to incorporating it into my life but it kept turning itself off until my husband figured out that you could stand over it pushing the cover down to keep it going it was n't because we had not put the top on properly it needed the extra pressure i do n't know if it was a defect in our unit or in the design but i suspect the design and the grind settings were way off we had to use the finest setting all the time and even then the grind was a mix of crumbs and flakes sad ! you might as well have a 19 blade grinder after dropping it off at the post office we went to starbucks and bought their burr grinder for 88 much as i dislike supporting any chain store we are relieved to have a grinder that simply works
i was in the market for a burr grinder way better than blade and after trying the bodum antigua and cuisinart supreme grind i chose the capresso for it 's reputation reliability and value the capresso grinder failed to grind all the beans in the hopper does n't have a manual stop button unless you pull the top off the hopper while the grinder is in action thoughtless design and produced a fine coffee dust all over my countertop during operation it also has a huge static issue more than any other grinder i 've tried it is a bit quieter than the cuisinart but for 10 extra it 's not worth it i tried to return the grinder to amazon after 31 days i did n't open and operate until then and they informed me i 'd only receive 50 of my money back and suggested calling capresso customer service bad idea the capresso representative even agreed i should 've bought the infinity but that 's all they did so i 'm stuck with a grinder i dislike for the time being but will surely be asking santa to bring me a grinder that actually does the job
we purchased a hamilton beach cool mist humidifier for our daughter we go through one the filters are not sold in any locals stores and we can only buy them on amazon we usually have to purchase 6 at a time because the filters smell moldy after weeks now the price has jumped from to we are disappointed with the product and it 's permformance
hamilton beach has ruined an expellant product the cool mist humidifier ' by making the replacement filters so badly a big disappointment the filter gets moldy after a month of usage making the operation very expensive i hope they come up with a better solution i dont know what happend but the the latest filter has last all winter and still looks new
this has got to be one of the worst purchases i ever made after a few weeks it stopped spraying altogether and began dribbling '' today after less than 2 months it totally backed up resulting in olive oil all over the place
i started out liking this machine despite being not so fond of our former dirt devil screamer '' with the ridiculous belt changing routine the problems with this machine are try cleaning the pleated filter good luck ! and the exhaust blowing out the sides and then slightly downward blows around what you 're trying to vacuum up i am really surprised no one else has mentioned these two issues except for one person who mentioned the filter after just one use i had to knock the pleated filter against the trash can to loosen and remove the dirt no go so what are the options leave the dirt in there to continually clog it and then be forced to go buy a new one for 5.99 i honestly think this was the goal of dirt devil just to make an extra buck and if you 're trying to vacuum up pet hair and anything light weight watch it blow around from the exhaust as you go chasing it with the vacuum utterly futile it 's on the loud side too it is powerful but in the wrong way the goal is vacuum up the debris not blow it around your house
my wife and i do a lot of volunteering catering for the local elementary school we also direct our school pta 's hospitality services that requires large amounts of food prep on a monthly basis for all the events requiring food this rival slicer was relatively cheap and did a good first job making quick work on items that need to be sliced thin it 's good for the less skilled cooks out there who are n't skilled with a knife as well as for even good chefs that need to do large volume tasks with common items like luncheon meat ham or other cold cuts but it 's certainly no commercial hobart slicer and it wo n't produce the same quality of results the blade is quickly dulled if attempting to slice a roast to produce thin raw beef for say philly cheese steak or for vietnamese noodles also the design catches meat underneath which festers unless you disassemble the entire under carriage and remove the gunk underneath and disenfect i debated whether to give this product 2 or 3 stars and while it does come in handy for occasional home use i 'm experienced with a knife and have decent knives and professional sharpening equipment in the time it takes to break this out and slice and do the clean up i can this by hand about but that still would warrant 3 stars in my book but i had to lower the rating to because of the residue and trapped meat and sinews that the undercarriage causes i do n't know who designed it but being a very highly trained in mechanical engineering this seems like classic idiotic american design and get it out in the marketplace to stupid comsumers who do n't know any better rival is basically asking for a lawsuit not because people will cut themselves in this case but because the undercarriage traps stuff and to remove it you really have to remove components that are n't user serviceable and even then it 's still hard to clean ever since the first use i 've diligently disassembled the under carriage exposing some electrical wiring and cleaned out the residue left by the slicing process and yes the gears are plastic as another reviewer noticed if you use your slicer often the blade dulls quickly and the motor will work harder and this will damage the gears sooner what happens if you 're less mechanically inclined and do n't clean the slicer like i do well we had only one ant problem last summer in the house and it was because they found the mostly cleaned slicer boxed and placed on a rack then found the residue and proceeded to invite a million sister ants to come in and feast on it try as we might to disassemble and clean it more residue kept coming out and the ants would not relent and kept attacking the slicer i ended up doing a nearly full disassembly and submersive cleaning of the slicer components except for motor and to repackage the slicer in knew plastic with windex spray on the exterior of the box to neutralize the formic acid of the ants as a scientist engineer and volunteer cook i 'd recommend that people stay away from this product unless they like to disassemble the whole thing and then spend an hour wiping and disenfecting the thing after each use
i bought this slicer to cut my german bread that i bake myself the slicer worked good at first and i was pleased but after 5 months i started to have problems with it the machine started to make noises and the blade would stop spinning come to find out that the gears located underneath the blade are made out of plastic and the wore out so if you need this slicer for cutting bread like i do it 's no good now i 'm on the search for a slicer that has gears out of metal but it seems like there is none i 've contacted deni and waring and their gears are made out of plastic as well so if anyone out there has a slicer that has metal gears or has a slicer that has lasted more than 1 year in constant use please let me know i need a good one for a decent price
i reviewed information for 10 days before purchasing this unit i was shopping for price and features this unit had a great rating with its 130 watt motor and the average retail was around 90 however this unit was a huge disappointment i only had the unit for two weeks and during those two weeks i only used it 3 times i sliced one boneless cooked ham then a few days later i sliced up a pepperoni stick a few days later i sliced another boneless cooked ham the slicer worked fine like a dream '' the first time i used it it worked just ok '' the second time but by the third time i used it smoke was coming out of the motor it was running at about the normal speed and it was making a lot of noise there was no way to contact rival by phone the only contact option was email or snail mail i emailed them but got no response after seven days so i returned the unit this unit just does n't have the right stuff '' it could be the made in china '' sticker on the bottom i found this unit rival at for 59 4 tax 7 s h i guess you only get what you pay for ! next i am going to give the waring pro a try it is made in italy and comes with a 5 year warranty on the motor it 's available for 184.95 at
i had a problem with the container leaking and wrote them and i did n't get an answer so it just sits here not being used poor communication
i 've had several of these the spout in time will leak if you do n't mind a leaky spout this is a great product
this one is even uglier and more worthless than the tomato one i ca n't fathom using this without wretching
i purchased two of this item for a total of four i used them according to the instructions putting less into them than the commercials indicate within days all four had leaked not one kept the air out
i purchased a 2 qt wmf pressure cooker from the beginning the valve that closes by means of the steam pressure lifting a ' to close a hole in a rubber safety plug sometimes closed sometimes did not once when it did not i was out of the room burned pot burned contents fire alarms smoky smell in house for weeks when i finally found the office of the company and described what had happened i was told how great their engineers were and how many of their products had been sold for many years in effect i was probably lying but i could return the pot for their inspection i did ultimately wmf replaced it while i was shopping for a reliable product manufactured by someone else the guage on the replacement is now stuck open making it unuseable i still have n't been able to find the direct address of the manufacturer to ask for my money back although i suppose the probability of receiving 3 lemons are in my favor my advice stay away from wmf 's poorly manufactured product and insulting response to complaints
i would love to review this product but amazon first provided me with an incorrect delivery date then said it was lost but they took the liberty of placing a replacement order for me at no charge '' meaning no additional charge service and shipping have really gone downhill
i bought one of these a few months ago but unfortunately it spends a lot more time in my kitchen drawer than my regular garlic press here is what i do like about it 1. the idea of whacking an unpeeled clove of garlic in order to take the skin off more easily is great but this can be done with any hard flat object or even the side of a chef 's knife blade 2. unlike a garlic press the garlic twist gives you uniform pieces of chopped garlic while a garlic press leaves you with a flattened skin that you have to either discard or chop up by hand the garlic twist gives you uniform pieces unfortunately and this is where the garlic press wins out by my standards it is difficult for my hands to get the garlic twist going '' after the garlic has gone through a few destructive twists it is simple enough to continue until you reach the desired size of chunks however the first few twists are quite difficult to execute as you have to press the two parts together quite hard while simultaneously turning them to keep them from popping apart and jumping over the garlic rather than punching through it this problem occurs even with just one clove interesting idea but the classic garlic press is still my favorite sometimes i grate garlic on a ginger grater or a microplane grater for larger quantities the zyliss chopper might do the job but i 've never tried for the garlic twist however the drawbacks the advantages
i bought this presto 01370 stainless steel pressure from amazon on may 09 and i received on may 16. amazon did a good job on delievering i tried to boil water just like one of the customer review posted on the presto 6 quart model once for 15 minutes the pressure cooker itself was working fine but i noticed that there were many rusty spots formed and it also had brown color stain even though it 's supposed to be stainless steel it scared me off when i touched the rough rusty spots it seemed like the coat on the bottom of the pot peeled off or scaled off i 've never seen anything scary like this i wonder if presto tested this product before selling it to the public
our cats are n't into this at all the only use i 've found is to add a little lining to the bottom of their transport and to put it on top of their heating pads on those cold cold days when i actually turn the heating pad on the cats prefer comforters blankets carpets cat houses cat beds our laps etc to this there is no benefit to having it also we have two cats it 's the right size for the smaller cat the bigger cat is a bit too big for it
this teacup has a beautiful design but i was very disappointed when i received it the cup and saucer were much thicker than i would have expected for a china teacup ! it also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer i sent it back as i could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup
this kettle has the wonderful traditional le creuset whistle when the water comes to a boil it has elegant styling and a durable vessel what one would expect from such a respecable brand so why does the handle get too hot to the touch everytime one wants to pour a cup of hot water one must attempt to endure discomfort bordering on pain or fetch a piece of cloth as insulation surely heat conductive materials were not the best choice for the handle and why is the the lid fitted so snuggly that one needs place ones palm on the handle and grasp the lids knob with the fingers then squeeze to make a fist in order to get enough leverage to pull the lid off it was only after the knob finally broke off that i discovered that the threaded screw holding it on was less than 4 millimeters long after 4 months of use into the trash this kettle goes i expected better from a brand like le creuset
i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
price was a factor in buying but i wanted mostly for slicing bread machine bread the bit at the end of the blades get hung up in my presto slicing guide as the blades are too short further the switch is extremely temperamental and only works if you move your thumb around a lot i 'd return it if the postage packaging and trip to post office were worth it trying to dig up original cash receipt ! these people do not want return business ! they 've been bought by salton so they use this brand for junk
we love fiesta ware pottery this is a quality product made of tough clay with well matched durable glaze because of this and its famous assortment of sumptious colors i will buy it every time however when buying this product from macy 's i found the following to be true 1 items or colors listed as in stock and shipping the pizza plate for example get listed as backordered after you purchase and languish for months before the order is inexplicably canceled 2 items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality on average 10 of our orders included slay slubs glaze missing in spots and other imperfections 3 range of products severely limited 4 color choice from available range severly limited so in short buy fiesta ware a quality product made in the united states of charming beauty but reconsider macy 's as your amazon supplier
i purchased the orbi in april 2006 and two weeks ago the teeth quit gripping '' the can rendering the product useless considering most good openers last for years i think the fact that this one barely lasted one year says everything you need to know when considering to purchase this product choose something else
beware the dimensions of this item are not 12 inches as stated it is actually 10 inches i was told that the 12 inch plates are no longer available from the manufacturer
i 've bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use unfortunately this timer is an exception it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it 's round like a traditional kitchen timer it 's and has nice feet on the bottom the problem is the display it 's horrible for three reasons first the numbers are small smaller than any other timer i 've seen they 're about '' high half or less the size of those on comparable timers second the numbers are recessed '' or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface it 's dark in there and feels like looking down a well it desperately needs a backlight but there is none unless the light source is shining directly into the display there 's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers but that causes the third problem the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it 's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there is n't a reflection shining back into your eyes the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display not what i need when i 'm trying to cook it 's just not worth it since i have several other timers with displays i do n't have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight i 'd have to say it works very well i just do n't understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door
yeah this thing is a peice of junk its made out of extremely cheap card board ignore the lies in the product description that say it 's sturdy water resistant and leather like you also have to asemble it yourself and guess what it does n't fit togehter right because the dimesnions of the cheap card board do n't line up to where its supposed to snap together i 'd rather suggest lighting a 10 dollar bill on fire at least you will be more entertained by watching the bill burn then you will be by trying to put this thing together and then throwing it in the trash can afterwards hopefully one day companies will give us decent dvd storage however do n't give your money to this company trying to rape the consumer with their extremely junk
i ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel 's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button snap zipper catch or anything else that could possibly have snagged it it was not nearly as soft as i expected for the price either it was better than what you 'd expect from your standard hotel towel but it was n't any softer than my towels from the jc penny collection the redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet
as others have commented very poor workmanship the first pitter i had lost the pin on its third pitting round hammered it back in but did n't last the next season i needed one quickly but could n't find a different one so bought it again the pin was lost during the first use i have no idea why all local stores seem to carry just this pitter
its pretty poor quality however as shakey as this item is its still hase not fallen so it gets a two
given its price i purchased this laundry hamper not expecting a top of the line solution to my laundry needs but this hamper did n't even meet my lower expectations the materials are cheap and flimsy and under any kind of strain the screws have a tendency to come loose and it jerks front and back when you pull it across the shortest of carpet if you are going to use it for laundry look for something else more durable it might work for functions recycling
i think this product is terrible the first time i put my 40 golden retriever in it she tore through the mesh liner in 1 hour the time i was gone and got out it is not durable at all ! ! ! i am very disappointed
although the advertisement indicates that this pan comes with a lid you will not receive one and no one at customer service will know why not best look elsewhere if you need a lid with this pan
the only reason i ever ordered these pans is because they come with the ! ! pans this size are hard to find lids for for the price are n't worth it without lids this pan as decribed is to come with lids but i 've ordered them twice 4 pans in all still no so i 'm requesting a refund this i have purchased many of these pans from this company they are very nice well worth the too bad this page is i 'm ready when they get lids ! ! reason for only two stars is no lids the pan rocks
i used this once for about 5 minutes after i installed it to get some water for iced tea the water in my apartment is terrible but after coming out it of the filter it tasted the problem is that next time i turned the faucet on the filter shot off into the sink i reattached it making sure i had the threads lined up right and everything and tried again but the same thing kept happening after the sixth time or so the thing would n't even screw on at all there 's just not enough thread on the faucet for the filter to hook onto securely i 've problems with these things a few different brita and pur units in all but one place i 've lived so if you 're going to buy one make sure you 've got more than just 3 or 4 threads on the end of your faucet and do n't put any fragile dishes underneath the thing until you 're sure it 'll stay on
believe it or not there was red stuff inside ! ! ! ! ! today i unscrew my brita ultra faucet filter system '' well i was shocked to discover that inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing i called brita and was told that it is not the product since it is not even designed to filter out bacteria it must be the water long story short brita still pushes it product on people who does n't know better this product is poorly designed and drains bad therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one if you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out neither did i you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality
a very attractive kettle but the plastic holder on the lid broke off in a matter of a few months this is not a particularly sturdy kettle not recommended
if a kettle whistle is important to you this does n't have one the oggi zephyr is a sleek looking kettle however after a few months of use the plastic handle on the lid became lose i would have to tighten it with a mini screw driver a few times a week after a few months of tightening the threads gave out without the plastic handle on the lid i actually have to pry the lid off the kettle with a butter knife all of this happened in less than 12 months from the date of purchase i searched but do n't know where to find oggi or their replacement parts time to get a new kettle different brand
hello both the proctor silex 31115 toaster and the proctor silex 31117 toaster make noise when in use both products make audible sounds when in use it sounds like this tick tick tick tick
i added this henkels international 5 piece scissors when i purchased henkels high carbon chef 's knife the price for this 5 piece package was great considering the name value of henkels however the quality of product was not even close to the same scissor i purchased 8 years ago and surprisingly within 2 weeks they are getting rusty on hinges well what you are paying for is what you are going to get
all of the shears are very cheaply made the cutting shears for flowers are ridiculous small plastic lightweight not a quality product at all considering it 's hencklels '' i 'm very surprised at the poor quality you would be better off to go to your local hardware or office supply store for better quality and save some money at the same time
beware these scissors are low quality not what you would expect from henckels they are manufactured in korea and china with cheap uncomfortable plastic handles i own a genuine pair of henckels kitchen shears which i purchased at macy 's about 20 years ago they are still in great condition and work perfectly this is the type of quality that i was hoping for when i purchased this set unfortunately what i got was a set of cheap imitations i returned my order do n't make the same mistake that i made
i ordered this in september and still have no received it it is now the middle of november
no thermostatic control does not heat uniformly pizzelles are dark in some places light in others is most definitely not count on the first two batches becoming firmly affixed in every tiny groove even when oiled well have a firm toothbrush handy and lots of patience
i bought this safe less than six months ago and here i am searching for another safe box again at first the key was stuck and after many many tries i manage to loosen up the key and use it now i am using just security codes and whenever i enter the codes it does not open or close on first second attempts it opens after i keep trying pretty much it 's not reliable it can not handle daily use and over time wear and tear i have changed the batery twice and i only had it for less than six months
maybe it 's me but i can only get 2 poppings from each of these wafers they burn holes and becaome really thin after one use still looking for the ideal popper
i like this slow cooker somewhat but i have to agree it gets way too hot i have been using slow cookers now for years so i understand that cooking time will vary based on individual models food temperature and power source but really you ca n't use any lower of a setting than ! if you plan on cooking your meal while you are out is n't that the idea here you will return to a dried out overcooked disappointment i have even tried using extra liquid and meats with no improvement still overcooked and god forbid you get stuck in traffic ! you may as well just order pizza from the car ! as the hot dog man suggests it is good for some things mac and cheese in less than two hours comes out nice and creamy although it does stick to the pot regardless of how well you grease it up it also generates less heat than stove top so we use it during hot summer months to help keep the kitchen cool the removeable pot is easy to clean it better be since everything sticks while it is overcooking and the handles do stay cool the shape is nice also two stars for that overall if you are going to use the pot for cooking while you are out i would stay away from this one
i bought this a year ago because i commute an hour to the school i teach at and end up exhausted by the time i get home with grading to do as well i had to find a way to get meals prepared with minimal muss and fuss and needed an occasional break from microwave meals a slow cooker seemed ideal this model seemed to fit the bill large capacity convenient oval shape to hold larger items like roasts and an affordable price but i guess you do get what you pay for maybe my particular slow cooker was defective i 'll never know since the 30 day return window expired by the time i noticed the problem but this unit puts out too much heat even on the low setting i 'd come home to food with a decidedly burnt taste to them at first i thought that the recommended 8 hours on low for most recipes might be too long so then i started using it only on weekends when i could cut the cooking time down that did n't work either even on the low setting the food would come to a boil around the edges and that horrid burnt taste would permeate the entire meal i 'd also find that the edges and sometimes the bottom would have food stick and burn leaving a crusty black residue that had to soak overnight before being taken off also i never felt comfortable leaving it on all day because the bottom of the unit became very hot as well now it sits in my closet in my classroom every now and then i 'll pull it out to boil hotdogs for celebrations so it 's not a total waste of money but i 'd definitely not recommend this unit for anyone else based on my experience with it
this pan is not very far my least used pan it does n't sit well on a stove burner does n't have terrific heat distribution and takes up a lot of storage space it 's basically a small wok with a lid i love the line but this pan is a loser buy a large frypan instead
after being introduced to aebleskivers over a year ago my whole family fell in love with them never once owning any cast iron cookware i did not know of the various atributes to look for when purchasing one never buy one with a wood handle the cast iron may last a lifetime and then some however with regular use the handle completely deteriorated inside one year i am now cooking entirely with cast iron and am looking to replace the aebleskiver pan with a fully cast iron one griswold being my choice for this pan lodge looks ugly
i own a ceramic smooth top stove no where it the advertisement did it indicate that the aebleskiver pan could not be used on the ceramicsurface being unfamiliar with the pan i could not know in advance i was very disappointed
do not purchase any product from this seller i ordered the magic bullet via echeck i cancelled my order and was promised my money returned to my bank account the same day it was taken out it has now been 21 days since they took my money to date i have no product and my money is gone i have contacted these people 4 times and each time i got a different answer the first time they told me my money would be automatically redeposited in my account the same day the next time they told me days the time after that they told me it could take up to 15 business days the time after that they told me they would get it back to me as soon as possible by putting a rush on it '' it has now been days and still nothing they promise to call me back and never do they refuse to let me speak to someone in charge this product is not worth the hassel of doing business with such a poor excuse for a company
i bought this item for my daughter and was thrilled how much she used it to make terrific healthy smoothies but after 5 months the motor died i decided to buy a replacement because my daughter enjoyed it so much and the new one does n't even turn the blades great idea but they need to work on the quality and durability
the warranty for the magic bullet is awful if you get it as a gift hope that the person giving the gift bought it the same day they give it after several pictures etc i was informed since the gift was bought in october but not given until christmas had no warranty after october even though it was not used until the cost of the bullet at that time was the base can be replaced for 20.00 including shipping and handling many people who use the bullet states it only lasts a year if you buy it you are getting robbed it is amazing now they advertize buy one get one free seems like it saves you shipping and handling when the one goes
i have had my magic bullet for a year using it almost exclusively for mixed drinks others are right forget about using it for onions or garlic or peppers it chops them too finely into mush the pulse action quit working and i had to toss it the cup actually became lodged in the motor unit and i had a hard time getting it out have finally bought a tribest i 'll see how that one is
however it does n't work as well as my previous one from pavoni the cover on the capresso fits around the outside of the grinder so when you transfer the ground coffee to another container there is always some cleanup required it also takes longer to get the beans finely ground
this cutting board developed a split only 6 weeks after i got it it has had proper care and minimal use do n't buy it shipping was timely no problem there
i waited from april to july and they could n't get it in stock
that said the stainless nonstick fry pan has clearly failed the surface began to deteriorate long before any other pan we 've owned has in the past we received this pan as part of set and really it 's the only complaint we have about the set in general the rest of the pieces have performed beautifully and withstood all of the rigors of being cookware in a house with two accomplished and passionate chefs about a year ago we gave up on this pan and purchased the 'restaurant fry pan set ' from nordic ware 8 '' and 10 '' and they have performed much better than the version of the same and held there surface now four times as long at a fraction of the cost ! unfortunately this set is not currently available on amazon note i should point out in response to the weekend '' chef who gave this pan five stars that both my wife and i are well versed in the care of pans plastic and wooden utensils only let them cool before you wash them etc and the surface still deteriorated i 'm sticking to my guns no pun intended these two other fry pans have now lasted over four years without a hitch the lasted only with the same love and care
i love the idea of these but they 're a pain the plastic plunger sticks so tightly inside the plastic sleeve that getting accurate measurements is difficult i finally oiled down the plunger and that helped but it 's a definite i 've gotten the kitchen art stainless steel set in the hopes that it will work better
i have to admit that i love this set especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen ! so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy they feel great not the best flannel but nice all the same but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore later the fitted started getting holes so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning this is the set for you
i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thank
the belt comes off all the time sometimes i can use it for a few minutes but most of the time i ca n't even engage the brushes before it comes off sometimes it will rip the belt in the process i 'm on my third belt and i do n't use it very often we went with this vacuum over a dyson because although we needed something really good we did n't want to pay 600 for it big mistake it does n't even pick up hair as well as my old 100 vacuum cleaner stay away from this model just to be safe stay away from hoover altogether the fact that this item made it through their quality assurance tests really says something about the company
changing the canister which you have to do once for every large room is a messy undertaking even if you 're careful dust and dirt slide out with the canister dropping a mess onto the floor you just had to roll the hoover windtunnel over several times to get clean '' what a waste of money
i bought this vacuum cleaner less than a year ago and it has been in the repair shop more than it has been at my house the belt has broken at least 4 or 5 times and the system keeps breaking down when i took it in just last week to be repaired again the repair shop owner pointed to the back room and said over half of the vacuums they repaired were this model actually when the vacuum works it does a decent job although i do n't think i would buy a bagless type again emptying the container creates a mess unto itself ! so my recommendation is stay away from this hoover model
i wish i could get my money back from this i hate this vacuum for the following reasons 1. it is terrible at cleaning hard floors no suction 2 'bagless ' feature is losuy it is filthy to change the cannister and you have to change it every other time you use it 3. it clogs too easily 4. it breaksdown frequently 5. there is no auto rewind for the cord if there were fewer than 1 star i would rate it a zero i have a 20 year old panasonic thank heavens i didnt throw it away that does a better job is easier to use and has a good old fashioned bag ! ! run dont walk away from this or anything else hooover makes
i previously reviewed this product and had nothing but great things to say about it my opinion has now changed after owning it for a few months i have had nothing but problems the first thing to break was the self propel then the on and off switch quit working it just stays on to turn it off you have to unplug it now it keeps throwing the circuit breaker to my house when you plug it in brand new house it is still under warranty but hoover says that i have to take it in and they will only pay the bill if it is their fault i do n't want to take the chance in what they preceive is their fault this vacuum cleaner should be recalled i can not imagine it is very safe if it will not even turn off i just threw away alot of money and now have to go buy a new vacuum cleaner
hoover has a known problem with the belts stretching out on all the self propelled vacuums but will do nothing for customers stuck with them ! we must replace the drive and propel belts every couple of months rediculous poor customer servic
i ordered these as a christmas gift and although they were ordered before the holiday guaranteed shipping deadline '' they still arrived a few days after christmas also when they did arrive they were packed so poorly in the box that one of the crocks was cracked in half i ended up finding the same exact crocks at a local department store for a lower cost as much as i 've loved the books electronics dvd 's etc that i order from amazon i will never order these knowing that the packaging will not get it here in one piece it was a complete disappointment
i really truely wish i would read reviews and stop ordering from amazon all four pieces are broken one in tiny bits stupid me just opened the package from a month ago !
i ca n't really review this set as i have not received it and it has been over a month i 've sent 2 emails to the selling vendor not amazon directly and have not received a reply to either as yet the second email has been less than 3 days i like the other emerilware i have so far but this has been a disappointment as it was a long awaited investment
i 've used this colander for close to two years and am sort of surprised by the positive comments on amazon here i regularly use it for noodles stuffed pastas and more i 'm now looking for a new colander because the holes to drain the water are just too small so bits of food tend to get stuck in them and then it 's almost impossible to clean sure it works but the maintenance is too much for me
when i received the king sized topper i noticed that while still in the package the foam had a large crack the full length of the package thankfully i noticed before i unraveled the whole thing since it only fits inside the bag using a special condensing process i do n't believe that a quality foam would rip during the manufactures own packaging process amazon is great and made the return easy and free but still a waste of time i did give it two stars because you ca n't find any type of king pad for this price so i suppose it could be worth it if you could get one out of the bag whole
this memory foam piece was not nearly the same size as the other queen sized piece i purchased but other than that it 's comfortable
i was really dissappointed in the quality of the comfort clinic topper it doesnt state what density this memory foam is made of but it is not very supportive at all can not recommend this product at all
i used to agree with great comments of fellow consumers today i experienced very scary part of it when my wife kept the cooker for little longer than used to be less than we started smelling metal when we went to kitchen we could n't believe our eyes the bottom of the cooker melted and dripped down as molten metal it was so scary i do have pictures of it all and will be going for consumer protection on this item just thought of let you all future buyers and current owners know about it
i ordered this item because of the great reviews and was excited to receive it i received the first shipment damaged on both the lid and pot it was n't in the original box and the packaging was terrible i was sent a second pot and even though it was in the original box it had a 3 inch long scratch on the lid if i am paying full price for an all clad stainless pot i expect it to be pristine i have not received a response from amazon yet about a replacement i will give them one more shot
must write a review so i may save someone else from a sleepless night sheets were washed and still felt like sandpaper i literally had to sleep in the guest room i guess the old saying you get what you pay for '' applied if you are used to nice sheets you will hate these the egyptian label is very misleading it only take 1 egyptian cotton thread to qualify sheets as such watch to be sure that you are buying 100 egyptian given this from a sheet supplier but good food for thought
even though it says that these are sateen they are not i sent them back because they were n't and could find no indication that they were for the money though the sheets seemed to be nice and amazon did a pretty good job of refunding my money promptly
my hinge pin broke on one side during second use i was still able to use to with caution then within the year the second hinge pin broke now unable to use seems to be a common problem !
well it made good waffles but one day the hinge pins broke black decker told me when i called that they do not sell replacement parts for it i guess they want you to buy a new waffle maker which i will but you can bet it wo n't be black decker i do n't care if it 's just a waffle maker or if it 's a car the company that sells a product must stand behind it or i 'm looking elsewhere and that goes for black decker drills saws and other tools as well i 'm done with them
i own this product but on choosing a waffle maker for my daughter i did not consider purchasing another one i have had it a year using it about once a month it sticks and the light does n't always work it does make waffles but i will be purchasing a different one in the near furture
i use this every sunday the hinges broke after uses i will be buying the waring pro next
this waffle maker broke at the two hinge pins within one year of purchase parts are not available top is hinged to bottom with two small plastic caps that are poorly made at best unable to repair had to throw it out
got two waffle makers for christmas the list you know really liked this one because it looked nicer and the brand gave it the appearance of being more expensive we kept the other one as we like to make a bunch and freeze them so two would work fine well we had a problem with this one right away and my dh called b d and they sent us a replacement the replacement broke guess where at the hinge ! so we 've been using it for the last months like it is am currently shopping amazon for a professional one like i saw at costco
while i still love the pattern and the color was just what i 'd hoped i received two sets of these dishes and both had air bubbles in the glaze on the plates showing bare stone in tiny circles all over the eating surface while amazon was good to exchange and then return them and provide a refund i am unfortunately out a large promotional gift certificate and very disappointed with my experience with these plates
this coffeemaker has many flaws and is made of very cheap materials i bought it a couple of months ago the basket has a tiny spring inside that positions the lever properly in order to control the pause and serve feature the screw pops off very easily this happened to me when i cleaned the coffee maker for the first time before ever using it i figured out how to put the spring back in place but it pops out almost every time it 's cleaned also the lid to the carafe no longer secures properly i 'm still using this coffee maker while in the process of trying to find another one
this small fan is quite powerful but extremely loud as far as moving air it 's great but it 's sound is distracting even on the lowest of four speeds and on high it dominates the room also the remote should include the oscillate function had i been aware of the loudness of the unit i would have looked for a quieter fan
for such a little fan it sure makes a ton of noise the power is inconsistent and will start blowing harder and then softer for no reason it rattles like a car engine i would not recommend it for anyone i think it was a waste of money if i still had the box i would return it
like the other reviewer i do n't think i got the correct filters i did n't open mine but these do n't look like the typical filters with the familiar monitor on top i 've heard rumors that the filters with the monitor are no longer being produced but i hope not i chose to return this item and purchase a dented box item which i hope are the correct filters if pur stopped making the monitored pitchers i 'm gon na be very upset in addition the description on the box i received said that these filters are for water coolers and bottles it said nothing about compatibility with pitchers unlike the description update i contacted pur regarding the filter compatility the company says that all newer pitchers accept the however since june 2006 the filters no longer have the life indicator on the top '' and that sucks maybe it did n't work well but i suspect financial incentives for that elimination the email came from we should all complain
as of these new filters the life indicator do not fit in the water cooler they do fit other pur products if you call pur and tell them your situation with the cooler they will send you a replacement until the solution new filter is released since the standard ones with the life indicator are discontinued they were trying to make a good percent of their coolers dispensers pitchers use only one type of filter rather than have multiple filters there was a mistake on their part and if you call them they are very nice and trying to fix the problem as soon as possible
i bought a pair of these at target last week and went to install them in my pur branded water cooler made by kaz under license well after installing the new filters the first thing i noticed is that the orange filter life indicator at the top of the unit was gone i looked in the box and there is now a sticker that long story short is just there to remind you to buy new filters in 2 months okay while that may work for the faucet mounted kind which i also have i was not happy about that but the worst was yet to come when i placed the water tank on top of the filters which is what you do with the pur water coolers i could n't get the tank to sit on top and dispense the water properly the new filters stick up about 1 '' or so higher than the old design could i have installed them wrong somehow nope the idiots at pur did n't bother to notice this redesign of the filters made them incompatible with their own water coolers ! ! ! needless to say the tank fell of the top of my cooler cracking and then spilling water all over the floor and worse making me now in need of a new water tank i called pur they were closed called the next day and spoke with a lady who i swear knew very little english i explained the problem and i think she tried telling me that she had seen a memo about this and the solution was to send out 2 complimentary filters presumably with the old design she also instructed me to return the 2 new filters i just installed back to the store in this case target who i 'm sure is going to think i 'm just bringing back my old used filters this still does n't address the issue of the broken water tank which means i also need to call kaz and explain and hope they send a new one which they wo n't as it 's now out of warranty since i 've had it for about a year and hey look they are now discontinued buyer beware
it is also hard to fill it with water without spilling i will try to change location see if it helps so far no luck
i 'm with an animal rescue group so we have a lot of cats needless to say we loved the original drinkwell because it attracts the cats over to drink more water the new design of the platinum drinkwell is even better as far as attracting the cats however there are a couple of design flaws which are making these more work for us the reservoir can not stand up independently like the old one you have to hold it or lean it against something sturdy in order to refill it as it is curved shape additionally when we flip it back over no matter how careful we are water leaks out the opening to the reservoir and shape of it also do not allow for easy cleaning the only new feature we like a lot is the little gate '' in front of the motor area which helps us keep cat hair and fuzzies out a plus to any drinkwell would be if the top of the unit actually snapped into place and could not be removed by the animals we find the cats think the top of this is a new toy and they bat it all over the house we have had to remove it entirely which unfortunately only leads to more hair fuzzies being able to get into the unit as a rescue we refill the drinkwells 2 or 3 times a day and while we like the platinum one because it holds more water the fact that we ca n't stand the reservoir up by itself is a deterrent we wo n't be purchasing more of them and will probably go back to using the original version
tried attaching this to my tile sink splashboard never would hold tried reattaching several times and would consistently fall off
i 'm returning my pans because even though i sprayed them the cake still stuck in parts and did n't all come out smoothly plus the two layers were all warped and not the same shape my cakes still look bad and i 'm totally disappointed they do n't clean any easier than the metal pans there were also big airholes in the batter that i normally do n't have and this was a simple box cake
i was really looking forward to getting the shoes off the floor of my closet then i hung it up and started to try to fit my high heel into the compartments none of them fit apparently when they say that this accommodates heels they mean heels under two inches i am really very disappointed i am going to have to try to send it back
we are huge amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases however we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6 of these expensive wine glasses they fell apart ! the glass is tissue thin ! perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures one fell apart in my guest 's hand three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out we handled these glasses so delicatly i have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6
it 's a little confusing to use and it 's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it does n't automatically switch to the time going off but the worst is it 's whisper quiet i bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high if your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you wo n't here a thing
twice i had to return this product to the retailer the manufacturer placed a protective plastic tape on the front of the timer which when removed leaves a dull film on what should be a nice shiny plastic cover on this timer however most importantly the alarm that should be loud is so quiet you can only hear it if it is within one foot of your ear i contacted the manufacturer several times without a response never again !
the display instead of being simply clear plastic over the lcd it 's got a surface treatment to prevent glare that becomes steadily more difficult to read through in a period of months the case battery cover comes off at odd moments the magnet popped off the back the ui only fair i 've had 3 polder timers the first lasted until an accident took it out of commision several years since then i 've had two different models and they 've both worked poorly and failed very quickly this product is a stellar example of what 's wrong with many consumer goods today instead of making a product that we can pay a fair price for and use for years or more we get sold junk that fills up landfills
this timer is inadequate in two ways first the volume of the beep is too low and ca n't be heard more than two feet away secondly the led began malfunctioning after a few months and made the readout illegible i would n't buy this again
i was so excited to get this item after reading the other reviews i was impressed when i did receive it the quality is very good and it works great i followed the directions exactly for getting my two cats used to this new box however ater two weeks of trying they just refuse to use it and have found a corner to use instead ! ! ! ! ! i think it is just to small inside and they are not overly large cats nor are they timid in any way lots of money for something that should be more accomadating so very disappointed that this did not work for me i hope you consider my experience before buying one
i had wanted a cordless can opener and received this as a gift sadly it did not live up to the reputation of hamilton beach my husband and i have limited mobility with our hands he has arthritis and i have carpal tunnel needs herculean strength to attach the can to the opener push it down and get it to move around the can and ultimately open it and release i put mine away for good
the on off switch positivly did not work after about a week i got so disgusted with it i threw it in the garbage what i think about this product
this thing could n't even penetrate a large can and skipped about on a small can this is going back to amazon even though i have to eat the shipping charges an to hamilton beach remains unanswered
ordinary looking steel mug it does not have a lid which defeats the purpose of having doube insulation i did not find the quality of insulation that great either too pricey for the features it offers
i ordered 2 of these saucepans because i had owned them and liked them in the past i only threw them out after letting them boil dry and turn into molten lava the pans that i bought in september 2005 were manufactured in china and did not measure up to the past quality of those made in the usa and korea the interiors are oddly rough and the knob on the top of one of the covers has a sharp edge these pans are worth the 15.33 i paid for each of them and not a penny more
this is a waste of money it broke on the second use i took it a part to find out why and the entire locking force was applied via a sharp edge metal lever held in place by a in plastic pin it simply self destructed
this item sucks got it broke second time i tried using it simply do not buy this overpriced piece of plastic
item is unable to create a vaccuum or seal plastic bags customer service was surprised that i had bought it since i live at feet indicating that i needed special instructions which they sent by email after buying a special screw driver with particular size star tip and making the adjustments they said i needed to do it still does not work they said they would take it for repairs but 25 for shipping across country is unacceptable avoid this unit
i purchased this vacuum based upon how it was rated by consumer reports what a disappointment ! it is supposed to work well on hard surfaces it simply shoots out the back what it picks up in the front a total bummer since my house is all tile ! i would not recommend this vacuum
i recently purchased this fan to cool my bedroom have even the slightest noise while i sleep well i guess the fact that the fan does not make a sound is n't a problem even though that was one of the things i was looking for the actual cooling part is horrible ! ! ! the fastest speed on this fan is the slowest speed on all the other fans i 've owned ! i can barely feel it when i 'm lying in bed and the slowest speed is just a joke ! i think i would get cooled off more by someone blowing on me ! i would return it if i did n't have to take it all apart and fit it into the box and pay for shipping
this rosle product is made in china and its quality is very inferior to the utensils rosle is ruining their reputation with these cheaper products too bad that they will prostitute their name and image to make a few more bucks
this is made in china not germany it is an exuberant amount to pay for a product that did not cost much to make
i bought this on a popular online auction for 25 but i did n't know what i was getting into buy this only if you accept the following the good as the other writer reported the suction on the unit is superior esp compared to uprights with hose attachments the cord pullout and retract is again superior better than my electrolux the bad the hose and extension wands are proprietory that is do n't expect to use your old crevise and brush attachments with all of that superior suction you ca n't attach the crevice tool at the end of one of the wands you need to attach the crevice tool to order to put on the brush gimicky furthermore the wands fly apart unless you jam them in hard the unit lacks a do n't expect this to be of any value on carpeting the switch is small and could be positioned better no turning this guy with your foot the bagless design is it uses the same permanent coffee filter design that 's been around for years and years and you can see it clog up in no time the superior suction does compensate for that but you 'd think that after dyson had solved the problem one way others would be soon to follow not the case here but the real bug is that the release of the dirt compartment is part of the handle be real careful picking this guy up or the dirt will go flying all over and down the stairs ! who would think someone would pick the thing up by the handle however i should say that the suction is very good and if you do n't need carpet cleaning will never want to use your own cleaning attachments and use it under limited circumstances it 's not a bad deal for the price i use it for cleaning out computers all in all however except for those limited circumstances very soon after buying this you 'd realize that you should have paid a little more and gotten something you can use for the long term
this tool works well but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher when first obtained could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon now that i have had it a while it can be removed but it still troubles me that the handle which does get exposed to food when using ca n't be sanitized in the dishwasher there are other silicone that have handles and i 'd recommend those instead
i just purchased the new one i put it upstairs in the bonus room and bought another just like this i gave the old away when i purchased the new one shame on me this thing makes tea waaayyy better than the new ones the new ones would n't come close to melting all the ice therefore the first bit if tea was okay the last was way watered this one rocks ! !
one reviewer mentioned that rust spots occurred the same thing happened to us even though it just sits in our kitchen also the foot pedal broke on it after about 10 months why bother paying all that money if it 's just going to break and look awful you might as well just get a 15 one from walmart it last about the same amount of time the closing machanism is quiet however and it is easy to remove bags from the can
we bought it and returned it because of the caustic odor tried to clean it but the inside smelled strong it would be a good ottoman if you had a poor sense of smell we also tried buying another to see if the smell would be better it was not it 's hard to notice in the store with all the other smells
i did n't think i could be unsatisfied with a paper towel holder but this one was annoying enough to write a review the main rod would not screw into the base as described in the instructions maybe the screw hole was just faulty in this one but ended up having to use use my own to tighten the holder also when replacing the paper towels you have to unscrew the top knob '' which is not very convenient
i do not like this because when i pour every cup of coffee it has a stream of coffee that runs down the side of the pot and all over my counter and myself which is not good when i have to change shirts everytime i poured a cup of coffee it is the pouring spout somehow it leaks everytime my sugesstion is not to buy this certain 4 cup coffee pot i paid 25 dollars for it and now it 's sitting under my cabinet
i ordered the scooba thinking that this would be a great christmas gimmick for the family what 's better than a toy that mops floors trouble is the unit did not function would not spray the cleaning solution after about 3 feet of travel i called irobot customer service and they had me squirting water into valves and passageways trying to flush out the system no luck i visited a scooba internet discussion forum board and read all the posts and discovered that i was not alone it would seem that a pretty high percentage of machines do not function right out of the box being unable to get the machine to work i paid to send the unit back to irobot and they sent a new one the new unit did not perform either again called irobot customer service and they had me squirting water into valves and passages cleaning this adjusting that all to no avail this time irobot emailed me a ups shipping label to send the unit back i made sure that the customer service agent understood that i expected to receive a functional unit this time it must work right out of the box no excuses the third machine arrived at it too did not function properly it would dry up after about feet of travel i visited the web discussion forum again and did a lot of reading i have performed many checks and flushes with this unit finally discovering that the clean water tank does not vent properly forms a vacuum after a little water is pumped out and no cleaning solution will flow today i left the clean tank filler cap off when i started the machine and it seems to be working just fine when it works it works great my issue is why should i have to engineer workaround solutions for this machine 's shortcomings is it too much to ask that a 300 machine function properly striaght out of the box i do n't have to do carbureator adjustments on my new car i did n't have to engineer repairs on my new central vacuum system when it was installed new should mean perfectly functional '' should n't it by the way do n't order this from amazon if you get frustrated with the scooba and want to return the machine you wo n't be able to after 30 days read the amazon return policy ! my suggestion order from hammacher schlemmer you 'll pay a little more but they have a lifetime return policy no questions asked so what is lifetime '' for a scooba hammacher gives the scooba hammacher has been in the business for many many years they have an excellent reputation
bought one and did not work returned for another and also did not worked i called for assistance and tried and tried but ended returning it i also bought one for my daugther for crhistmas and told her not to even open the box and try it so returned too amazon had credit me for one robotic but still waiting for the credit on the one i bought for my daugther i bought 2 together and returned them also together do n't know why i am not getting the credit bad experience
i wanted this to work since i have a house full of unglazed porous beige ceramic tile floors with white grout no it was n't my idea it would be a job just trying to stay ahead of the dirt that rapidly shows up and the scooba did work at least on the superficial dirt the first time i used it unfortunately it failed on two counts it could n't get out the dirt and it broke within a few weeks to be fair not much else short of getting down on my hands and knees and attacking the floor with a scrub brush gets up the dirt either but the clincher is that after only a few uses the scooba 's cover stuck closed and could n't be reopened without a big struggle then getting it reclosed again proved almost impossible add this fight to the normal hassle of dealing with all the fiddly little parts in the device and it just became unusable oh and when it did work it tended to leak spots of dirty water and leave occasional black skid marks '' on the floor
i received this blender for last year it has some nice design features good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender does n't do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months
i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i 've tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it 's horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine
i have found the leaking problem for the fountain it is the filter it will somehow block the flow of the water so the water starts to accumulate and then you have a leak
although their coffeemakers do an excellent job of making coffee delonghi will use any excuse not to honor the warranty if anything goes wrong ! here 's my experience when i ordered my coffeemaker from delonghi it was backordered '' and took over a month to ship a little over 10 months after i received it the coffeemaker broke ! the heater coil went out and it would no longer make coffee since it had been over a year since i ordered it they said the warranty was expired despite the fact i had proof i had received it less than a year before i still had the shipping confirmation i explained this numerous times for a couple of months the various people i talked to kept telling me they would look into it '' but they never called back finally when it actually was over a year since i had received the coffeemaker when i called to check on the status of my warranty claim they said your warranty has expired you 've had this coffeemaker over one year there is nothing we can do '' i highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product ! i have a cuisinart now and it is wonderful !
it was hard to clean and use i ended up throwing it away after one week hated
i read the reviews on this coffee maker and put it on my christmas list anyway i had a lot of trouble getting the carafe lid off and on to the point where i wondered whether it was even supposed to come off ! after only a couple of uses the rubber seal on the lid broke i am going to call customer service to see about getting it replaced i 'll update this review if i have any luck other than that i love the look and compact design i 'm the only coffee drinker in my household and it makes piping hot coffee ! brew process is slower than average though
i have no complaints with the coffee maker however if you intend to use the carafe as a cup look elsewhere the lid leaks and you will have coffee dripping down your shirt a better design would be a lid you screw on similar to a hot thermos instead this lid 'snaps ' on and is sealed with a rubber washer i 've given this 2 stars since a company like delonghi should have figured this out before releasing the product remember functionality first then style
pros low price looks good in the package adequately slices and dices small pieces of meat and thin veggies cons flexible thin blade extremely lightweight and air pockets are too small to be effective veggies stick to the blade conclusion if you regularly need to use a santoku knife spend a little more and buy something with more and deeper dimples this is more like a disposable knife that you might take on a vacation or use in a pinch
the problem with this product is first the washable center plate is fragile and can break easily second the company 's customer support is terrible i ordered a replacement from the cuisinart webstore but they did not pack it properly so it was broken during shipping they refunded the price of the plate 10 but would not refund the shipping and handling 5.95 or the return shipping for the plate broken because of their poor packing 8.45 i would not recommend buying any products from them i am out 14.40 and have nothing to show for it except my original cracked plate i contacted several departments of theirs and received no reply
i asked for a popcorn popper for christmas and got this i had wanted an air popper but maybe i was n't specific when i asked anyway being a cuisinart product i thought it must be good also my cousin has an oil popper different brand that makes great popcorn so i thought i 'd try it steam collects in the making wet popcorn some of the popcorn burnt even with the spinner device because the popcorn stayed on the heat plate for too long after it popped it ca n't all be on top of the pile i still tried to eat the finished popcorn the unburnt less wet pieces and it had a terrible texture sort of too hard stale maybe but it was fresh corn plus even with lots of butter and salt it had sort of a strange taste sort of chemically maybe the manual even said something about chemicals needing to burn off during the first few uses and i even washed it before i used it because of the possibility of that lastly even though it is it was difficult to clean the cooked on oil off of the heat plate this is the worst product ever for so many reasons flawed design lack in ease of cleaning overall performace and the terrible end product ! i ended up feeding the popcorn to my dog at least she seemed to like it i am seriously shocked at the poor quality of this item i can not believe cuisinart let it on the market how on earth did it pass their test kitchens i wanted a popcorn maker so badly and now i am stuck with a piece of junk compared to that batch of popcorn i 'd rather eat the raw kernals straight out of the bag
we tried this popper after having the west bend stir crazy we were shocked at how bad the popcorn tasted with the cuisinart versus the west bend we do n't like how the coating comes off of the west bend but we are going back to it anyway
i assumed because this is cuisinart that this would be a great product and worth the 50.00 it has turned out to be a total waste of money the design is poor because there are no vent holes in the top of the popper so it fills with condensation which in turn makes the popcorn soggy im pretty ingenious so i thought that if i drilled a few holes myself in the top this would take care of the problem it did not help at all i tried several types of kernels to see if that would help the situation and it did not i use coconut oil always and did not change that i think because the surface area of the popper is much smaller then other poppers that contributes to the problem i never had a problem with the traditional dome top poppers and im going back to that style
after i drilled holes near the top of the bucket as others have mentioned the popcorn was quite good and provided enough for our family of five to eat the problem we have with this unit is that it overheats after one batch in reading the owners manual it even says it will ! and there is a that turns it off until it cools down if you only want to run it once and you can drill holes in it i guess it 's okay if you want to supply a family with popcorn for the duration of a movie find something else that works when used continuously
received this as a gift some time ago and after my son told me how much better fresh popped corn tastes i bought some popcorn and buttery popping oil both orville 's then i broke out the popper and followed manufacturer 's instructions to the letter it popped the corn quickly but it smelled funny and the popcorn was tough chewy and tasted very stale i thought maybe it was because it was the first batch so i popped another same results called my son to ask what i could be doing wrong but he had no idea he pops his on the stove i was planning on trying some different oil and popcorn but then i read these reviews so i wo n't bother at least now i know it is n't just me big disappointment
just like another reviewer wrote my black nylon head melted in front of my eyes when frying an egg the description says this product is heat resistant to 400 degrees but i just do n't believe it i really like the flexible angled handle so i 'm going to try the stainless steel head and suggest everyone else do the same !
oxo has always been one of our favorite kitchen implement manufactures because of their high quality not this product incredibly the first time this was used to make pancakes the edge of the spatula blistered and melted we tried it on hash brown potatoes with the same result a call to oxo customer service elicited their willingness to refund the purchase price only if we returned it which simply is n't worth the time and trouble maybe it 's only the blue ones this happens to we 're rethinking our opinion of oxo
it fits in the cup holder and holds a lot it 's plastic inside and does n't keep coffee or tea hot for very long and because it 's metal outside you ca n't put it in the microwave it 's ok for a short drive to work but not great for long drives where you want you coffee to stay hot
i got one of these attractive looking boards and treated it with a wood maintenance product the board sucked up very little wax compared to my other boards after a good meal with friends i was prevented from doing the dishes right away and the board ended sitting for two days before cleaning by this time it had collected mold that is situated deep into the surface of the board and which i regard impossible to remove i have n't and did n't experience this with any other board the board looks good without mold and is very resistant to cutting marks but if you decide to get one you should probably make sure to clean it right away after any use i do not know if this is a general characteristic of bamboo or a quality of this particular board i would have appreciated a word of warning or a useful guide as to how the board needs to be treated differently from boards made of wood for my next board i will probably try to find an board made of american maple american maple is significantly harder than european maple tor
i am so disappointed in this cutting board the first one i got looked like it had been gouged and used i got a replacement easily enough but this one cracked all the way down the middle the first time i used it and washed it i hand washed with a mild soap and water immediately after i used it and even rubbed it with mineral oil when i took it out to use again i discovered it had a crack in it very disappointing and what a waste of my christmas gift certificate do n't buy this it is junk
i bought this dish about 6 months ago and use it on a regular basis however when baking some fish at moderate oven temperature 375 it split into two separate pieces with a loud crack '' there was no extreme temperature changes either go figure
well after having this for almost a year i honestly am sorry i bought it because i am finding it just is n't a necessary appliance for my kitchen my mom has one and just loves it she cooks all her chickens in it small turkey breasts and larger sized roasts i have cooked my chicken in it and it did turn out well however i continually needed to check it to make sure it was n't burning on the bottom it is much easier for me to put the whole chicken in a cooking bag in the oven in terms of the slow cooker portion of the roaster the things that i have tried to slow cook i have n't used enough of we 're a small family and the food has n't cooked all day like i would want it to without being burned and dried out as a result i ended up purchasing a 4 quart slow cooker which i just love and the portions i use in it are the right size for our family this appliance is big and you need to have enough room to store it i think if you have a large family and are cooking large portions this should work well for you
i love the way this works but the second time i used it the no stick coating starting coming off in my black strips of plastic stuff when i wrote to nesco about it they sent me a price list to buy a new liner i do not believe i should have to pay for that when i only used it twice also i asked them several times what the coating was and could it be harmful if it came off in food only after threatening legal action did customer service tell me it was harmless i hope that is true but now i am reluctant to use this cooker and surely do n't want to pay 18.95 for a new liner that might do the same thing again it would have been nice if they had offered to replace it i am going back to rival for a slow cooker now
i bought these sheets in confidence after reading all the great reviews but when i got them they did not feel soft at all so i did like many said and washed them a few times they got a little better but now after no more than 8 washes they are pilling really bad and it feels like i am sleeping on flannel sheets i would not recomend these to anyone
have only had these sheets for about 5 months and they have worn out and gotten scratchy where i sleep dissapointed
this product is not what i expected i was hoping that my daughter would like to help me bake well she was afraid to touch the mat especiall when my fingers were burned by it i did't like how it worked
i must say i 'm a big fan of calphalon i own several pots and pans from both their stainless steel and contemporary series and i love them and highly recommend them i bought these knives assuming that their quality in cookware would translate into cutlery i ended up returning them after several days here 's why pros absolutely beautiful knives that are well crafted with very rigid stainless steel more rigid than henckels and wustof the santoku knife is a nice addition i loved that the steel construction went all the way to the end of the handle the steel provided with the set supposedly actually sharpens the knives as opposed to only honing them who knows cons 1. very heavy compared to the german knives these are not agile at all and can be painful on the wrists especially when using the very substantive chef 's knife i thought the weight would add to the cutting ease but it really did not on top of that the weight was unevenly distributed making the knives feel unbalanced 2. short handles as you progress to the smaller knives the handles got annoying short this just compounded the weight issue 3. no sharpness advantage i ended up purchasing the henckels twin cuisine set of knives as they were similar in design and also has a santoku in the set ! to the katana series i noticed that even though the vg japanese steel '' was supposed to be even sharper and stronger than the german steel i felt like the henckels knives were still sharper and cut through everything with much more ease 4. slightly harder to clean the integrated bolster design makes it slightly hard to clean since any sponge you use against the blade tends to snag on the sharp end of the bolster all the other german knives have a rounded bolster this is by far the least important con all in all i think the henckels twin cuisine knife set is extremely similar in price and design and additionally does not suffer from the deficiencies of the katana series knives
not worth it honestly for the price it was not what i thought it would be because i was hoping it 'll be similar to count the fabric is like nylon and created a lot of static i think it is good for sofas or futons and the burgundy is a nice color
very unhappy with sheet set i hate them so much i wont even put them on bed ill probably throw them awa
i gave these one star because i had to these sheets are garbage the colors will wash out after the first washing my blue sheets now have big permanent peach marks in them and the corners of the fitted sheet have split i have only had them for a month love the way that they feel however the quality is terrible
my mother gave us our rival electric white mountain ice cream freezer which worked well for three seasons yesterday i made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner the result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out i filled the stainless steel container with water which seeped out overnight apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making online i discovered 1 that mother paid much too much for this item and 2 there seemed no way to order replacement parts as in a new tank can you help
i was very disappointed with the quality of the juicer i purchased the handle would not stay up and it was easy to crush your fingers bad if young children were using it the top would not stay in the rubber feet left black marks on the formica poor quality rubber i sent mine back for refund the company but they would not respond sign of a poor company
broke after only a few months of mild use junk save your money
we puchased three of them the first two burned out '' after about 45 min the first time they were used the other one did the same the second time used would certainly not recommend it
this opener does not last it cuts all the way around and fails at the end of the cut leaving a shred of metal that must be twisted off this endangers the user i have used three and all of them fail after used a while a new cutting wheel would solve the problem burt where can you buy them
well its wood its hard to clean but i knew that going into it ! ! wont do it again
useless water and becomes unbalanced and tilted withing 2 of money
i was so disappointed when i opened the package the sheets are literally see through and as rough as burlap horrible quality material on the sheets the comforter is nice my son loves it i am going to end up spending more money on solid colored sheets that are softer and more comfortable i would never sleep on sheets like this and do n't expect my child to so sad because my son loves star wars so much shame on whoever would manufacture such an uncomfortable product for children ! i have yet to wash the comforter i am afraid to i do not recommend this set to anyone unless you have another use for the sheets it is not worth 60 by any means
the comforter has great colors and the lightsaber duel looks excellent however as many of the other reviewers noted the materials used are lousy as parents we want things our children love but we want them to be comfortable these sheets are definitely not warm cozy and comfortable i would prefer to pay a little extra for quality and comfort for my kids
i received a broken crockpit returned it for you to send me a new one unbroken and never received it did n't get credit on my statement for my return either i have sent you several unresponded to notes on this topic
the tank size which is intentionally omitted from the product description is too small for large jewelry or sunglasses to find a real ultrasonic device search the web for cavitation jewelry cleaner '' this is an amateur ultrasonic cleaner in a designer '' plastic package designed for sale to those who have n't done their homework on ultrasonics
the pan came with a small scratch in the center i have used it once and it worked pretty well and cleaned up nicely i was looking for something other than aluminum causes alzheimer 's and causes cancer when heated i wish i could have seen it first i think it will be okay has a dip all around the edge and when i made oven fries the oil gravitated to that low area the potatoes cooked good anyway too much trouble to return it
although it may be too late for some unhappy buyers the adhesive can be easily removed with goo gone goo gone is made by magic american in cleveland oh if necessary goo gone can be poured onto the label and you can peel it off any adhesive that does n't come up with the label can be wiped off with goo gone since i do n't own the pan i gave it a similar rating as those previously posted
i bought this item to store toys the material never unwrinkled so it does n't look like it does in the picture it looks like it was stuffed in a closet for a few months it was 10 but worth about 2 really poor quality do n't waste your money
if this was n't such an inexpensive item i would return it but the hassle is too great
we love fiesta ware pottery this is a quality product made of tough clay with well matched durable glaze because of this and its famous assortment of sumptious colors i will buy it every time however when buying this product from macy 's i found the following to be true 1 items or colors listed as in stock and shipping the pizza plate for example get listed as backordered after you purchase and languish for months before the order is inexplicably canceled 2 items that are seconds quality being sold as first quality on average 10 of our orders included slay slubs glaze missing in spots and other imperfections 3 range of products severely limited 4 color choice from available range severly limited so in short buy fiesta ware a quality product made in the united states of charming beauty but reconsider macy 's as your amazon supplier
a very short does not give me enough information or instructions as to how different cutting tools perform etc i guess i 'm just to old to be dealing with this at my age i will be sending it back asa
i have owned and enjoyed and recommended henckels knives for years naturally when i needed high quality steak knives i went to them first i have owned this set for less than 6 months tonight while merely cutting a pork chop the blade that i was using snapped right through the steel near the handle there was no unusual force being applied just an ordinary cut through tender meat i have had this happen with lesser knives but never expected it with this set i had read a review speaking of this problem at the time i ordered my steak knives but decided to disregard it and go with my experience i hope you will listen and not waste your hard earned money
my experience is the same as the other two reviewer this crockpot has a design flaw that the condensation leaks out i will not leave anything cooking in this crockpot while i am away too dangerous
bought this crockpot from a local dept store hoping to enjoy it 's nice size and color and the good crockpot name nope as another reviewer stated the lid is poorly designed moisture boils and sprays around the outside of the lid and causes the lid to bounce around drives me and my dog crazy no way would i feel safe throwing something in it and going away for even a few hours much less a whole day in this day and age it seems cheap products and profits are more important than long lasting quality and craftsmanship shame shame on crockpot !
the oval rival crockpots have a design flaw the lids do not properly fit this causes condensation to leak out of the pot and onto the counter i am not able to leave this on if i will be leaving for the day because i am afraid that all the water will ruin my countertops and flooring it really creates a large puddle ! i contacted the company but they did n't respond i highly discourage the purchase of this product !
we ordered this bed for our miniature dachshund she was very interested in it but every time she crawled in it would tip over when she got to the back to turn around the sides were just too rounded and she could n't get out without help
the idea is good but the collar too easily slipped off our cat 's neck
i bought one of these for my small cat when i looked the collar over i found i was able to pull on one of the two adjustable portions and the collar tightened while that is good for adjusting size it also would choke the cat if just this part of the collar was snagged i tossed it
i love the look of this collar and the idea is great that it pulls loose it gets caught on something so the cat can get away but i find that it comes loose on its own ! ! i bought two and they both have the same problem i have to it twice a day which obviously makes it useless i 'm tossing them in the garbage and going back to the other kind i had
there is no substitute for japanese steel anything based on yoshkin steel i recommend global german steel is decent do n't get me wrong but it 's i 've gone through 2 sets of henkels and was unimpressed i 've had my globals for years and ca n't even consider a substitute these things are so sharp my girlfriend is too scared to even touch them
while these pans look like quality pans potential buyers should know there is a big discrepancy and gross misrepresentation in the advertising copy on for this set of pans up to 500 degrees fahrenheit '' is completely false i received this product yesterday and read the user booklet that came with it and it states they are only to ! so today i called revere to verify this info and they said that the copper ellipse pans are only to be used in an oven up to i purchased this set because i wanted a pan that would go into the oven specifically for a tart tatin recipe that goes to i am upset at the time this has taken to receive the wrong product
the edges hold in water and it rust extremely fast
i had this fan 2 days i was changing the fan setting when there was a snap and a flash of light from the display similar to a bug zapper i was lucky not to get shocked however it scared the out of me the fan kept working but could not be shut off or adjusted i had to unplug it do not buy this fan
like several other reviews i was very dissapointed we have looked at several machines from francisfrancis ! gaggia ascaso while these are certainly more expensive machines the machine we are replacing is on price parity with the breville my observations pros solid well built construction long steamer wand this allows you to rest your carafe on the unit and steam your milk while you put away a dish or toast a bagel simple to operate and pleasant to look at nice ergonomic features like a storage compartment for the accessories under the unit removable foam wand etc cons it fails horribly at its core function making good expresso and your milk i use pods and the machine takes very long to pull the shot it splattered all over due to the funky way they try to create '' crema and the ultimate product was weak bitter the steam was very weak took about 30 longer to warm up my machine than any machine we tested and it was very inconsistent in how much steam it injected the machine wastes a lot of water they are proud of all the priming and purging features but as it steams and belches it makes quite the mess i found myself reaching for a sponge and towel several times during the brewing process net this is a great machine architecturally but a horrid expresso maker if this kind of coffee is acceptable to you there are a thousand less expensive brands that will do the trick for the price the performance must be better
i 'm an only drinker and have owned a variety of machines over the past 20 years i 've had this one for less than a week and it 's going back to the store for refund after having read all of the reviews here is exactly what is correct and what to expect if you 're not a cappucino conniseur please do n't bother writing a review pros 1 built like an absolute tank beautiful style and construction this does not mean excellent engineering just means not 'flimsy ' the thing weighs like 40 pounds 100 durable 2 short wait time for water to get hot like this really matters compared to a machine this is thermoblock a boiler takes what 7 minutes and this one takes 4 are you that much in a rush for a cup takes 20 minutes at starbucks cons 1 i have a pavoni the best pump machines in the world you ca n't come close with the breville at best with fine ground espresso i can get slightly rich coffee while the machine pumps for 5 minutes 2 the filters stink the on them is only there because the machine does not produce enough the filters leave a soupy mess and not a dry puck a puck is indicative of a boiler system makes you want to drill holes in the bottom of the filters as is there 's only a single pinhole that gets clogged 3 what steam when you first switch to steam mode it spits out a nice second stream of water and whatever you call the air pithing out you can put your hand up to for a bit without scalding you 're better off making foam using your lungs and a straw then nuking it in a microwave it hardly produces any foam 4 the hot plate on top is not a hot plate it 's a plate my heating pad for my back is warmer overall if you 're an inexperieced cappucino maker who thinks dunkin ' donuts hung the moon get this machine otherwise it will end up being returned or being a workshop anvil
i returned this item i was looking for a very fine strainer while this was actually a pierced metal strainer making it too coarse for my needs otherwise the unit was of good quality the holes are much finer than a typical collander so it could meet someone else 's needs better than mine
we received this microwave as a wedding present and it really was a good microwave the toasting function is handy and seemed to work well it is a bit small inside but that was ok since it 's just my husband and now now that we 've had it for 2 years it 's starting to spark while it 's running and i am scared it 's going to start a fire in my kitchen ! i know others have had this problem and i 'm actually shocked that sharp has not recalled this item because it really poses a fire hazard so here 's what i think great but does n't work long term and for the price you would expect to keep it longer than 2 years oh and if you decide to cook popcorn be sure and take out the turntable and try to cook it on a bowl or in a plate as long as the bag does not touch the top or sides it should n't burn i have had much more success with it since i started doing that
the sharp warm and toasty microwave is a clunky hybrid of toaster and microwave it takes 10 minutes to toast a muffin the software is buggy i ca n't program it to toast a muffin to the end but must get up and half way though the interface is clunky it has little relationship to most appliance interface design so must keep manual handy plus ours just died died after only 2 years of moderate use the user manual has no troubleshooting section like nothing will ever go wrong neither does their website so i tried to contact sharp through their website and after filling out all my info and problem details found their site does n't work with firefox the end
we bought this microwave to accomodate our small counter we figured instead of buying a toaster and a microwave we could just get this one appliance wrong although it does toast and microwave it does neither well toasting takes forever and you never get a toasty brown '' color the surface of the just gets dried out it does microwave but it takes a long time the biggest disappointment though was that it does not work at all on microwave popcorn most of the kernals remain unpopped while those that do pop burn as does the bag after a few months with this product we 're buying another microwave
the concept is brilliant and i really wish i could say that this unit is a good combination because i have limited kitchen space unfortunately it only has 600 watts of microwave which means it is very slow at defrosting or microwaving a potato as for a toaster it is a failure if you repeat the process two times you will get bread with a very slight brown to it but it is not toast i returned the unit and do not think this should be sold as it does not perform as stated
the picture makes the exterior 'look ' like it is but it 's actually a cheap thin mixture between fabric and plastic the heat barely radiates through and only when the cat is inside although the bottom of unit is always toasty the cord is the best feature very sturdy and assuring would not suggest this product over priced
these sheets are very heavy and stiff they feel a lot like canvas also they do not fit deep pockets mattress at all i returned min
these sheets are aweful they are so wrinkly and stiff i should have listened to all of the other reviewers when they said the same thing trust me they 're not worth the money not matter how good the deal sounds
very satisfied in receiving the holmes fan before the scheduled fan was very easy to put together and take apart the noise level was too loud it does not tilt more than a inch and oscillates only 5 '' left and right of center i had to return this item i do not recommend this fan
it worked for one week and then part of the heating element went out this caused the egg on that side to spill over into the water this was a poached egg even though this is a nonstick surface i could n't get the egg to come off i tossed the unit i had a cuisinart for seven years before it quit will buy another cuisinart
the silicone splatter screen itself is about twice as effective as a traditional splatter screen but the removable handle is very unstable and does not stay attached to the screen this design flaw basically makes the device unusable the label accompanying the splatter screen notes that the handle is specially shaped for comfort and to assure a good grip the removable handle does not heat up during cooking the removable handle makes the screen easy to store '' these statements may be true but if the handle does n't stay attached to the screen then using the screen poses a threat of grease burns or worse frankly i do n't feel this device rates even one star
cheap rusts worthless turns out miu france is just the name of a company in hong kong selling products that are made in china
if you actually need to time something to the minute do n't buy this product you ca n't line it up accurately and when you do it is very inconsistent i should have gone digital but i wanted soemthing my kids would be able to set too
this lamp would be gorgeous if it was made as described there is nothing bronzelike about it it is painted a dark yuck brown three very obvious sections make up the pole it reminds me of an old pole lamp ! the textured '' part is occasional comblike scratches in the metal before it was painted the yuck brown it is a sleazy of what was probably a high style lamp
after using this product twice i would have to say that it does not work you are supposed to leave the solution on for 3 minutes before washing items and i did this the time the time i left the solution on longer and i still have hard water stains and salt build up i honestly get a better clean from using dishsoap
this product is attractive and works efficiently however my unit produced toxic smelling water the first 5 times i tested it out i will try a metal electric kettle next
owned for 6 months and several times i ended up with coffee all over the counter and floor coffee got under my laminated floor and now i need to replace several sections of the floor its home is now in my garbage can
i got this coffee pot last christmas and it worked great for about three months now it takes 45 min to brew 8 cups and it sounds like i live by an airport i have cleaned it but that is n't the problem i did have to buy a new one since i could n't deal with the noise or waiting so long for a cup of coffee
i returned this item as it was not the bunnykins children 's set that i expected this set is no longer manufactured in england it now comes from taiwan the quality and the coloring is not the same i am very disappointed that this set is no longer made in england i will not purchase another one i am willing to pay more for english goods i am tired of cheap goods
i had a hoover windtunnel supreme bagged upright vacuum in 2000. it worked very well until sometime in 2003 when i replaced it i have a dog and two cats so i need a good vacuum i replaced it with highly rated vacuum that also worked well for three years until it started going downhill so i got another hoover windtunnel supreme bagged upright this new on is a piece of junk i 've had it two months gone through 2 belts and i 'm ready to throw it in the garbage it 's lighter weight than the last one and does n't seem to work as well it does n't even hold together well for example the end keeps coming off of the handle as i vacuum did i mention it just does n't work very well because it really does n't
i ordered two of these microsuede comforters one in green and the other in brown i was disappopinted in both the comforter is not plump enough to add richness to the style tufting can barely be seen i ordered queen sizes but they seemed more like full maybe if i had ordered the king size i would have been more satisfied
this product is very sturdy and seems to be well built but i wound up returning it for a refund each time i used it the gearbox above the ice cream container ground lots of metal flakes into my ice cream i have read reviews of this machine since i returned it that say the same thing it is a neat looking product that freezes ice cream well but unless you like to eat chunks of metal with your ice cream i would find another machine
two years ago i purchased this ice cream freezer for 130 on the web my wife and i loved the idea of kids taking turns cranking the handle but the very first time we made ice cream we found that the crank would jam incessantly if i pressed in on the handle in a certain way while cranking the jamming was reduced a bit but this was a nuisance if one did not apply force in just the right way the thing would jam again so much for friends and kids enjoying taking turns at the crank ! the second time we made ice cream the jamming was even worse and we noticed that metal filings were dropping down from the gear mechanism and were making their way into the ice cream when i took the gear mechanism the crank assembly frame '' apart i discovered the problem the gears inside are designed and manufactured badly the gears are not held in place but rather have about '' play that is a lot of play when the gears drift apart they jam the gears in our unit were badly gouged after only two uses ! the gears seem to be stamped from powdered metal the entire problem could have been avoided in the manufacturing by simply using a plastic spacer on the shaft that holds one of the gears but this was not done when i called about warranty service i was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me that never happened the next time i called some months later i was told that there was no record of my earlier call again i was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me about a week later a replacement handle arrived not a gear mechanism the third time i called about warranty service i was informed that gear mechanism is not actually a replacement part so that i should never have been told that one could be sent to me this is rather baffling one can buy the part on the web i was also informed that the unit was out of its one year warranty it did not seem to matter to them that my problems with the unit and my contacts with them had begun while the unit was only a few months old only when i assured them that i was holding in my hand a printed warranty did they continue to work with me of course the company is fully aware of their flawed product and of course they are fully aware that the product has been sold with a warranty it seems that they try to bluff people who call for warranty service hoping that they might not have a copy of thier warranty the result of this third call about warranty service was that the company agreed to replace my ice cream maker under warranty but i was required to pay for shipping of my old unit back to them via ups an expense of 20 and for shipping of the replacement unit to me an expense of 10 so the cost of my ice cream maker is up to 160 luckily they do n't have any of the models available to send out as a replacement and so they are going to ship me an electric model instead i 'm hoping the electric one will be a better design it does not have the gear mechanism that the model has but i certainly would not have paid 160 for an electric ice cream maker my recommendation would be to buy a much cheaper electric ice cream maker of a more modern design from another company
i purchased this system along with 1 laser module for a small aquairum i set it up quickly and the effect was very nice however soon after setting it up i had one module die after returning it i had another one die and bought a new one only to have it and the exchanged one die i then contacted the company who was nice enough to send me 2 replacement modules free of charge but after a few weeks both of thoes died this whole time i had one blue module which had been working since the day i installed the system i pretty much gave up at this point and just left the one module in place which eventually died after a couple more months i put quite a bit of money into the system and at this point have the power adaptor and a large collection of dead modules
this tool works well but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher when first obtained could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon now that i have had it a while it can be removed but it still troubles me that the handle which does get exposed to food when using ca n't be sanitized in the dishwasher there are other silicone that have handles and i 'd recommend those instead
we were able to use our waffle maker twice and it produced some of the most amazing waffles ever on our third time using this product the waffle maker simply would not heat up at all there is another review with this same problem and amazon sent them a replacement waffle maker i am in the process of requestion that amazon do the same for me will report back on the results of this request
i bought a set of king burgundy fitted and flat sheets it looks nice and feels soft and thin but the very first day i noticed some kind of very fine burgundy color dust coming off the sheets it gets stuck to sleepwear white air return vents in my bedroom became almost red in color with this dust the worst part is that the dust stays on the bed and is very hard to remove it even with a vaccum cleaner i was careful to wash these sheets separately i collected about two full cups of red dust from dryer vent
so far i have tried two of these units the first one did not cool at all and the second one stablizes at a temperature about off from the selected temperature that is not acceptable for the wine temperature control that i had hoped to have with this device
like everything in the world this coffee maker is lawyer approved in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave
i am a huge krups fan so i thought i would outfit my new kitchen with a sleek new model as pro aroma was no longer available this coffee maker is awful the stench of plastic that it emits during brewing and when you pour the coffee is disgusting at least half of enjoying coffee is that wonderful smell right not with this one krups has been extremely unhelpful and will not acknowledge the issue their advice is to descale '' the maker because of course mineral buildup always smells like melted molded plastic good tip boys save your money this is not krups best work
i bought this in black at williams sonoma for over 100 thought i 'd spend the extra thinking i was getting a quality item that would last boy was i wrong wrong wrong ! my cheap coffee lasted longer than this thing ! day 1 the plastic smelled sooo bad that it turned the taste of my coffee into a cupful of plastic chemical waste after running vinegar through at last 4 throughout it did nothing but leak flooding my kitchen counter every time i wanted a cup of coffee less then six months later the leaking got so bad that it was ready for the garbage can one last attempt before deep sixin ' it figured that maybe the seal on the water measure just need a jiggle hardly any pressure the thing jiggled right off the coffee maker into my hand the plastic was so brittle coffee also does n't get all that hot cools very quickly even in the 'thermal carafe ' which is perfect if you like lukewarm coffee that turns ice cold after adding cream 2 stars for looks alone may be better buying a couple of disposable 40 coffee makers replacing them every 6 mo
this is a good if somewhat pricey regular pillow expect nothing else and you 'll likely be fairly happy the 'temperature regulation ' claims are just that claims any temp regulation experienced is placebo factor my rating is based upon the mfgr claims
toaster was unsafe and defective timer became weak after only a handfull of uses would not go down to 0 time and shut off almost burned house down ! overall consrtuction flimsy
i thought this toaster was great when i forst got it it looked sharp and made great toast but after two months the chrome on the first unit started to pit and blemish amoazon immediately took it back and sent out a new one when the new one was recieved the lever on it was defective and it would not lift the toast out when pressed amazon was great as usual but with a toaster with a price tag like this one should expect better
i wanted to love this toaster i really did i read all the reviews and was convinced that this would be a great working long lasting toaster i bit the bullet spent way more money than i wanted to and ordered this toaster i like the way it looks and i like that it does n't ' you can check the toast anytime that you want and return it to toasting with the cool lever however i wish i returned it it is slow it is a pain to plug in before each use must be unplugged when not being used and worse of all it does not toast evenly ! top is burnt bottom is not even toasted at all or one slice is done perfect and the other slice is like it was never put into the toaster this toaster would be a waste of money at 9.99 it should be illegal to charge 200 for it that said amazon 's price of 200. was a better deal than william sanoma 's at 299. but i am still sooooo disappointed in this purchase upon the other reviews i find that the people that purchased 'refurbished ' models seem more pleased with their purchase leads me to wonder if upon 'refurbishing ' they are making them better somehow
i recieved the product as ordered but found it to be larger tnan picture and too bulky for my use on two different occasions in the past month i have requested procedures to return the product and both times i have been told that a label with instructions would be sent for returning the product and a credit would be granted i still have not recieved either label or a credit for the product i have no use for the combination opener and since i requested a credit and procedure for return within the required time limit i expected to have it and do not after over three weeks of trying to get cooperation i will not be using this site for further purchases
the quality of construction is very poor the sprayer only streamed the oil no matter how long i pumped the rim around the bottom began to leak every time i pumped i had to throw this sprayer away after using it for just a few months i recommend you purchase chef mate 's oil sprayer the container is glass actually mists the oil and it only costs 6.95
i ordered this product a month ago and have yet to receive it what 's the problem
the idea is great and when this attractive mister worked it was excellent however it frequently emitted the olive oil we never used it for anything else in a thin stream instead of a mist when that happened i tried to clean the spray valve to no avail then suddently it would mist again the pump mechanism manual is somewhat difficult to create adequate pressure and we suspect persons with arthritic hands would not be able to use it after somewhat satisfactory use for about five years it failed completely so maybe we did get our money 's worth all things considered am now looking for a better model as a replacement
this is the most useless tool ever ! i got this last christmas and it was in the garbage by valentines day it leaks and gets rusty it get clogged very easy and does not spray like it is meant to do n't waste your monsy on this piece of trash
this devise leaks and works marginally for spraying oil but it does raise frustration levels i followed directions very carefully and after finding puddles of oil on the counter from this contraption i relagated it to the garage
were not in stock order cancelled no other info has been received regarding item
i agree that this coffee maker brews coffee too fast for 6 cups of coffee i need to use 6 heaping tbsp of coffee where in my previous coffee maker i could get by with 3 or so my wife also noticed that the coffee was very weak the first time she used this coffee maker so maybe we 'll use it just when we have company but for now i guess i 'll keep using the free that i got with gevalia coffee several yrs ago
i have disappointed with the performance of this toaster after weeks of research i purchased this to replace my 8 year old cuisinart which had been discontinued six months later i have yet to get an evenly toasted piece of bread and have to continually adjust the settings unfortunately since i purchased it through amazon 's merchant online i ca n't return it wish i 'd gone with the braun
the photo shows a whole box of jars but they 're only selling one do n't be fooled by these jokers
i am way disappointed in these sheets i just got them and read the instructions on how to wash them and i did so i put them on my bed and they feel like paper i thought they were supposed to be soft they are 800 thread count but i am new at this maybe if i keep washing them they will get bette
the 800 count weave is wonderful but we washed it exactly as advised in the instructions and the thing shrank ! ! ! it fits 3 corners of the bed but even i a former weight lifter weighing 270 pounds could not pull it down over the corner more than one pad 's width so the corner '' sits on the top of the bed some 6 inches into the sleeping area i would not buy this item again nor would i ever recommend it perhaps the shrinkage is the reason the sheets are discounted so much
i recieved one of these for christmas i would love to tell you how it works it is missing a plastic piece now to be fair i lost it in the confusion of christmas it must have gotten tossed i called rival to purchase a replacement piece what a joke i emailed response i called they do n't know what i am talking about even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual or if i get a rep who does know what the piece is they say they do n't have one to sell but if i want to pay to ship the unit back and forth they will replace it i have left voice mail messages for supervisors so instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece i will return this to the store as defective and get the money back they lose a sale the store loses a sale they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit do not buy rival products we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor illogical treatment
i 've used this broken '' steamer which i 'd brought from bed bath and beyond about 1 year ago the water tank 's cover came loose and the water will once in a while flow out of the water tank how awesome ! i 'm getting some other brand now
i thought this item would be terrific as a quick way to get the wrinkles out of my husbands work shirts about the only thing it steamed up was my ceiling it 's difficult to control and does n't have a good mechanism to hold the shirt firmly to get those wrinkles out if you 're looking for a finished '' pressed look you wo n't find it with this device it 's a short cut that produces mediocre results at best
i loved this for the 3 months i used it before the head fell apart despite hot water leaking onto my hand it removed wrinkles from dress shrit and slacks very well now it 's useless and no replacement head is available i would put the effort into repair but it appears from reviews that more trouble is inevitable if you have n't experienced problems with this machine either you have n't had it long enough or do n't use it
my cuisinart grind brew recently died so i 've been shopping for a new coffee pot digression cuisinart has the worst customer service i 've ever experienced in my life i 've read on virtually every customer review website out there that the coffee for the java studio is only luke warm but since i 'm a big fan of kitchenaid 's appliances i figured i 'd still give it a chance especially since i do n't like my coffee super hot i picked up the java studio nearly a week ago and it went back to the store yesterday the coffee was barely luke warm and 'preheating ' the thermal carafe hardly made a difference at all if the coffee is n't hot enough for someone who does n't care for piping hot coffee i can only imagine the frustration of those who do crave it piping hot on the note of needing to 'preheat ' a thermal carafe this is simply rediculous for all of cuisinart 's faults in the years i had my thermal grind brew the coffee was always piping hot and kept it 's heat for hours never needing to be 'preheated ' needing to preheat a carafe renders an automatic coffeemaker useless bottom line kitchenaid needs to rectify this situation asap if they want to continue to keep their loyal customers i swear by kitchenaid the quality is amazing and the customer service is great with that said i 'm now the owner of a bunn thermalbrew which is wonderful
i purchased two digital steel coffee maker as christmas gifts one for myself and the other for my sister both of these units turned out to be major duds and will be returned quicker than santa can navigate his way back to the north pole problem the coffee comes out warm and the carafe does not retain warmth for more than 10 minutes and that 's stretching it ! the heating plate is only warm to the touch immediately after brewing you have to microwave the coffee almost immediately after it is brewed comment the reviewer who wrote that having to the carafe with piping hot water before brewing a pot of coffee had it right ! that should have been a clue i had the same gut feeling '' when i read the instructions in my view a consumer should n't have to waste hot water to '' a unit with a stiff sticker price ! as for the reviewer who implied that those of us who are dissappointed with this unit need to read the instuctions gim me a break
i read other reviews saying that the coffee was not hot enough but i assummed that those posters were picky and needed a very hot cup of coffee i was wrong i made three pots and right after brewing i could put my finger in the coffee cup with out any discomfort once milk was added i had to microwave the coffee because it was lukewarm at best i have a very sensitive tongue and can not drink coffeeshop coffee even after adding milk for atleast 5 minutes i tried warming the carafe like the instructions advised and still the coffee was only warm perhaps there are alot of defective machines ca n't imagine this is how it is intended to function out there but i was n't going to waste more time and just returned it the fact that it even suggested to warm the carafe to maximize heat should have been a bad sign for any price this machine was a dud if you want to take a gamble and buy this machine make sure to buy from a place like bed bath and beyond which will easily accept returns
i 've had an old coffee maker for a long time that makes good coffee but i thought i was ready for something even better i am disappointed with this one i thought i could n't go wrong with a kitchenaid product but sure enough i did the design is attractive and i like that you do n't have to purchase paper filters however i have two problems with it 1 the coffee is n't hot enough i like a very hot cup of coffee because i put milk in it which cools it down a little my old coffee maker made very hot coffee so it did n't matter how much milk i put in it was still hot not so with this one the coffee was luke warm after i put my usual amount of milk in this is my main complaint and i 'll probably have to return it for this reason 2 next problem is that i set the automatic timer so i could wake up to a fresh brewed cup of coffee i set it according to the manual instructions and i think i did it correctly when i woke up this morning no coffee ! ! what a disappointment i think i 'll go back to using my free coffee maker from gevalia that has reliably made good coffee for me for the past three years !
wanted to try it did coffee is too expensive n't use ordinary coffee to be very very fine grind oh well the local thrift store will find a new owner
seriously disappointed it simply does n't work well i am giving it a 1 because i will use it for warming foods the purchase price was n't totally lost if one puts on the cover the bacon is steamed if one takes off the cover the bacon requires paper towels to hold down splatters i did n't have to buy this product to use paper towels they already worked on my own plates
my husband was disappointed in this product what he was used to was being able to grill his hamburgers in the microwave i was unable to find the grill we had before maybe it is not made anymore this one did to him exactly what the george foreman grill does which we have and that was not the texture he was looking for
i just had to write something because i ca n't believe the amount that this tea kettle is listed for on here 90.00 ! come on ! the exact tea kettle is available directly from kitchen aid for almost half that price ! specifically referring to the kitchenaid cook for the cure limited edition stainless steel tea kettle with pink silicone ''
the plastic threads were stripped after taking the unit off the faucet once ! a very frustrating product ! do not buy
after 9 months of reasonably good service the entire faucet apparatus started leaking and becamse unusable the leaking water came out of the plastic seams on the sides of the device to it definitely appears to be faulty construction the most annoying thing is that i just bought some 3 replacement cartridges for the unit which is now useless what a waste of money i 'm looking for a better alternative
this product seems to only design to last max 1 year as it will start to leak like crazy luckily in australia they offer 2 year warranty so i got it replaced but i will not go back to this system turn to the jug one instead
i am a doctor in a large metro area i bought brita filters some months ago thinking that the tap water needed to be filtered this filter started growing mold and what else inside the housing i had been having diarrhea and upset stomach for the last few weeks before i took this thing off the tap i had no idea what was going on until i took it apart there was red mold and black mold all over the water flow area inside and outside the housing i could n't believe it ! ! this filter is made for the third world where there are larvae and eggs in the water there is chemical and bacterial contamination in the us this thing does nothing for that it is a lawsuit waiting to happen i wrote to brita and have heard little else but do not buy this product or anything like it drink distilled water like i do now or just drink tap water
believe it or not there was red stuff inside ! ! ! ! ! today i unscrew my brita ultra faucet filter system '' well i was shocked to discover that inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing i called brita and was told that it is not the product since it is not even designed to filter out bacteria it must be the water long story short brita still pushes it product on people who does n't know better this product is poorly designed and drains bad therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one if you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out neither did i you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality
the packing was not good the box arrived broken
while i still love the pattern and the color was just what i 'd hoped i received two sets of these dishes and both had air bubbles in the glaze on the plates showing bare stone in tiny circles all over the eating surface while amazon was good to exchange and then return them and provide a refund i am unfortunately out a large promotional gift certificate and very disappointed with my experience with these plates
i registered for these because henckels has a good reputation but i am really disappointed the knives are not recommended for the dishwasher and i have hand washed them all despite this after one time of using the chopping knife and hand washing it it has begun to rust i wish i would have registered for the more expensive knives in the long run it would have saved me money
we received 2 sets of these glasses for a wedding gift exactly 2 years ago we love the look of them however we only have 3 tall glasses left out of 16 in only 2 yrs ! ! they crack in the same place when getting ice out of our refrigerator 's ice machine ! ! the crack occurs in the widest and weakest area of the glass this has happened with 2 different refrigerators we 've had we 've also had 2 of the glasses crack in the same place in our dishwasher and they were n't crowded together at the time we wo n't be buying these glasses again despite their great appearance we will be sending a complaint letter to the company as well br
after one washing of the pearl grey towels they are ruined they look as if they were washed with bleach terrible streaks running through them now they can not be used if guests are coming over its true you get what you pay for i will replace these with a better product i gave this product one star because that was the least allowed but it should get zero stars
i received this coffeemaker for christmas after two months of use it quit working i contacted hamilton beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker it still did not work so i contacted hamilton beach again now i have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with 6 to get a new cord since it was n't my fault why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored stay away from hamilton beach products
i 've had two hamilton beach products the first was brew master which we wanted because the coffee is dispensed through a coffee carafe at the top of the machine however the carafe is plastic with seams and after 4 months began to leak all over the counter hamilton beach replaced the carafe but the new one leaked again after 4 months we then demanded a stay or go thermal coffeemaker i had it for two or three weeks and then as i was washing it out with hot water and a bottle sponge the glass vacuum liner blew up with a bang ! glass shards scattered all over the sink and kitchen floor i was lucky not to have gotten shards in my eyes please look out for this one ! i 'm only buying stainless steel carafes from now on
all the littermaid products i have owned are cheaply made break easily this is no exception i decided to give them another the item looked improved from the original big square version of their litter cover the plastic is cheap and breaks easily the material is flimsy my cat peed on it and i washed it but did n't dry it shrunk ! ! ! and would n't fit in the frame i had to throw the whole thing out after much much frustration trying to get the thing back together definitely do n't waste your money on any littermaid products
this item is good for a party setting not for small gatherings the quantities you must mix are large 1 gallon at a time because otherwise the machine does not work properly if you wait to serve the second batch it is watered down because of the amount of ice that you have to put in to make the machine work the margarator works much slower than the directions state after 3 unsuccessful attempts to make the perfect batch of margaritas i returned the machine
the margarator will process your ingredients to small pebbles of ice and a liquid and then all liquid all you will need is ice for a margarita on the rocks i am taking the machine back and hoping for better results from a quality blender
i was excited when i saw the product in a store and read the box however after receiving one as a gift i regretted adding it to my amazon wish list in the first place oh the things i could have had with that 90 blown on the margarator first of all it did not come with a product manual and the company ignored my request for assistance so i played frankenstein 's lab with some mix and tequila what did i get not slushy pretty margaratas as shown on the box nope that was margaritas on the rocks which can be accomplished without a 95 piece of junk machine like the margarator save your money folks and do n't even give this thing to people who think they want one as a gift
i had 2 pieces of this item both had similar problems first and major one is water and steam leakage between the filter holder and the machine this i believe is due to poor chinese assemblage secondly perfect froth '' nipple has terrible persistent ordor of the material its made of which perfectly transmits to your drink krups should 've thought of changing this design and set better quality control over assemblage the item was returned
we have been enjoying a cup of capuccino every single morning for at least 9 years our old model broke and needed to be replaced we chose the krups xp 4000 based on it 's 15 bar pump setting and because our previous very old machines were from krups and we were happy with them what a dissapointment ! yes it works but the pump is very loud the biggest problem is that the brew head seal needs to be replaced frequently part 620342 we got our machine in may 2006 and make 2 cups each morning we are at our ! seal that 's a seal replacement roughly every couple months one needs a very short srewdriver to do this i would never buy this machine again wish i never had and regret i did n't return it when i still could
i have had the for 2 months it makes good however the frothing devise works poorly and is unreliable i sent the machine out for repairs the service center took two weeks to replace a gasket and retrun freight prepaid the frothing devise still works poorly i am disappointed and believe i wasted my time effort and money do not recommend ps i see krups has discontinued the know why
i have owned 6 espresso machines that i can recall in my life 1 gaggia a heavy italian machine which i should have taken much better care of which means wiping off the steam nozzle when steaming milk along with running the steamer while wiping and decalcifing with vinegar which is smelly but unclogs mineral sediments which precipitate in the workings of the machine these steps must be performed on all espresso machines period case closed the gaggia i believe i gave away or threw away 1 proteo grande another heavy italian machine which i neglected to decalcify but simply stored away 10 years ago i have also owned 4 krups machines 2 of these krups were the very inexpensive variety that lacked a pump both of which failed because the pressure vessel for steam began to leak and overheat 1 krups machine a pump machine model 968 worked very very well from december 1999 thru february 2006. model 968 made exceptional espresso you got a very nice crema layer at the end of the draw simply because a little handle in front which selected whether or not you wanted steam or flowing water snapped off i was forced to use a kitchen knife in the groove left by the snapped off selector button and because this caused the mechanism itself to prematurely wear made the unit unusable unusable is what krups xp 4000 is for some reasons not previously stated 1. attention users take the plastic water storage unit out and check the bottom of the unit most likely you will see to inch or more of water that has leaked from the water intake valve now with the machine off ! cool ! and all water trays and top and bottom grills removed simply turn the unit over 90 degrees and dump the water out replace the plastic water storage unit and everything else then use 'normally ' if you can for a few days or a week then take the water storage out again and check for water seepage and leakage into the main plastic housing you should find the same leakage problem this is an unacceptable design defect which prevents water from cooling the boiler and servicing the steamer 2. as with all the other reviews the steamer simply leaks a dribble of hot water not enough to melt ice if you left a pitcher of cold milk under the steamer and returned 15 minutes later you 'd have watery lukewarm milk ! 3. other reviews stated that the froth steamer attachment constitutes a hazard as it flys off unexpectantly krups model 968 had a similar attachment which i removed and threw away with model 968 the steamer worked very very well without the froth attachment for 6 years occasionally it would clog up and i 'd take the end of a safety pin to unclog it or i would simply unscrew the plastic housing it would remove nicely and i 'd place the steamer nipple in some hot water and vinegar overnite and the steamer would perform pretty nicely note this is model 968 not xp 4000. do not try to unscrew the black steam nipple from xp 4000 see note below ! ! ! you may use without the froth attachment and it will steam milk okay but it must be fussed with poking the hole in the black steam nipple over and over again but frequently however steam pressure goes down so low you have to put the selector knob to the 90 degree position allow water to fill in the machine again click over to 'heat up ' then when the lite goes off you may continue steaming krups is a perfect excuse for being late to work or anywhere else if you can not leave the house without your latte and i will not leave the house to go to starbucks for any reason whatsoever unless my machine fails which it did ! note xp 4000 can not have it 's rubber nipple unscrewed you are forced to stick a safety pin or other sharp object in it to unclog the milk steamer the hole in the nipple itself is much too small it is small to overcompensate for the lack of pressure from the pump kind of a wishful design integration technique which fails oh so miserably ! xp 4000 started leaking massive amounts of water after less than 45 days of use i sent it to a local krups repair facility and i imagine i 'll either get another or they might have the common sense to discontinue the as a bad design mistake from beginning to end if anyone up there likes me and krups might upgrade me to the more expensive so now you have it so there i was espressofiend with no java and i 'd rather pull out my fingernails than go into starbucks for latte only i can make the perfect latte which explains why i am single ! so i took out my 10 year old proteo grande from under my sink where it had been stored for 10 years and said a prayer while cleaning the cobwebs off and decalsifying and would n't you know it it works ! just fine ! but then again that is what i 'd expect from a heavy italian machine moral if you want to say to starbucks forever and brew the perfect latte over and over again spend at least 200 on a quality italian machine krups does make nice coffeemakers every once in a while whew ! i hope this helps somebody !
when i got this table i was shocked to see that the table measured 24 inches wide by 24 inches deep the product description says that it is only 14 inches deep that was the size i wanted not a square ! ! ! too bad they did not put a more accurate size in the description now i 'm stuck with a table that is too wide ! ! ! buy beware ! !
the ice trays have no guiders on the bottom to catch onton the ridges in the freezer the slide from side to side and overflow at times the cubes are way to small they melt too quickly
i have never felt heard sheets that were so scratchy and loud i returned both sets that i purchased even after washing with warm water with softner nothing worked and again the sound of these sheets would wake you up as you turned on them
the quality was disappointing and does not compare with my old 100 cotton percale sheets which were made in the usa unfortunately the american factories are now closed the sheets are very thin and do not have the softness or body of 100 cotton i ordered white sheets and the set that arrived was cream colored and yellowed a bleach wash removed some of the yellow i would not buy this product again nor do i recommend it i think amazon should state that the sheets are made in china i need 100 cotton because i have an allergy problem with synthetics such as polyester i hope these sheets are all cotton but the thinness is reminescent of polyester hope i am wrong
purchased this sheet set as the description stated that it would fit deep mattress as with every other sheet set i have purchased for the deep mattress the fitted sheet does fit however if one wants to tuck in the flat sheet on one side of the mattress there is hardly any sheet left to cover the bed ! i guess that deep mattress sheet sets will always be '' on the flat sheet until manufacturers begin making an oversize flat sheet too i am none the less disappointed
you can not hear the timer it is poorly made and was an absolute waste of money i love kitchen aid mixers and my kitchen aid dishwasher is the best ever but trust me this timer is awful
i thought i was the only one who had problems with it ! ! i also thought that maybe i had received a defective one but after reading the other reviews i 'm glad i 'm not crazy ! ! just like the others i had to have it to match my other pink kitchenaid and le creuset kitchen equipment i also replaced the battery if you almost smash the buttons to pieces it is possible to set it however if it does n't go completely blank on you before your food is done you might have a decent meal
this kitchen timer is really cute and i had to have it to match every other pink kitchenaid appliance that i own and love but you simply can not hear it when the other review said that you could n't hear it from the other room they were being generous you literally ca n't hear it from like 3 feet away unless you really concentrate so buy it if you just think it 's cute it is but still you will have to buy a timer for your kitchen or you 're gon na burn the cookies
i bought this coffee machine in october 2006 from amazon after reading the reviews on this page and i knew that some users had problems with the coffee leaking over the sides and onto the hot plate but i figured that it was only happening to some of the customers and some of the time this coffee maker makes great coffee and it looks good on our counter but this coffee machine needs constant supervision because at least in our case it will over the sides and onto the hotplate and frequently in enough volume to also go over the edge of the plate and all over the counter if we set it up to make a 6 cup pot and go off to have a shower we frequently come back to a mess on the counter top because at least a cup of coffee has not made it into the carafe and as someone noted it 's impossible to figure out how to resolve the problem we have looked at the drip stop '' mechanism in the basket and there 's nothing obvious here we 've looked at the top of the carafe and there 's nothing there either you can seat and the carafe and sometimes it will work and and other times a disaster today we are simply staying in the kitchen to watch the entire pot brew as the leaking can occur at anytime in the brewing cycle not just at the start i am now so annoyed that i am writing the company to tell them how annoying this is and i buying a new coffee maker i am not sure amazon will allow me to return the machince but i will try buy something else unless you really like troubleshooting a design that needed a bit more beta testing before it was ready for production
i 'm no coffee snob but the idea of innovative design in the pursuit of better coffee appealed to me this coffee maker does make good coffee but really not noticeably better than our previous krups and cuisinart units the reason i am starting to hate the presto is that while brewing coffee will spill over the top of the carafe onto to the hot plate and counter if the carafe is not positioned just so and it is very difficult to determine what the just so '' position is so often its a big mess and a pain
quality is fine but the size is too small to be usefull
i purchased this item as a filler i have two steamers already that are yrs old first of all i found this item to be smaller than i expected secondly i washed this item as instructed and left it out to air dry as i do with my others without any problems on the second day i noticed some dark blemishes on the underside these eventually turned into numberous dark spots on the underside on both basket parts of the steamer i have never experienced this before ! they were deep into the bamboo this item had just been steamed then washed in very hot water and allowed to air dry i have no idea how this happened i used one of my others at the same time and it never developed this problem i returned the item to amazon
this rice cooker is the worst buy i have ever made my wife bought on and it worked great for three days then it just stopped working one day i returned it and got a new one thinking that it was just the one we bought brought it home and again it worked great for thre days and then it just stopped this is truly the worst buy ever
i agree with jane who says that the glass bowl is very thin and can break very easily ours broke with very little pressure during cleaning we went to a thrift store and bought a larger bowl made of heavy glass for just 50 cents our betta is now swimming around more and the bowl is nearly
bettas need a tank with a heater as they are a tropical fish that means at least a 5 gallon tank as it is difficult to heat smaller tanks safely they can survive in smaller containers like this but will not thrive i noticed a big difference in my betta when i moved him from a 1 gallon which is larger than this betta bowl to a heated 5 gallon he is more active and his colour is brighter also bettas are known to jump out of their tanks which is why every reputable source of information on bettas recommends that their tanks have covers this small betta sphere has no cover
i was very happy to see the look compact microwave from sharp but it did n't work for me as soon i started i have found that there is no back light display for which is quite common for any mocrowave and also it does n't have good for the tray as it makes some rattling noise when we try to use bigger boxes to heat not worth for 70 i have seen my friends using 30 microwave with better results
the sharp microwave was reasonably priced and arrived just as promised the packaging was extremely poor and i was elated to discover the microwave was not destroyed during transit because the box it was shipped in was
it brews good coffee looks great problem is it leaks a lot onto the burner and below the unit we have sent it back and had 2 replacements all three started leaking within a few weeks i am now looking for another make or model of coffee maker as it appears they have not been able to resolve the leakage problem with this machine
be advised that the clock is prone to mechanical failure ! ! ! i have returned a sister '' version of this coffee pot three times the first time was just a broken carafe but the and times were mechanical failures after the return i repurchased the same pot within one month the entire clock faded to black and would not work which meant no timer functioning i thought that this was a fluke so i returned the pot again ! and got another one after 3 months the clock still worked but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just stopped working out of the blue ! so it too was returned i do n't think i 'll be buying any coffee products again be advised that the clock is prone to mechanical failure ! ! ! the way i have had the same problems as everyone else overflowing at filter dripping onto the burner etc but i could deal with them as long as my morning coffee was actually made in the morning
i have not had any of the spillage or steam problems that a lot of people seem to have my problem with the coffee maker is that it just does n't always make a good cup of coffee first of all when i got the coffee maker i was surprised to find that to make the same strength of coffee i was use to i had to use double the amount of coffee grounds than i did usually so i go through coffee a lot more quickly than i did before i always make coffee the same way using the same amount of water and the same amount of grounds at times the coffee is fine but at times it is extremely weak so weak i have to spend extra time to make more coffee a crucial part of my morning ! the strength '' selector is completely worthless i do n't notice any difference in my coffee whatsoever furthermore the digital analog clock face while it may be aesthetically pleasing to some focus group is really annoying when you are trying to set the timer you have a digital clock put digital numbers on it please finally the coffee temperature '' knob is useless unless you plan on drinking coffee at least 15 minutes after you make it if you drink the coffee right when it comes off the pot its barely warm
color me dense but after going through 8 coffee coffeemakers in the past 10 years i 'm tossin ' in the towel ! the longest period of time that one has lasted was about 18 months i just think that a person should be able to get more than 12 to 18 months of use out of a 40 to 50 coffeemaker that is used to make only one pot of coffee per day the problem with 5 of these 8 coffeemakers was the heating plate going out ie just ceasing to heat at all the problem with the other 3 was leakage massive leakage as in an instantaneous rupture in the water tank and the entire content emptying within a few seconds ! so after having cleaned up my most recent coffee spill just a few minutes ago i have finally duh decided it is time to give up on coffee coffeemakers and never allow one of the foul quality beasts to darken my countertop again ! my advise is if anyone wants to buy a new 40 to 50 coffeemaker every year or so buy a coffee otherwise steer clear of this poor quality product and shop for another brand as to which brand of coffeemaker i have yet to discover that answer as i type this but as i am searching i can promise one thing it definitely will not be a coffee product ! this is the first i have ever written about a product on amazon but i was so peeved about this last mess i had to clean up that i felt the need to vent a bit
purchased one of these for my wife so she could enjoy having two betas divider is included in this package at less than one year we started noticing some leakage from this aquarium it first started at the base then there were small cracks appearing on the side and front the aquarium was never hit or knocked around i can only say stay away from this aquarium '' i 've got an eclipse system 3 on order which should be a much better replacement as i have one of the 12 gallon versions which are outstanding in regards to filtration
be forewarned there is a curing '' process that must be performed in a well ventilated area outside your home i was aware of this requirement and performed the procedure on my patio the instructions warn that the roaster will smoke during this procedure and it certainly does the next day i used the roaster inside the house and that was a mistake it only gave off a small amount of smoke but the smell was overpowering if you want your house to smell like burning electrical insulation your throat to burn and your mouth to taste like you are sucking on a copper penny then follow the manufacturer 's directions if you really want a nesco roaster i would suggest that you repeat the curing '' process at least two or three times before using it inside your home i 'm not sure this will work it is only a guess as i was so angry that i threw mine in the trash my recommendation would be to buy a roaster that does n't require a curing '' procedure before use if such a procedure is necessary then the manufacturer should perform it
even though the pan is and using baking spray cornbread frequently sticks resulting in a shaped lump of food then it is difficult to clean the small crevices not recommended
i have not received this item yet so i ca n't really review it thank
this is without a doubt the worst appliance i have ever purchased i purchase a lot ! i have had 4 units in two years because no one repair them i have lost so much time contacting haier getting the waiting for replacements paying to get them installed etc i am replacing with another brand i will never buy a haier anything ever again
i bought two of these machines for my mother and aunt in may 2003. one never worked and the other broke down after two weeks of use br i have spent hours on the phone with the haier company and with so called repair companies trying to get this thing fixed and so far we have two pieces of junk and nothing else except we are out about 2 grand br repair companies wo n't drive to my house or they send someone who can not fix the machine because they are not familiar with it i have spoken to the head of repair at haier in nyc perhaps 10 different times i have gotten lots of promises but nothing more br i am preparing to go through maryland consumer services and perhaps hire a lawyer to get our money back this is after one and a half years of br br this company is nothing but trouble
we purchased the combo a year ago we did it in spite of the mixed reviews on and the negative advice of the sales person he warned that the product has very bad reputation that he would not accept returned we decided to buy it regardless based on the stories from our relatives in china that haier is very good brand name in china the company offers excellent services in china they tried to the extreme to make their chinese customers happy less than a month after the purchase the combo broke down it was a fuse problem and common one with the machine the repair personal came to fix it the machine stopped working roughly a month later that the dryer stops working the repair personal had to order parts to fix it he did fix it again after about a month the machine 's dryer stopped working this time the repair personal declared that the machine is beyond repair he promised to report to haier america and request a replacement on our behalf however we could not reach the repair personal again ever since that we started long saga of talking haier 's service center in america they always appeared to be nice and promise to look into what happen to our complains but they never fulfil their promise when the warranty is about to expire we tried to contact haier china they promised again but to no results finally our relatives in china had to call haier china this time a reliable manager took action his staff called us and arrange the replacement we just got the replacement machine but we 're still worrying when it will break again it seems haier may be really trying but their business model an d volumn in us may not be able sustain the level of quality that they are used to provide in china it 's a challenge to haier usa to achieve the scale of ecconomy or invest to provide good services to attract enough customers haier should really appreciate those early adopters and treat them well for their own sake
for a machine that needs to be serviced regularly they need to check their customer service department i 've had the machine for a year had to have it replaced becuase it just did n't work when we got it then 9 months later the dryer broke a month after they fixed that it broke again ! i 've had it with haier and plan on telling their management what a horrible product and service they provide
i have had this unit for almost a year the dryer first started to leak water during the dry cycle and eventually stopped working all together the repair company told me flat out they could not fix it and would have to call the manufacture this was after ordering parts on two different occasions and them coming out about 8 different times i have yet to hear back from the company haier america refuses to call me back about replacing the unit or repairing it i would not recommend buying this unit to anyone
i bought this cocktail shaker as a gift the package came on time but when i opened the package i noticed that the container that had the shaker inside was opened the next moment i realized that the cover top and the strainer of the shaker were missing so i only got the bottom of the shaker in my package it is very frustrating i rated it as 1 star so that i can post the review obviously i did not have a chance to use it
i bought cerama bryte and their stainless steel cleaner with all the gadgets and bought in bulk 6 bottles of each i paid for the whole shipment over 97 with shipping the cerama bryte does not work at all on taking the spots or the overflow of the water when your boiling potatoes and it boils on to the cooktop this was a real waste of good money the stainless steel cleaner is just i was willing to spend the money for a real good cleaner to keep my very expensive new italian made stainless steel range with the sealed ceramic cooktop that cost me over 2250 us after i found that the cerama bryte did not give me good results i started searching the internet for other ways to clean the ceramic stovetop without scratching or damaging it here is my recommendation by a can of bar keepers friend cleaning powder for about 1.19 a can and the clean magic erasers wet your ceramic cooktop with a little water and put a couple of teaspoons of the bar keepers friend powder put a little bit of water on your clean magic eraser and then lightly rub all the powder and water with the eraser after a couple of minutes wipe off the paste with a sponge and get it so it is nearly clean finish off with windex and a paper towel and you have a beautiful clean ceramic cooktop just like it was new so i have my cleaning cabinet full of this cerama bryte cleaner treated wipes stainless steel cleaner and treated wipes as well and i am going to give it to anyone who wants to pick it up if not gone in the next month it is all going out with the trash for pickup worst cleaning product i have ever used is cerama bryte
i bought this feeder to take care of my cats while i was away on weekends at first everything was great so i kept it running every day after 2 months of daily use the feeder stopped working i exchanged it for another feeder of the same model which the broke after another 7 months maybe it will work better if it is limited to short periods of operation but do not get this feeder if you plan to use it every day
this feeder only worked 1 out of 3 times and left our cat hungry for 2 whole weekends while we were away after the first use the feeding mechanism broke the timer no longer worked and the time of day reset itself the second it was set to feed i do not recommend this item
just stick down the adhesive and slide the plastic part over it ! your problems are solved ! wrong ! i followed the directions 100 and within one day water had gotten under the guard and loosened the adhesive super strong adhesive only works if water does n't get near it and this product does not prevent water from getting next the adhesive tape i had to caulk around the entire bottom of the guard to ensure it would n't come unstuck again and the product still does n't work save your money and do n't buy this !
looked for a shower guard for kids does n't fit any of our showers has a square corner all ours have curves where there is grout and corian
i suggest you find a better splash guard than this one must cost about to manufacture and works about as well slide a piece of pvc onto a runner you tape onto the tub and surround water leaks behind the tape so it is essentially useless
per the photo i was expecting hunter or forrest green the color is a pale ugly yellowish green i have n't used them so i ca n't comment on use as i plan to donate them to goodwill i doubt any of the colors except maybe black will be accurate
i looked around and read reviews and information on numerous down comforters and i thought i was getting a real bargain with the royal velvet boy was i wrong ! i have already had to replace it and i used it less than a month all the down settled down the channels to the sides so there was none covering the body at night not good ! do not buy this comforter it is crap
like other reviewers here mine also experienced problems with the controller in a little over 1 year of light use it was set to oven on for and started producing blue smoke out the top vent i took it apart to what happened the control panel was burnt ! everything was perfectly clean inside so that was n't what caused it i would not recommend buying this toaster oven or even continue using it if you ualready have one
i got a lot of use out of this toaster oven for the first 2 years it toasts fairly evenly the broiler works well and the controls are easy unfortunately a problem started about 3 weeks ago the toast setting would click off after just a few seconds making it impossible to toast anything today i turned on the oven and the wiring inside the controls started to smoke i unplugged it immediately and now have to replace the whole unit i would not recommend this oven internal wiring should not burn under normal use especially after just a few years
i bought the eco pods but i have been disappointed because the coffee just seems too weak for my liking i have tried it about 3 times i was worried i might pack it too tight or put too much coffee in it so that might be the problem i will keep trying but so far i am disappointed
i have been using the ecopads sold on amazon for a couple of months once i got the hang of it espresso grind coffee packed firmly but not overpacked i discovered that i could enjoy my favorite coffee in the senseo machine beware quickcup pods do not work right they are about of an inch smaller than the ecopads and that 's the difference the water must slip around the edge because using quickcup results in a watery brew i 'm quite skilled at loading the ecopads so i tried the quickcups 3 times to be sure i repeat they do n't work right there 's a reason the ecopads are twice as expensive they work
it just does not work with senseo machines i tried several different grinds and no matter what water just spurted out the side i was ripped off
i purchased this and the first machine was defective it was replaced i received a replacement which has also died something with the computer chip this time not mechanical it seems one month is the mark where they die out i 'm sure some people have had success and i want success with this but it just is n't happening i just hope amazon will process my refund as i am wary about getting another defective machine !
our church purchesed 2 urns they were used about 5 times and one burned out it does not heat up or perk the coffee anymore we were very disappointed as they were purchased in march of 2004
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice
actually i would not rate this item with any stars instructions were confusing and it was more trouble than it was worth an ordinary sharp knife left this item in tee dust i had to return it
i was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight it looked to be walmart type quality i would have been better off buying from linens and things
this toaster looks great but it is incredibly slow much slower than the cheapo toaster i owned before this one it takes minutes for a piece of bread to toast it does seem to toast evenly though it features a removable crumb tray but the shell '' of the toaster is one piece so there is still a solid bottom beneath the crumb tray if crumbs fall off the crumb tray they are trapped at the bottom of the toaster i have a couple of large crumbs stuck in the bottom of the toaster that i can not get out fortunately they do not burn or smoke when the toaster is in use i would rate this toaster high on looks low on performance
what is wrong with the toasters they 're manufacturing today this was the second brand of toaster i had to return also returned a black decker both would only toast one side ! seems like they 'd have it right by now i finally bought one of the refurbished cuisinarts an 80 toaster for 30 thinking i could put a spotlight on it and use it as a display piece if it did n't work but the cuisinart is a great toaster ! i guess you get what you pay for unless you buy refurb
i 'm not sure exactly what i was expecting but i know this was n't it my dog ca n't play with it because it is way too big and the throwing device does n't work any better than my own arm
while the price is right it brews a quick cup of joe and its has a little more capacity than most machines thats about where the good news ends my machine 's heating element just crapped out after 5 months of use its under warranty but i am just going out to buy a different brand i find this unit is messy the caraffe does n't pour as well as the mr coffee i had for 3 years its ok if you pour very slowly but if you are a little too fast you 'll get liquid on the counter while brewing the lid is flimsy enough that it pushes up enough to release a lot of steam which over time will ruin the finish on your cabinets i also notice that if the warmer plate is left on more than about an hour my countertop becomes extremely warm i believe the bottom of the unit lacks sufficient height for proper air circulation rather than wreck your kitchen or burn the house down another product
my parents have this coffee maker and every time i 'm at their house for a few days i have to use this very slow machine to make what amounts to a weak cup of coffee which i then have to proceed to forgive me coffee gods nuke for 10 seconds in order to get it hot enough of course if you like your coffee not much hotter than room temperature this may be the perfect coffee maker for you but keep in mind that the for this convenience is a very inefficient coffee maker that is warm water extracts far less coffee flavor than very hot water and on account of this you need to use far more beans to make a cup of coffee with this machine overall this is a poor coffee maker that is slow inefficient and makes cold coffee
i bought this product to replace one that had broken that i really liked i had to return this product three times because it does not as it says in the description come with the perfect pour carafe which is what i wanted since the standard carafe drips everywhere on the third time of returning it i asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size i then mentioned to amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description but they have not
the carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good no matter how careful or how i adjust my grip leaks from the top and down the side i have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter
after 6 months of use the led switch popped out of the coffeemaker 's base which turned the wired plug into an device i found that black decker no longer services these products and the firm that does does n't respond to
my bought this to make coffee for visitors it worked fine at first but after one or two months of use started to experience water leaks of increasing severity at first there were drips outside of the carafe then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints we put the whole machine on a metal tray to make easier finally it got so bad that fearing an encounter with boiling hot water the risk of an electrical shock we stopped using it in the end i was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket it 's a circular with a tiny hole in the middle from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug i then inserted a filter coffee and poured in hot water from a kettle while this sounds ridiculous it 's a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine my recommendation avoid this machine it 's disturbing that black and decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality
it worked well until the low setting went out i had it a little over a year
its great if you have every other calphalon line item but do n't be fooled when they mention stainless steal it does not again does not fit the stainless steal stockpot as it indicated !
i received two of these for christmas i tried them both both leaked liquid from 3 different spots when turned to pour also the plastic tops had touches of gray plastic on them i returned them both and bought 2 of the zojirushi champagne gold series tall thermal carafe herb cacao carafes instead which work great
i have a few brown spots on the bottom of my le creuset i have never been able to get them off i thought this product would be the magic formula but it was n't if you 're thinking about purchasing a le creuset you might think about purchasing the cleaner too to catch any stains as they happen but once they 're set nothing will take them out not even this cleaner
these were the only towels i wanted because i heard they were plush and the picture shows very bright '' hot '' colors and so that 's why i ordered these instead of any others because i could not find any other towels that looked so bright and i checked numerous sites but upon arrival the blue towel i ordered poolside was not the same bright color as the picture it 's a regular light blue nothing special about it i will be returning it and can get the same towels for less money at target walmart of kohl 's i think what you 're paying for is the name '' because it definently was n't as bright as they show it on the picture
the image in this product is misleading it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior
the box and inside materials say that metal utensils can be used but after a single use my metal spatula created deep grooves all over the surface the pan was ruined very disappointed
i was hoping this model would be on the recall list because it broke right away it is very noisy but the heat still works i know how silent these heaters are as i know people that have them i just purchased the new model because we really need it for our camper so far i love it it is very quiet and puts out a continuous heat instead of turning on and off i hope the company recalls the because it is too expensive for it to break so quickly
it 's a fan only ! not a heater ! ! !
provided little to no heat and i live in mississippi it would n't even take the december chill off definitly not worth the price i returned the vornado and purchased a much less expensive holmes heater which produces three times the heat
i 've had this for 18 mos something came loose in the body and it is now rather noisy also there are times when i have to turn the unit off then on to get the heating element to engage i 'm keeping this one but would n't buy it again
we bought this sweeper at christmas over a year ago it has never started and they sent another one ofter several months and it did the same then we have never even had one that wil start once and my poor mom who is 88 years old is very disappointed they are hard to get parts out of it take months to get a part i will never buy another one if you get one that works it is great but getting that one that will work is almost impossible
i had a bad impression of this item the handle broke off in my hand the machine did not charge well eventually did n't work at all the experience turned me off completely to products
i used this item about 10 times total over a four month period the battery will not work at all any longer do not buy a shark product if you intend on using it longer than a few months absolutely awful product life span
wow ! how clever of euro pro to make a disposable vacuum ! no other company has ever thought of that before ! they did forget to mention on the box that the vacuum can last up to three months this is a plus for people who do n't want to purchase a new vacuum every month this one lasts so long three whole months ! that you only have to buy four per year at 60.00 apiece that 's only 240 per year what a deal ! oh wait a minute my mistake it 's not supposed to be disposable but alas it is besides you could take that 240 and go to a vac shop and get a commercial quality vacuum for about 300 and it would last for many years not just three months after my first euro pro cordless went kaput after three months i tried in vain to get support from customer service euro pro 's customer service is worse than bad it is on a scale of 1 to 10 i would rate it a negative 10 ! thinking that perhaps i just had a lemon i foolishly bought a new shark i have a bad back and it is difficult to bend over and plug and unplug a vacuum it lasted three months as well i thought perhaps it was the belt and i finally managed to order a belt from the internet and took the shark to a vac shop to have the belt replaced the vac man said it was a piece of junk but he swapped out the belt the vacuum will now pick up some of the dog hair off the carpet though not much else but it is useless on hard surface floors due to the complete lack of anything even remotely resembling customer service at euro pro i will never buy another euro pro product as long as i live i sincerely hope that my experience will not be in vain and that it will help keep others from wasting their hard earned money on this or any other euro pro product
this thing does n't hold a charge for very long and anything with weight gets left behind they need to do more work on this idea
i hope those who just got this and think this is a great product do n't get burned like i did i thought it was great at first too but after a few weeks the battery held less and less charge and finally would n't charge at all no help from customer service do not buy this
i first purchased the blue shark cordless sweeper which did not swivel one day the cheap plastic connector where the handle bar meets the vac broke off this was less than 30 days after i purchased it and honestly i had used it about 4 or 5 times in that short period simply for the tile floor in the kitchen when i went to return it at the local store i saw the shark 3 speed version which swivels i did an exchange and shelled out another 20 bucks thinking that maybe this one would be better since the 3 speed version swivels shame on me ! it took only about 20 days to break the handle in the same spot on this one i was turning the handle to manuver around a corner and hit the corner with the edge of the shark and off broke the handel in the same spot ! i would be honest to tell you if i had really slammed the vac hard against the corner but that is not the case at all i returned it and got my money back no exchange this time
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous the handle is much too small for this size mug if you can get your finger through the small hole your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware the first and only time my family used these mugs two of us burned ourselves fiestaware really screwed up on this one a shame given the beauty of the scarlet fiestaware
this product does n't seem to carbonate to the level of regular soda water from the store i drink carbonated water all the time and what comes out of this tastes a little flat the product also seems cheaply made the first time i tried it all the blew out the spout because the handle sits at a point where the valve is slightly open i have to pull up on the handle when i insert the charger to get it to work
i really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients like cutting tomatoes however the thin material of the boards making the board rock on its center on the counter this combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping the only solution i have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it frankly that 's more trouble than it 's worth for now i am just using them for holding ingredients after i have prepped them on a better cutting board
i like the design and size but have been very disappointed that i ca n't get the smell of paint out of it fortunately i 'm not using it for bread or other food products i 'm using it as storage on my counter for vitamins and various other small items that are in jars or bottles i thought when we were finished using it for the current purpose i would use it for bread but now i question whether that will be possible
i would love to be able to give you an honest review of this bread box unfortuntly it was on back order for so long i finally had to cancel my order i was patient for over 2 months but the holidays were coming and i could not wait any longer
i still have n't received the trivet therefore ca n't use or review the casserole dis
it is easier to take things back to a local retailer if you think something is wrong with a product i believe the sharpener wheels are misaligned so the knives are being unevenly sharpened it does take off metal i 'm going to do more practicing and not on my top of the line knives
buying this delonghi deep fryer has turned out to be our worst online shopping experience we bought it in fall 2006. it broke down and started to spill oil after several usages we took it to the delonghi 's local service in chicago which looked more like a trading place for stolen goods delonghi has basically subcontracted its service in whole chicago area to a rundown and local repairing shop that was in now it is early april and not surprisingly we still wait to hear from the service our repeated calls to the local service and the delonghi did not produce any results obviously delonghi which is based in italy has a very unreliable and inefficient network in the usa if you live in the usa and has a malfunctioning delonghi product expect for the worst delonghi is not a trustworthy brand here
these are great towels if you can get them they are very soft and a great price but i ordered them in december and they came in one at a time took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock when i ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship buy these only if you have a life time to get the
i took the new oggi breadbox out of its box and began to wash it the sharp slit on the inside of the breadbox cut my finger so badly that i had to go to the er the design is seriously flawed
this product got a lot of great reviews and was the reason why i purchased it however it had very poor suction power in fact it would blow dirt away from the edges it was also very heavy to maneuver around the solution reservoir was too small and had to be refilled often cleaning the tanks takes a very long time the attachments are useless since hose is not long enough the machine needs to be repositioned frequently to be near the area you want to clean there was also leaking water on the floor every time after turning the vacuum off finally it saved me no time at all it took longer to do the floor with this vacuum than it would have if i used a broom and mop
brought this home from target today and it 's going back tomorrow the quality is unbelievably poor you actually ca n't assemble it when you screw in the dowels the screws strip the holes in the dowels so that it 's impossible to get them stable
i recived this item which was dirty not dust emailed amazon and the said that i could not get a refund as i used quit click this was the first time i had to return something and will never buy from amazon again
it was impossible to screw the table legs securely to the table top without stripping the heads on half of the 8 bolts they just would n't go in far enough nice quality wood but useless if it ca n't be assembled following their instructions
i have had serious problems with '' nuisance '' smoke alarms with this product
i have always had first alert smoke alarms and they always worked great and lasted for what seems like forever in fact i have never had a smoke alarm die until now when i moved into my aparment 10 years ago my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day it still works i only changed the alarm because of new laws a year after i started using this one it died on me i was very disappointed in the longevity of the product
garbage we have 6 smoke alarms in our house two of them are first alert this one and another model the only ones that repeatedly false alarm are the first alert this one is the worst randomly for zero reason it goes off usually in the middle of the night called customer service and they tried to tell us it was because it was near a bathroom with humidity yea right moved it downstairs near no bathrooms or kitchens and it still falses garbag
we have had a lot of trouble with '' nuisance '' smoke alarms with this product it was not anywhere near our kitchen either but in an upstairs bedroom i would recommend going with a different brand if you do not want to be repeatedly awakened at night by false alarms
this is a fine product but when it malfunctions first alert is very hard to get a hold of and requires a lot of documentation to certify that it is within warranty after 8 months my unit went out it sounds 3 quick chirps every 30 seconds for 2 weeks i have been trying to contact first alert and either get unavailability or voicemail there website does not have a form nor address to send warranty return items do n't use the corporate address unit will be returned to you even if you have a letter explaining the problem features of the unit 5 stars unit itself 3 stars customer service for the unit itself a sta
this cricket keeper is a waste of money while the black tubes with clear caps on the ends of the tubes are a good idea to help get the crickets out when you need them crickets can still escape from this keeper through the lid i set this in my bathtub since so many crickets keep escaping every night and i 'm still finding crickets around the house
this hamper is not the size stated in the description it is 18 '' wide
positive comment first it was great to buy these sets and not have to individually purchase all items it saved me a lot of time pillows pillow covers and mattress toppers are perfect ! on to the negative the sheets however are of a really poor quality they are thin and after only one wash they have already started to fray and there are even holes in the stitching of the fitted sheets they also wrinkle really badly the duvet is also thin and too small for the pinzon flannel duvet covers i bought
i bought this blanket after reading the user and editor reviews the quality of the blanket is far from what the reviewers have rated first of all the quality of the cotton used in making this blanket is very poor it looks cheap and dirty not a smooth material the kind of good quality cottons that you get these days is amazing this blanket is no where near to it second the honeycomb pattern is not well woven it gets stuck in finger and toe nails and can come off easily would never buy this blanket agai
this is the poorest quality blanket i have ever purchased immediately upon removing it from the packaging there was lint and fibers everywhere every time i put something on top of the blanket it was filled with lint and particles of the blanket i washed it to try to get some of the lint off and while drying i had to clean out the dryer filter 3 times i put it back on the bed and there 's still lint and fibers everywhere i do not want to constantly use a lint brush to remove the lint from my clothes or anything else i put on the bed this blanket was a total waste of money since i can not return it after washing it and throwing out the packaging
the oven came out of the box defective it did not heat at all ! the rotisserie turned the lights came on but no heat at all ! i removed the chicken and tried plain 'ol baking no heat now i have to drag the darn thing back to the store ! no more hamilton beach products for me ! if hamilton beach 's quality control '' does not detect such a major problem how can they detect smaller ones
spend the extra and buy cuisinart i bought the hamilton big mouth in november just in time to use for all the extra cooking i do through the holidays i did n't have the money to spend on a cuisinart at the time so i thought i 'd give the hamilton beach a try after looking at the reviews here now this is my first time using a hamilton beach food processor as i 've worked in professional kitchens and have always used cuisinarts and i 'm used to them being work horses that can plow through any kind of food you process at first things were going great it survived through a thanksgiving for 20 a christmas for 30 with the last thing made was a large batch of gingerbread dough i put the machine away and just brought it out to use for a weekend 's worth of cooking and it 's dead we 've troubleshooted through everything but to no avail i guess this product would be fine if you only cooked occasionally but for the frequent home cook who occasionally also does large meals i 'd seriously suggest getting a better and more sturdy brand
we had the unit for two months before one of the controllers started giving an e 4 error message keep you documentation including receipt and warranty west point has a designed to avoid customer interaction the only way you will find out where to send the broken controller is on the warranty form
i had one that was great for a couple of months then started blinking e '' and some error number got it replaced now after a couple more months the replacement started blinking e '' and 3 '' the error that others have reported will return it again what a piece of junk and for such a high price
we purchased the blanket because we felt it was superior in quality since it costs at least double what common blankets cost it seemed likely that the company had done it right unfortunately the first blanket controller started giving an error within two weeks we followed the instructions to try to reset it and that did n't work we exchanged the blanket hoping the replacement would function properly after three weeks a new controller began displaying the error when we plugged the other side 's controller in it worked we tried to contact the manufacturer to request a new controller and to see it they had addressed the issue with a new design but it was impossible to reach them bottom line is we returned the second blanket and gave up seems like the blanket is high quality and the electronics in the controller are not
i had the same problem as everyone else after less than a month this blanket is useless because of the malfunctioning controller no way to fix and unable to return to amazon because it was ordered longer than 30 days ago xmas gift for one of my roommates what an incredible waste of money the first time in 10 yrs i have been disappointed with amazon service or lack thereof
the blanket worked for 3 weeks now the controller just keeps blinking it wont reset it wont warm i can not return it to amazon it 's been longer than 30 days as i purchased it ahead of time as a christmas gift i wont do that again
this pan is small i have a gas range with heavy grates and this pan was hard to get it to fit even it kept falling through the grates till i could just get it right ! took some time it came with a very good recipe but to me this was such a pain in the neck to make these i just took out my big double calphalon griddle and made pancakes which turned out great and tasted the same as aebleskivers when i did make aebleskivers and put the jam in the middle it seemed to disapeared and i had a hole where the jam was ! ! i then used fresh apples that worked out better but i still like pancakes allot easier to make
i originally went to the store to buy another vornado heater that received good reviews on amazon however the store only had the dvh in stock and it was on sale so i went with the dvh i was excited about bringing it home to heat the living room when i watched tv and my bedroom at night well i tested the unit last night in my bedroom about and it was very disapointing i live in ca and the temp in my house is around 60 degrees between i wanted a heater to heat up my bedroom at night so i could sleep comfortably and i place it in in the bathroom in the morning so i can get out of the shower and not freeze to death this unit 's performance was horrible ! i set the dvh on high and set the temp to 72 degrees before i went to sleep throughout the night the room still felt cold in the morning i looked at the dvh and it states that the room temp was around 63 degrees ! the heater hardly changed the temp of the room the whole night ! i then adjusted the temp to 90 degrees and placed the unit in the bathroom by the end of my shower the room temp was only registering 65 degrees ! ! i left it on for another hour to test and when i came back the room temp hardly changed maybe only by a few degrees ! ! the heat coming from the dvh was not that hot and the fan did not seem that strong needless to say i am returning this heater today ! it seems that the quality control at vornado is not consistent on this heater some people rave about this heater yet many others have similar negative experiences like mine i would recommend staying away from this heater and spend your hard earned money on something better ! hope this review helps
i bought a non digital vornado in the past and it still works fine this digital vornado was fine in the beginning but after a short while the digital temperature readout was scrambled and the fan and heat did n't work i 'll get a replacement vornado but it wo n't be this model
my collar stopped working after 3 months innotek does n't honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer which does n't include amazon
after a few uses the wire stretches and then breaks it is not repairable too bad since they make other good products
the first couple of times i used this cheese slicer the wire stretched out making the slices thicker than they 're supposed to be today i finally cut through a hard hunk of sharp cheddar and pop the wire broke for 20 i expect more next time i 'll buy a cheese slicer very disappointed as i expect more of oxo
like in the other reviews the wire broke after only a few uses i just emailed oxo and asked for a replacement i hope they honor the satisfaction garantee
it does the job while it then the wire went slack and finally broke like everyone else i could call and get a replacement but do i want to bother perhaps i 'll get a replacement and give it away as a gift to someone who will never use it it does look very nice anyone have a recommendation for an alternative product
as several others have noted the wire goes slack and then breaks easily after a short period of time once the wire breaks you have nothing but an expensive handle to throw away this product should be recalled it is of fraudulently poor quality
i thought this was a good slicer until i tried to slice a block of extra sharp cheddar and the wire snapped about halfway through the slice no way to replace the wire so the whole unit is now useless if oxo stands by their warranty i might try to get a new one but until then i am going to use a cheaper adjustable one
i liked the slicer okay but the wire just snapped and i have n't had it but a few months
i purchased the cheese slicer to replace one from the 70 's that finally gave out i pulled out a block of cheddar cheese and tried the new slicer the comfortable handle made holding the slicer a dream but the dream ended quickly the wire broke halfway through the first slice ! unlike my old slicer this one does not have a screw on the side to the existing wire adjust the tension or replace a broken wire oxo 's web site says they guarantee satisfaction so i am going to see if i can actually get it replaced without paying more in shipping than i saved by buying this slicer rather than the fancier one
all the things people say about ceramic cookers are true they are the best way the cook foor whether you want to do traditional bbq low and slow for at 225 degrees or to grill steaks at 700 degrees they keep the heat and moisture in due to the thick ceramic walls and keeping the temperature adjusted is easy whether grilling or barbecue the flavor is unmatched by steel cookers all that said for the same price as this large '' bge you can get a 7 kamado that is much larger has thicker walls and can be had covered with beautiful mosaic tile of your choice not only is it a thing of beauty but it the way it cooks is incredible using a load of kamado natural coconut extruded charcoal it is possible to maintain a constant 225 degrees for more than without adding more charcoal this means you can do traditionl bbq with primal cuts such as full briskets and pork shoulders and sleep through the night while they are cooking
just picked up this thing from a shelf on a wal at a local super mart for 19.88 i brewed a couple cups of coffee using fresh pods i purchased with it not the 8 sample pods that have a best use date of it is terrible first i tried a cup with 2 pods too weak then i tried the setting with again two pods as is suggested for a strong '' cup of coffee swill i am not blaming the folgers pods i dont think because i have had good cups of folgers from my old auto drip but something is awry i will be returning this immediately and stopping off at starbucks to cleanse that horrible taste from my mouth i guess i got what i piad for
pros makes a quick cup of coffee cons i went through two of these very cheap and breaks easily i 'm finding the specialty skinny latte cappuccino hard to come buy usually the ones i find on the store shelves are expired if you really want a black decker home cafe get the newer home caf i also owned one of those senseo coffee makers it would consistently dispense the wrong amount of water resulting in numerous overfills therefore wasting numerous coffee pods so more expensive is n't always better
i agree with most reviewers this coffee maker is a piece of junk the few cups that i made were the worst tasting coffee ever
there is nothing good i can say about this coffee maker it leaks and makes terrible tasting coffee this is by no means a small leak water goes all over the counter the replacement unit i got leaked worse than the first do n't waste your time or money on this product senseo makes a much better single serve coffee maker
i received this coffee maker as a gift two years ago as a mechanical engineer the machine itself makes my heart cry the parts are a flimsy plastic that have been cracking slowly but surely over time the pod holder is difficult to open and it feels like the handle will break if you push the end i have n't had any problems with leaking or lukewarm coffee the coffee itself comes out hot and tastes good the only issue i 've had is cracked parts
i admit that the cup sizes and the reservoir are great but the coffee tastes like plastic this is not good i took this back the next day
i purchased this when it first came out on the market thought it would be great for just one cup of coffee in the morning purchased the cappicino pods from the home cafe website and wanted to try those they didnt fit the top of the machine after you put in the pod wouldnt shut called customer service and was told yes they knew there was a problem and there engineers were working on it took my name and number and said they would get back to me when they had it fixed that 's been over a year ago my question why sell the pods online or even the coffeemaker if they knew there was a problem now all my coffeemaker does is leak all over the place this is going into the trash today dont waste your money on this coffeemaker spend a little more and get something you know will work
the first item i received was highly dented this is because the packaging is so inadequate for this type of item since it was to be used outside i sucked it up figuring it was was easier than returning the unit then the item dod not work so i had to return it the next refrigerator i received was damamged again but much less than the first one and it worked so i kept it i read other complaints about the packaging of this item but purchased anyway thinking it was it 's not sanyo really needs to work this out as i am sure 90 of the refrigerators that are sent out become dented if they are all packaged the way mine were the fridge works fine but does need frequent defrosting
this teapot is not the greatest when pouring it leaks and you end up with tea stains on your counter
yes it is a nice pot i can understand why it would be perfect for painting designs and whatnot but for making tea i find it to have a fatal flaw the handle heats up as much as the rest of the pot and thus in order to pour boiling water i need to use a pot holder which is awkward so if you buying this to throw on a shelf i think it would be fine if you want to be pouring boiling liquids from it you might want to look elsewher
believe it or not there was red stuff inside ! ! ! ! ! today i unscrew my brita ultra faucet filter system '' well i was shocked to discover that inside the faucet mount and on both water mouths there was red stuff growing i called brita and was told that it is not the product since it is not even designed to filter out bacteria it must be the water long story short brita still pushes it product on people who does n't know better this product is poorly designed and drains bad therefore bacteria or other nasty things could multiply in it since it doesnt filter out bacteria the scenario is not a pleasant one if you buy this system it means that you dont know a lot about water filters and what you want to filter out neither did i you have to be a chemist to understand the lingo stay away since this product may be harmfull to your health by its poor quality
it does n't fit my tub and is too short i thought it would be standard but i guess i was wrong
if you only need to hang a dozen blouses on this hanger it might be ok but if you need to hang a dozen pairs of jeans choose a different product
i decided to get the bissell flip ease over the competing swiffer product because of the reusable pads when i compared the two that was the only real difference i saw between them and it seemed worthwhile to pay a little more to avoid paying for disposable pads with four kids and one big linoleum floor i really needed a product like this i only had it a month the vacuum worked alright at first and i loved the cordless feature the problem was after about thirty days the battery would not hold a charge for any longer than thirty seconds no matter how long i left it on charge in the documentation it says that the battery should last five to seven years it may just be that i got a faulty product but having used it i just do n't think it 's worth the money i spent i saved the packaging and the receipt and intend to get a refund or credit for another product the mop feature is disappointing and within a few uses i found it was best used for light clean up such as spraying the floor with cleaner in a spray bottle and then using the mop to wipe up small messes the material it vacuums is very small the filter clogs very quickly and it needs frequent changes i really wish it had worked out better because the function promises were so enticing i 'd like to keep the pads or just purchase them separately though because for dry floor dusting they actually work fairly well better than swiffer disposables in my opinion
the previous owner of my home said they were the best ha ! ! ! the vac worked some but only on tiny particles bigger stuff just pushes around and the mop a bigger mess than i had in the first place ! ! and my house smells like a big wet dog ! ! ughhh ! ! very disapointed i 'm gon na go back to my old trick of old using terry cloth rags on the swiffer wet jet in place of my mop saves on costly pad replacement and works better anyhow and a seperate vac i was trying to get the two in one conveinence nevermind ! ! ! avoid ! ! ! do n't waste your dough on this one ! ! !
i bought this while in search of a replacement for my badly missed bissell steam mop which is no longer made while the cordless feature is great it does a rather poor job of mopping a floor the actual mop '' part is only a small velcroed microfiber cloth over a hard plastic head which does n't absorb any major dirt or mess stick vac part is ok one bright spot was it came with a small bottle of bissell floor cleaner which as it turns out is a good product but i was not very impressed with this as a useful cleaning device so back to the store it goes !
i went to get the swiffer sweeper vac and ended up buying this i thought wow what a good idea you can vac and mop with one product no way it does not work ! i filled up the tank and when i placed it on the mop the whole tank spilled out ok i thought it was just my fault so i did it again same thing when i finally got some of the water to stay in the tank i mopped oh my terrible water gets into the vac canister and all it does is push around the dirt it streaks badly and that cloth you get with it does n't come clean the only positive is the way it vacs stuff up but it is not worth keeping it for just that i am taking it back after everything dries
first of all i would give it zero stars if possible this is the worst thing we have ever bought our first cup was fine it started leaking right after that now it wo n't even brew the expresso it is leaking down the sides spend the money on a good machine and yes we got two sets of expresso grounded very fine at starbucks and it still does not work
this was my second cappuccino maker and after 1 use i am returning it it feels really the knob to turn it from espresso to steam feels like it will break very soon it only makes 1 cup at a time and does n't get the milk very frothy like my last one did i got it on sale but it still was n't worth 69 i 'll spend more if i can find one that does n't feel like it was built by a kid
the power filtration system motor burns out in about 1 year eclipse does not sell the system as a separate accessory so you ca n't replace the item without buying a whole new aquarium system
i reviewed most of the juicers on and many other major sites and decided that the kitchenaid was the best product on the market after receiving it i changed my mind although it promises to be an easy cleanup with a special tool '' it is way too hard to clean up the pulp basket contains a ridge that makes it next to impossible to get out all of the little strains of pulp the special tool is great for getting out the big stuff but not the little stuff also there is a ton of juice left over in the pulp that gets thrown away this is a result of the poor design which filters the juice through the pulp before exiting the product had a nice design and looked good on my but it did not deliver i would recommend buying jack lalanne 's power juicer that is available on other sites
i 've given up on this product after using it for several months in various rooms as it seems to make no appreciable difference in stopping or limiting my cat spraying
i received this item as a gift and had to return it due to the plates being broken the replacement was sent but the plates in the replacement were broken so i ordered another set that arrived broken until the packaging changes i would recommend choosing a different brand
do not buy plates from amazon ! do n't get me wrong i love amazon and have had no other problems with their services but this was crazy i ordered these plates and they came in a box with a piece of brown paper as packing material ! ! then i returned them and the set had some bubble wrap but not nearly enoough broken again ! ! not worth the time or money ! i must also say that i ordered several other glass kitchen items and they were fine
nice and soft but boy oh boy do they loose a lot in the i think if i wash these about 12 times they will disappear
i have had this cabinet for about six months the doors when filled with cd 's sag and can not be realigned this problem must be common as one other reviewer had the same problem
i purchased this item after doing a lot of research on av storage units i decided at the end of the day that the size and look of this one was the way i wanted to go i received the unit and put the shelves in the way i wanted the main problem with this unit as i soon discovered is that the doors ca n't really hold any amount of weight even after i switched off the cd 's i had in the doors to half cd half dvd they still are crooked and off kilter the weight of the disks causes the doors to scrape the base and not line up correctly when closed this makes the unit nearly useless in my opinion unless you want to make the doors all dvd i hate the way it looks damaged and sloppy i am kicking myself for choosing this item for pure aesthetics i merely assumed i was getting quality as well due to the price for this size unit but that was not the case i would n't buy or reccomend this product unless you have low expectations and ca n't do with any other look for your decor
when i first purchased these towels i was very happy they were soft and luxurious after a couple of months of use i am very sorry i ever purchased them while they are still thick they have lost any softness they had they are now great for exfoliating also here 's the strange part the decorative border of the towels has shrunk 11 full inches in width the towels are now ruffled on the ends yes i did follow the instructions on the care label they were a terrible waste of money if you would like to purchase a truly luxurious towel try charisma egyptian cotton towels i have owned these in the past and will be what i replace the ruffled sanding towels with they are worth the extra few dollars
one of the plate i bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat microwaving so i doubt it is really good for microwave when i called lenox their simply asked if i want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem disguesting the design pattern was nice though
when the box was opened a strong lacquer odor was present and the grinder had to be aired out for several days the grinder is crudely constructed and therefore crudely grinds beans the finest grind that could be obtained was course with some half and even whole beans falling through multiple telephone and email messages were not answered by the
ok the rating is based on the description not on the product but how should i know if this is the right product if i ca n't tell what size it is
this tool holder is fairly bulky i could n't find the single strong metal ones i was looking for and thought this would be a good substitute it does n't hold out broom or mop they slide out so it is now holding two tennis rackets would not purchase again
bought 2 from walmart to hang up brooms and stuff in the garage both had small pieces of plastic already broken off in the package one was broken enough that the moving gripper fell right out i drilled the holes to install the second since despite finding two shards of plastic in the package it the drywall anchors provided do n't work you drill the holes in the drywall i went undersize on the hole by to ensure a better fit and they tap in fine but the screws do n't spread the anchors in the drywall to keep them gripping instead the anchor just spins and the holder hangs a bit loose from the wall and without good grip i easily pulled the holder and anchors right out of the wall both are going to walmart for a refund
the table arrived with only a base and no table top i am waiting for a response to see why this keeps happening i am very unsatisfied with the product
the base arrived broken the box was marked 2 of 2. i did not recieve 1 of 2. i have a table base but no table top also the base was poorly packed and arrive broken i will attempt to reorder this aprears to be reoccuring theme
i too received this table with no base not only that there was inadequate packing materials and the table top was cracked and falling apart as a result why does n't amazon pull this too bad because it would have been a nice piece if company knew how to ship properly
we ordered this table twice and both times it shipped with out a base amazon assured us the table would be complete the second time we ordered it but we still ended up with a top and no base we were told the shippment from the carolina table and chair company was to blame and the table would be pulled from amazon until they got the complete table it is still on the web site and i suspect it is still incomplete
this pillow was a disappointment it 's advertised as 'firm ' but it 's not it 's like sleeping on mush there 's no support at all do n't buy this if you are looking for a firm pillow
it took almost a month the actually get what i ordered i was charged for them the day after i bought them and heard nothing from the company for over two weeks then it said it shipped but a week later there was still no tracking number and no package very dissapointed in the customer service at least i got what i ordered
the furniture itself is fine or rather it would be if it was shipped properly before ordering anything from target think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return if you receive something damaged and you will be prepared for an extensive return process chances are the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well this happened to me twice if you 're lucky you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments this however will take time additionally even if the piece is not cracked you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood i bought the desk the hutch and the bookcase all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier after waiting and waiting and calling target on several occasions someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment even though other pieces arrived without such complications quite honestly this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax this is not so much a deal '' but a waste of time and money
i was so looking forward to receiving this desk when we unpacked it we saw that the desk had been completely broken off on one corner and then reglued and shipped to me now no one will take responsibility and as amazon has no live people at their customer service number they expect me to ship it back to them i have never been so furious over a purchase in my entire life
i do not recommend anyone to buy this for personal use the towel set is the thinnest that you can ever imagine this is not a quality jacquard thick brazilian towels that you 'll find in the store this is only good for wiping or dusting the house not for personal use
towels are supposed to be absorbent these swoosh the water across your body not good towels pretty just for show '' though
ugly and cheap looking wife hated them now using as rags to wash the ca
the problem for me with this beautiful beechwood lazy susan was this no edge around the perimeter to keep the various condiments etc from sliding off
this product leaks from the inferior quality plastic compartments i returned the extra few dollars and bought cuisinart version my opinion is that for 20 more cuisinart makes the same product but manufactures it 200 better allowing me to enjoy my morning coffee perfectly brewed without cleaning my kitchen counter from coffee that has leaked out from the warming unit
when you first get the brewstation it works great it 's really convenient i bought one for my mom last christmas 2005 and she loved it one day i walked into the kitchen and noticed coffee all over the counter around the brewstation i whiped it up and did n't give it another thought but the next day i went back and there was coffee all over the counter again it was then i noticed that the spout had developed a leak my mom said she had n't a clue what was wrong with it so we cleaned it and sit it on the dining room table for about 2 months unused yesterday i went back to it and figured it was probably the gasket around the spout i found the replacement gasket that came with it and replaced it i then cleaned it off and placed it back on the counter and filled it with water i ran it with just plain water to see if it would leak and at first it did n't then after it got up to about 6 cups it began dripping again bummer so i left it sitting there and put a paper towl under it and when i went back about 20 minutes later the paper towel was soaked the bottom line is the brewstation my be convenient and have great features but you would be better buying a 10 traditional coffee maker at your local dollar store
i thought this product was great at first but after a few months it started leaking after a few days of coming home to a coffee covered counter i went out and bought a coffee this one is not worth the mess
this is my second brew station i have finally learned my lesson the first one leaked until the electronics failed 6 months the second one has leaked from day on i think this i am going back to the old reliable coffeee
i loved the design so decided to buy it 4 yes 4 coffee makers later in one year i have given up on getting another one all of the four have had problems with the electronics the coffee will brew and then instead of going to warming the machine shuts off and and starts blinking as if it is in the timed setting the clock itself stops competely and the coffe gets cold the machine is locked in that mode and the only way to get it back out is to unplug it and reset time timer one of the four just completely died after doing the routine once at first i could not believe that we got that many lemons so i bought a surge protecter for the outlet that did not stop it from going into the same routine so i do not believe the cause was other than poor quality the warranty is for one year but you have to send the machine to them which involves a shipping expense so beware of that also there is also a problem with the handle breaking and it does leak i would put up with the leak if the thing would just work otherwise

never got a chance to use this bake serve set the first time i ordered it was received smashed into many pieces the packaging was barely there for a glass product amazon was nice enough to send me another replacement immediately although the shipping packaging was better part of it arrived broken again if this product ca n't handle even being shipped how long will it last in the kitchen i have sinced asked for my money back too heavy to keep returning damaged goods to the post office
this is falsely advertised these are cereal bowls i had them replace and they sent cereal bowls again do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is cute and kitschy but too small and overpriced they are n't kidding around putting in the name of this item it 's way too big to make individual servings of cake with and yet not nearly large enough to use up anywhere near one full sized cake 's batter you would need at least four or five of these to use up the typical cake 's batter for that price you can buy a full sized bear cake pan and have money left over
i ordered this item on because i was gone over a weekend and somehow my roomates managed to gunk up my tank royally i went to petsmart in person and they did n't have these filters that i need so i ordered these i ended up not getting them until the middle of november that 's over a month ! ! ! ! i called customer service for petsmart and the only thing they told me was they would cancel the order and i could go get them from the store basic they did absolutly nothing i would not recommend ordering from petsmart unless you do n't need what you 're ordering for a couple of months
i bought this item to house my crickets for my hungry beardies and panther chameleon unfortunately though crickets can and do escape from this item my son was wondering what was crawling on him in the middle of the night and we discovered crickets all over his room i tried placing the cricket keeper in the bathtub and sure enough when i returned later there were crickets in the tub that had escaped and yes the lid was snapped tight and the two tubes had their covers on them now i have to keep the keeper tied up in plastic bags when crickets are inside until i can find another cricket keeper so unless you want to be a kricket wrangler
i read all of the great reviews that this product had but i encountered nothing but problems first the pieces it came with did not fit my tank the short attachment was too short and the long attachment was way too long so i had to cut it the pump is not strong enough to pull the water up through the attachment no matter how much i cut it and even with it off the pump had major problems the product just did not perform as the manufacturer or other customers had testified to it was way loud and kept up my kids atnight who slept in the next room i was not impressed and changed back to the free filter that came with the tank the tetra whisper brand
this thermometer gives completely inaccurate readings unless you have at least the first 1.5 inches in the food if any part of that sensor area is exposed to air the reading will be way low so if you 're using it for something like peanut brittle or fudge chances are your boiling liquids wo n't be deep enough to get accurate readings however it 's a fairly sturdy device and reads very quickly so would probably be great for deep fat frying and meats
i was given the fryer as christmas gift we used it twice worked perfectly great features pretty idotic proof in being able to set time and temp third try the led on the control unit started flashing random numers letters and symbols the reset never functioned all heating element failed essentially a total meltdown called delonghi they requested i send the unit to a service center in new mexico which i did a month later no unit no response from service center
i bought this fryer 3 months ago and was thrilled with it at first it has all the features i was looking for in particular that it was fully washable and it had a drain spout the only thing i did n't like was that the temperature selections were and i could n't vary the temp to exactly what i wanted it was n't that big of a deal though but after using the machine about a month i started getting an error message on the led screen and the machine would shut off i always reset it pretty quickly so i could continue to use it the messages came more and more often and today i can not use the machine at all it instantly goes to the error message and i can not use it and i can not cook my lunch the way i wanted to i 'm very disappointed that this machine did n't even last me 3 whole months i 've emailed delonghi i hope they 'll help i never send in product registrations but i think this time i 've learned my lesson
the furniture itself is fine or rather it would be if it was shipped properly before ordering anything from target think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return if you receive something damaged and you will be prepared for an extensive return process chances are the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well this happened to me twice if you 're lucky you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments this however will take time additionally even if the piece is not cracked you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood i bought the desk the hutch and the bookcase all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier after waiting and waiting and calling target on several occasions someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment even though other pieces arrived without such complications quite honestly this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax this is not so much a deal '' but a waste of time and money
i liked this cute little tag when i got it though i ca n't speak to its reflectiveness as i never let my puppy out in the street at night however in little over a month my puppy managed to chew it beyond recognition the letters are no longer readable and i 'm going to have to order a new tag this time i 'll go for a metal one
this is a poor product it never manages to really get the air out of a bottle of wine which you can tell because there is no real pop '' when you remove the stopper and after a few months mine broke find another brand
the paw works but the quality is very low it is made out of cheap plastic and i found paper stuck inside the bell rings randomly as others have noted the random ringing happens if the button gets stuck down it does n't always pop back up after it is pushed it is n't even water resistent for those thinking of putting it outside the intercom part works fine and seems to be of decent quality the barking option is just irritating though
in december 2002 i purchased the pet chime and paw two additional paws i was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks in the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by lentek they 're great if they work
i just got this from amazon working on returning there is no range between the paw and doorbell chime even at 2 3 feet away with brand new batteries it seems to have issues i thought it would be more usable than a hanging bell and easier to install with less holes and hardware the paw is more like a toy so you have to mount it and since there is no range u have to mount the reciever directly above it with the range of the one i have it would of made sense to combine the two
bought this micro in 2006 and by 2006 was having big time problems this microwave oven is a fire hazard ! the one i bought started arcing like an arc welder between the door and the body of the microwave sanyo 's no custumer service '' was anything but helpful ! do n't buy any sanyo products since they are junk and they will not stand behind their product
i bought this machine and a dyson the same day this one i bought for our lower level family room after assembly i found it was very hard to operate and heavy ! i now see why they store models are put so high up out of the consumers reach the upolstry tool is worthless i find the dust and debis collects around the filter until the machine will absolutely clog up and stop the dyson worth every penny and i should have bought 2
we 've had this vacuum less than a year this bissell worked great for the first few weeks then the pedal that holds it upright broke then it started losing suction despite emptied canisters and cleaned filters we also notices a fine layer of dust on vacuum no matter how many times we wiped it clean now the motor is acting up i even changed the belt though it looked fine without any results i 'm afraid it will catch on fire because of how fast the motor is running now it makes a sickly whine our only choices are to have it repaired or buy a different brand we 're thinking of going with a dyson or a kenmore now
i ca n't believe what a useless waste of space this vacuum cleaner '' is i 've had it less than a year on the use the first belt broke it goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes the hose wo n't consistently stay clamped to the handle falling into your knees as you try to push the thing i ca n't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as i try to unclog it its a step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a asthma attack and my asthma is pretty mild its going to the curb on the next trash because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and i do n't even know how that managed to happen i guess at about 90 you get what you pay for those dyson 's better be worth the because i 'm getting one tomorrow
mine worked good enough for window cleaning until it stopped making steam after first 30 min use
i bought the shark with hopes that it would save my kitchen and bathroom from hard to reach grime and stains that would n't come off any other way it was sadly only a mediocre help to my housework the shark does a good job of removing the grime that lives around faucet handles and in the jam of the refrigerator but i found it totally useless when trying to clean the stove or any expanse of tiles that was more than three or four inches the process of cleaning takes so long a person would go mad before they cleaned all of the tiles in the bathroom ! i was thrilled to buy this product but it did n't live up to my hopes and dreams
i bought this toaster for about 11 so i did not expect much i have n't tried it yet so i ca n't say how it works but i want to warn potential buyers that if you buy a reconditioned item it can come with some parts missing mine came without a cookie sheet and a little thingie for pulling hot trays out also the dials are somewhat misaligned not a big deal especially given the price but had i bought it for more money i would 've been pissed
tried to install batteries for first use and battery latch and switch fell to pieces in my hand complete piece of junk do n't waste your
shortly i had no negative feelings about the work of this humidifier the only problem was that while it was really quiet most of the time at certain periods it started to roar pretty noisy it woke me up one night but it did n't happen often then after 2 weeks it stopped working probably that roaring was the sign of some existing deffect i sent it back to amazon and ordered a new one not honeywell this time
received this oven as a wedding gift and enjoyed it for approximately nine months it cooked fairly evenly offered convection speed and looked attractive in chrome unfortunately like many reviewers on rival 's sister unit the we started experiencing problems with the control knobs getting stuck in our case it was the all important timer knob which would freeze while cooking and counting down the unit is fairly quiet and if you are n't paying close attention and who is during the morning rush then suddenly your bagel has been broiling for and is nearly on fire ! given the other reviews on rival countertop ovens this is obviously not a problem isolated to just our unit rival did make a digital touchpad version of this oven but it has been discontinued and even if it were available a call to rival revealed that they were only willing to replace our unit with the exact same model no thanks ! taking the recommendation of a major consumer magazine we 've purchased a cuisinart with digital timer and would highly recommend it
i bought 4 of the chenille pillows and they have all came apart at the seams the lasted maybe a couple of months these pillows are for looks only not ever to be used
this is the most rediculous vacuum i have ever owned at first i thought wow what a buy it had such wonderful suction i soon changed my mind after about 10 vacuums it would n't pick up anything from the carpet i have had it about a yr now and it has n't worked correctly for the past 9 months but i did n't have the money to buy another at that time so i suffered and boy did i suffer i have an inside dog and hate dog hair so i was on my hands and knees trying to use the attachments in desperation to remove some of the hair i would not recommend this vacuum to anyone it is terrible ! my husband always tells '' you get what you pay for '' and in the case of this vacuum i could n't agree more ! it was cheap and it performed cheap ! nobody should have to purchase a vacuum every year that 's ridiculous ! ! ! i decided to study up on my purchase this time and look at reviews reviews and boy has it paid off i ended up purchasing the eureka boss smartvac and can i say ! so if your looking for a wonderful lasting vacuum with excellent performance i highly recommend the eureka and not the dirt devil ! its terrible ! the dirt devil also throws dirt back at you and when you empty the canister after vacuuming the dust goes right back into your house and the hepa filter does no good in that case so you end up wasting your money on hepa filters also and on the model i have the hose has to be removed from this hole to use it and when you remove the hose more than a couple times it becomes lose '' and will not stay in the proper place and comes out constantly which in return causes loss of suction and also causes the dirt your vacuuming up to be thrown right back in the floor ugh ! ! ! not a good experience for me and i will never waste my money on dirt devil again i might as well burn my money and save myself the frustrations
i bought this vacuum less than a year ago and use it weekly or on a small apartment with cats it was very loud so much that it scares the dickens out of the cats but it worked well until three months ago that 's when its suction was working less and less i kept thinking wow i have to vacuum more often maybe the cats are shedding '' or i ca n't believe how dirty we 've been lately '' as it turns out the vacuum was n't really picking up items so much as it was either redistributing them around the carpet or collecting them in the nozzle as soon as i 'd turn it off to store it things came out all over the place i 'm frustrated to have to buy yet another vacuum in less than a year 's time no more dirt devils for me
i hate this vacuum like others said it 's loud and no not all vacuums are this loud to the point where i wonder if i 'm getting hearing damage the worst thing though is how heavy it is i have area rugs and the vaccum does n't just glide over them it gets caught so i have to pick it up and drop it down on the spot i want to vacuum my back usually hurts after i finish vacuuming finally it does n't do a thing to pick up cat hair i 've resorted to getting on my hands and knees with the attachment and going over the area rug an inch at a time as soon as possible i am going to get rid of this useless thing
i bought this vacuum after a series of decidedly poor vacuums thinking that being a college student this was expensive ! a little bit more money might yield better results the first two this worked incredibly i 'd never seen such sucking power ! the swivel was mighty the light on the front was a big improvement on my old vacuum and the thing picked up everything in sight in one fell swoop no running over a spot again and again then the third time there were rubbery odors my cat 's hair remained permanently pressed into the rug and a simple bit of confetti was not even touched when i ran over it upon opening the vacuum the belt was absolutely charred ! i 'm going to try replacing the belt and see how long it lasts but i fear after reading other reviews of this item that i 'm going to be in the market for another vacuum again ! sending the thing back to dirt devil would cost me more than it 's worth never buy anything like this without reading online reviews first stupid me in the cleaning aisle at target
i bought this vac a year ago and it worked great at first picking up all the stuff you see on those vaccum commercials big paper clips staples about two months ago this thing went way downhill in terms of performance it would pick things up but they would n't go into the canister everything just got stuck in the hose i would then have to shake the hose out on to the floor somewhat defeating the purpose of vaccuming and pick up the big clumps of dirt that had formed in the hose with my hands today when i started vaccuming it spit out pieces of dirt from the last time i vacced on to the floor which i then had to vac up again think it 's time i put this thing and myself out of misery
i thought the dishes were beautiful when i saw them on line however when i received them at home they were very poorly packed and were broken ! ! ! i am handicapped and it is hard for me to get around then i had to lug this big package to a post office to return them ! never order anything that is breakable ! !
i got this baby home and plugged it in the indicator light for the smaller burner did not light up it was apparently broken out of the box the temperature control knobs are almost as if they are on a child 's cooktop there is no definitive click '' for off so i would be worried that it gets bumped on '' but still i loved the look of it so i tried to cook with it it took 24 minutes to bring about 2.5 quarts of water to a boil and this was in a highly conductive copper pot guess what it 's going back and an interesting side point the rival website does n't list this as one of their products my guess is that it was discontinued because it was engineered so poorly
a complete and utter waste of money the rival double burner hot plate worked exactly half of one time i bought this because we were remodeling our home and we needed something to cook on in the temporary kitchen the contractor set up for us thinking a double burner hot plate would be a good and inexpensive solution for our kitchen '' i ordered this from amazon who promptly delivered it a couple of days later i plugged it in and waited and waited and waited for an interminable amount of time while the unit heated up i could n't tell if the unit was on because the light indicating power to the burner was n't working but i felt some heat rising from the element so no big deal anyway after about 15 minutes it got to a medium warm temperature despite the fact that i had it set to high and i started to cook my kids some eggs i made it through two of the boys breakfasts when the unit shut down and would n't start up again the long and short of it do n't buy this piece of junk it 's not worth the bandwidth or even postage to send it back to amazon for a refund rival should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of quality control in their products get a clue rival !
i had high hopes for these space bags i bought several in advance of our move i think two of them worked as in stayed sealed and compressed the rest would not stay sealed no matter what we did i would not buy these again i wish i had saved the money
these bags never hold the air out and are constantly reverting back to the original big shape because they ca n't seem to stay sealed well also the material is very flimsy and half my bags ripped or got holes from nothing more that regular attempted use i sent them back when they were n't sealing and received a new set thinking they have a wonderful 100 guarantee not ! the new bags had the same issue which leads me to believe this is just an inferior product great idea and it works at first but if they can fix it to stay sealed and make it of tougher material i may consider trying one inthe future if not save your money
feels like sleeping on a rock hard like a rock i wake up everyday with a headache i slept much better with my old 10 year old pillow
i have no idea where they came up with 3 cups on this because it will only take about 8 oz of water they must mean cups it is really too small to use if you are making more than just one small cup of coffee i love the idea of a french press '' coffee maker but after you bring your water to a boil pour it over the grounds let it set for about 5 minutes then press it out i would like to have more to show for my time and effort
it is definitely not for 3 cups it is a mini french press for 1 cup of coffee i was shocked to see the size other than that it works
i purchased this particular french press two months ago i was delighted as it stated that it was 'top rack dishwasher safe ' however despite diligently following those precious directions the press came apart without any hope of salvation as i went to press my coffee the beaker was fine but the broken press left me with a nice cup of sludge something that feeds such a vital addiction as the morning cup of coffee should not fall apart when one needs it the most
100 for a casserole dish you have got to be kidding i do n't care how good it is for 100 it better load itself up walk itself over to the oven turn it on and get in i pity anyone who buys this 100 is bad enough but look at it what 's wrong with cookware that looks like cookware
the down from the comforter is coming out causing lot of discomfort and allergy
well may be it 's just my SMILE seriously i am still chopping vegetables manually this thing is good to make a mess or puree of anything you have you can use it sometimes if you cook for yourself only and do n't mind the look of results although even in this case you will arguably spend more time cleaning the chopper so honestly you do n't want this buy a good knife or a grater
hate this griddle everything sticks and has done since i bought it i have tried everything i can think of to get it to work without success it does not heat evenly and is the worst appliance i have ever bought i plan to return it
after using this product and finding it totally unsatisfactory i checked this site to see how others rated it just in case our bad experience was unusual but of course all the other buyers were just as disgusted as we are the griddle never stays hot enough to be of use and the section smoked and gave off a smell of burning plastic there should have been a recall black and decker should be ashamed i 'll never buy any of their products again
we tried this griddle it worked just fine once after that everything stuck pancakes were n't turnable just made a mess ditto with sausage bacon etc pretty bad at the edges cool in the middle going to buy another brand asap
i also hate this griddle ! it has a very poor surface i keep hoping it 'll season but after 3 months i 'm giving up i also tried rival and they are even worse ! i will try presto based on someone else review
i 've had this griddle for maybe a year and use it times a month yesterday i noticed a smell and then saw smoke coming from where you plug the cord into the griddle i got to it before it started a fire my had the same problem with his a few months ago this griddle should be recalled it is a saftey hazard ! !
i just threw this thing in the garbage after 12 months and wish i would have done so 11 months ago '' coating was peeling off which i am sure is not a healthy addition to your pancakes heating was very uneven hot right under the perimeter and cool in the center made in china
i make pancakes almost every day its one of the only things my toddler will eat and it usually cooks one side but for some reason turns off when i flip them half the time it nevers cooks evenly and every day i have to adjust the heat settings to make the same old pancakes i 'm replacing this as soon as i can afford
black and decker should simpy stay out of the appliance business and stick with what they do best this grill is simply junk just threw it out after a few weeks got a presto gral instead much better this black and decker grill says it is non stick not ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! you better have a big can of pam if you are going to use this grill hard to clean will never be clean again after the first use an ok job of cooking but i wanted an item that was non stick buy the presto cool touch grill instead in fact it appears that in general it is best to stay away from kitchen appliances made by black and decker this is the second product of theirs in a month that i threw away i need to start saving receipts so i can return junky items back to walmart
i 've had this for only a couple months and this grill is horrible headache and as soon as i can afford to replace it its going in the trash i should have stayed with presto i had 2 of thier grills that i used constantly until the non stick surface was worn out and each of them lasted over a year and a half before that happened but they always heated evenly never did i have the problems with them and especially when i 've only had it a couple months and its surfaces looks worse than either of not only do i have to put everything on 400 degrees to get any sort of heat it does not cook evenly the entire center of the grill wo n't get hot enough to grill and the heat sensor will not only not turn on without jiggling it countless times when it does finally heat up it wont stay hot and turns off mid cooking my food and i have to rejiggle the element to get it to re turn i also wish i would have read these reviews before purchasing i was going to get a presto but this one had a cheap price so i got it instead cause i was trying to get a good big mistake ! ! ! awaiting the day i can throw this horrible waste of money the heating surface is large and i like the warming it does work but that is save your money
i really liked this machine the espresso was very good and the steamer heated quicky it broke less than two years after purchase for the cost of the i expect more longevity since i am beyond the warranty the repair is at my expense which is estimated to be 300 plus shipping and handling both directions around 20 each way which is almost the cost of a new machine so in spite of the nice brew i ca n't recommend this machine it 's simply too costly for you and the environment to purchase a machine that breaks so quickly
i have now purhcased two francis units and both have failed the first unit where the brass pipe goes into the pressure tank yes it literally there and destroyed the unit this happned on the fith use of the unit the second unitl worked perfectly for 6 months noow it too has failed it does not heat up and a seal appears to be broke and the unit will not reach brewing or steaming temperature for a 600 espresso machine this is rediculous ! i would advise anyone against buying one of these machines
this thing has big numbers on it but is not very accurate at least 10 off in temp and humidity spend your money on something else like a cheap scientific therm
i used this machine twice the first time it worked like a charm by the second use it was deteriorating and when i attempted a it was unusable the internal parts are as thin as tinfoil and bend out of place very easy and unfortuneatly do n't bend back making the machine useless spend a bit more and get something that will last
my 200 roomba which i loved to use daily for picking up dog hair stopped charging after 8 months i was appalled to find that a new battery was and delayed buying one for a long time i finally caved got the new battery charged it and used it once for 20 minutes and it has n't charged since what a disappointment and waste of money
the description claims that these scissors are good for use in the kitchen but i think that needs some clarification the cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long ! the torque engineering '' that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage other than that there is nothing really different compared to 'regular ' scissors when the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge the pivot is a simple rivet pretty basic and cheap for a relatively expensive pair of scissors such a simple rivet also means that you ca n't take the blades apart the scissors do work ok as regular scissors for cutting paper plastic packaging etc but no more so than any other reasonably well made and possibly less expensive design
this may be a good pan but someone needs to improve the packaging used for shipping both of the units i ordered came broken with cracked handles
i am not pleased with the quality of these knives they break and dull easily
i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel '' let 's be realistic these knives are cheap they 're thin and they 're not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that 's what you 're getting i these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and did n't hear back i finally got their address from the post office and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them with minute wait times for each call to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i 'm going to finish my sentence '' so their rep would stop talking they wo n't refund my money in fact they wo n't refund anyone 's money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they 'll send me another set of knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can
unfortunately i did n't see the other feedback on this item i concur with the other buyer the item you receive is not the item pictured i did find the dimensions in the description but this is a huge platter like for a whole ham or turkey not for a typical main dish presentation hope they change the image
i am very disappointed with this knife tray it is best described as shoddy
product is stapled together does n't seem to be consistent with the quality of other wusthof products
i enjoyed using this press and it greatly reduced time spent ironing my clothes it was perfect until one day it started smoking and then caught fire it was not even two years old but was past the warranty guess i will need a new one but it wo n't be this brand
i bought this as a gift the recipe box was in 4 different pieces when i opened it the shipment box was not damaged it looks like they took a broken recipe box put it in a cardboard box and shipped it to me i called the customer service number left a message and never heard back i would not buy this box nor anything else from this company i am extremely disastified if i do not hear back from lipper international i 'm going to report them to amazon
the duvet is barely flannel it is so thin i ca n't believe it was advertised as flannel the sham is much thicker than the duvet it was also received with a layer of thick dust on the folded up duvet even though it was zipped up in a clear plastic bag i would recommend staying away from this product
i purchased this item from an appliance store in my city though pictured here and elsewhere with a stainless steel carafe it actually comes with a glass pot with a plastic black handle the carafe has a defect and breaks easily while cleaning the inside due to pressure from a screw attaching a steel rim to the bottom of the pot i called lg after my first pot cracked and was told a replacement glass pot would be 56 ! because it was still under warranty they offered me a complimentary replacement '' but i did n't receive it for over 10 weeks and several phone calls after that the same cracking problem occured the first time i tried to clean the second pot other than just rinsing with water this time i noticed that online the pictures seemed to show a stainless steel pot so i called lg parts to see if i could order the stainless steel carafe and was told that there is not such a thing so although the convenience of having a combo appliance was great the hassle of replacing a defective yet highly overpriced carafe every couple of months is not worth it i feel that this product would be worth it if it actually did come with a stainless steel carafe but do n't count on it
we registered for this to replace our old george foreman grill and i thought it would be nice to be able to take out the plates and put them in the dishwasher it did not crisp or cook our food as well things tended to stay soft and just get warm and the plates never got fully clean in the dishwasher anyway i had to ask my mom to give me back my george forman grill i 'll never stray again
it 's very cute but it did n't work you 'd wind it up and it would just sit there not moving despite all sorts of prodding i opened it up and managed to pry a metal coil away from the plastic casing against which it seemed to be rubbing it worked for a couple of weeks after that but eventually went back to not working too
very cute worked for a little while but when it fell off the bathroom vanity that was that it never worked again not that you should throw your timers around or anything but i think a timer should be worth at least one fall do n't you
if you want something that looks like an apple i suggest you buy a real apple if you want a kitchen timer something that reminds you when the time is up then this product is definitely not for you we were extremely disappointed that it does n't make any sound whatsoever when the time is up however it did make a pleasing smash noise when we threw it out of the window !
this vacuum is light and has good suction true and i did n't have any difficulty finding the bags the problem is that the wands and brush are not threaded and have no locking mechanism so they are constantly detaching in vacuuming any given room i typically have to stop pick up the pieces and jam them back together times it 's absolutely infuriating i 've considered them together but then of course i 'd lose the flexibility of using them separately very disappointing purchase i should have sent it back right away
as the title says this is a super cute vacuum cleaner with a comfortable handle but it has only a floor cleaning tool and a crevice tool no tools for cleaning upholstery or curtains why on earth not i 'm having to return it because with dogs i really need those features
it blows the dirt around and it does n't matter how many times i go over the carpet i end up just going back and picking up debris by hand
i have a apartment with hardwood in the living room and bedrooms linoleum in the kitchen and tile in the bath i have four area carpets two and two the apartment collects its fair share of dust but since it 's just me there is minimal traffic my swiffer electric broom that i got at the grocery store does a marvelous job of keeping everything clean and tidy i 've even used the swiffer on the carpets but because it does n't slide easily over the carpets i have to remove the dust cloth and essentially get down on the carpet on my hands and knees to manually run it over the carpet surface i decided to buy a separate stick vacuum that could do a better job well i wish i had heeded the negative reviews on this product it is very loud indeed louder than my old bissell traditional carpet vacuum which long ago became so clogged that it is no longer functional the noise really is painful to the ears it blows dust and dirt away rather than sucking it up you do have to vacuum over and over on the same spot to get it to pick anything up same thing on my hardwoods linoleum and tile it just blows everything around apart from the noise this seems like an easily fixed design flaw guess i will be sticking with the swiffer for now
this vacuum hardly picks up anything the blower on it blows the dirt away from it so it ca n't pick it up the noise is so loud it hurts your ears
i bought this vac to replace an older dirt devil stick vac that i had for about ten years i really liked the old one and thought i was getting a more powerful version of the it the new one is more powerful alright but all the power is situated in one tiny section of the floor brush if you do n't aim that section right onto what you are trying to pick up forget it ! i agree with some of the other reviewers on the noise level it 's so noisy i feel i should be wearing ear plugs also i ca n't figure out what 's with all the air that blows around while you 're trying to focus on your one little area i think that 's where all the power goes dust debris and hair blow all over the room i 'm going this weekend to buy a new stick vacuum that works maybe i can sell this one in a garage sale my advice to others is do not buy this product ! ! i only rated it with one star because i had no other option
i thought it would cover two burners it covers the big burner and then the edges do n't sit on any heat if i would have looked into it better i would have known this and i would have just bought the square one i was looking for a two burner one for when i was cooking for more than tw
it says this is a 2 burner grill pan but that is so wrong it does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners very dissapointing i love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either hopefully they will come out with an updated one until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues
i just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom however after using it several times i would choose a different grill because of the following reasons 1 the spatter mess there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of 2 there is no option of purchasing a lid 3 the pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter thus somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot
not very easy to fill into the original filter but it saves money though
i wear earplugs at night and i could still hear this humidifier how is that silent
the unit seemed to work well and produced a nice vapor but we bought it for bedroom use and it was just too noisy it produced a high pitched whine which was uncomfortable i could hear it from adjacent rooms we tried it in the tv room where our christmas tree is and it worked better there but it we could still hear it so we returned the unit
i found these nearly worthless for drying dishes they are not absorbent enough i gave these two stars only because you can use them for something besides dishes and because one towel in the set is a thick loose weave that actually absorbs water
very low quality fabric and hard to make look good on the be
i wanted to love this as i bought this on the recommendation of other professional cooks for its zippiness simplicity and sharp blades i am pretty adept in the kitchen but this tool is unsafe if you decide to use the flimsy finger guard also the blades were not sharp enough to handle hard veggies such as carrots gracefully so i was left struggling trying to jam them across the blade the finger guard trying its best to go off track each time the finger guard should be higher and somehow secure better to the track worker 's comp not worth the risk i 'll stick bron
the professional review '' is a this is a horrible piece of kitchen equipment it is a flimsy piece of plastic and a danger to the cook there is no holder for the blades these inevitably float aound your kitchen cupboards and just as inevitably get lost and if you have never scrambled around in a drawer for a metal hedgehog you have still have a treat in store for you the is a travesty it is flat small piece of plastic it can not be attached to the machine so it will get lost too your fingers run very close to the blades when cutting one and you can cut a deep little pocket in your finger the blades are badly designed and catch and tear rather than slice your food they are small easily lost and fall out when you are cutting as i did coulda studded it with garlic and baked it but seeing the bone in my finger turned me off meat for a while sorry folks a description of the taste of long pig will have to wait awhile the blades are attached with a small badly designed screw which you have to tighten hard with your fingers a few mm from the blades same problem when you remove a blade and it has a ridiculously high price you can get better mandolines right here at amazon at a much lower price also much better mandolins at somewhat higher prices take my advice if you do n't cook enough to be very handy with knivies then a mandolin despite finger guards '' and the like are dangerous the mandolin is a lovely thing for the serious cook slicing julliennes etc are a breeze but as with kitchen knives dont get a piece of junk
i was very disappointed with this machine my brand new leaked water from the first day talked to the company 's us service center do n't bother email she will just tell you to call and it is a one person operation service center person said it was probably a gasket and that she would send a replacment but they were on backorder makes you think they are having other problems besides me ! also i found the product manual to be poor why does it take three manuals plus 1 photocopied insert to find the information you need to set up the crema was dark but that may have had more to do with the leakage of water it is a pretty machine but nothing else was pleasing about it update six weeks later the company sent a replacement washer for me to repair the machine with of course i had long since returned it to amazon who quickly credited my card
this toy was destroyed by my 6 month old shepherd pup within the 5 minutes that i turned my back on him caveat this review is about the product not the seller
i love to cook and a good knife will facilitate your cooking experience the first time i used the miracle blade knives i was amazed by how sharp they were but within a month or two the sharpness was not there anymore the guarantee is excellent but there is a shipping charge of about 6 dollars for a new set of 3 knives and there are about 11 knives to replace like i said the knives are great when they are new but the is full of it i dont cut hammers with them and they are still dull
they promise lifetime warranty and in their papers they say you pay 4.95 for shipping but they do n't say it is only for 3 blades plus when you ask for replacment they never replacmen
my sister saw the tv ad and ordered the miracle blade iii set now i knew the said ad and when she told me i was amazed that she once again used tv shopping to buy cheap products who are no good what can one expect for that price it 's just too good to be true so people should use common sense and be suspicious and think about the costs of all these tv ads worldwide they have to calculate that into the price too so one can imagine how much the actual production cost must be no wonder they let them manufacture somewhere in china ! so the set arrived and my sister used it often and was pleased at first i 'll admit the blades are razorsharp be cautious when using them at first but that 's about it after about 4 or 5 months they start to rust and they get dull too logos are falling off and they look terrible the customer support is just plain awful they did n't respond to several emails and when my sister tried to phone them she could n't reach anyone besides the answering machine ! ! ! in the end we did n't even try further to use the so called lifetime warrant '' and diposed the set stay away from miracle blade do yourself a favour and buy a real quality set there are plenty around i wo n't mention a name and for 200 you get a solid set which will really last for a lifetime oh and to other addicted online shoppers please do some research on the net before you pick up that phone and place your order the ads look nice but these are all paid actors like the silly chief tony !
the knives are ok '' could get just as good knives at walmart the warranty service is terrible ! you will be saddened to know that you 'll have to wait upwards of 2 months maybe longer to get your replacement knives i have placed multiple phone calls to the customer service only to state that they have not been shipped yet of course the 5.00 shipping charge was immediately billed to my account i would reccommend as a fellow consumer not to waste your time with these knives spend a few extra dollars and get a much better knife all the meanwhile not having to deal with the guarntee '' you 'll be upset
if you try to wash this product be prepared for a real mess first of all it does feel nice although difficult to cover your comforter this product no matter what you do compresses into a ball and does n't wash well or dry well then trying to unravel this product will take you a really long time very frustrating
i bought this and when i put the batts in it got so hot ! i switched them to duracells and that was better but then it died all together this is my second laser and i think i learned somthing to get a good quality laser it 's got to be an expensive green or super powered blues ! ! the way this is really 0 stars but it 's not an
it broke after one month it was fun while it lasted but i would hesitate in purchasing this if i were you
when i put the batteries in it did not work ! i had to take it apart and solder the spring connection to the pc board

my dog had this ball in tiny plastic pieces in 3 hours he popped the everlasting treat out in just under 10 minutes granted he was not having luck getting the cookie that was inside but would have gotten there by shredding the entire toy if i had n't had to take it away from him
i have a mix but i bought this more for my coonhound who will eat anything anything ! especially if it 's made out of food SMILE i put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest the problem with this toy is that it 's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing the shape is putting them off she later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw but got so little out of it a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward that she lost interest which is saying a lot since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb finally i took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs instand results they are working away at them right now i think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that do n't break into pieces easily if they do at all some dogs love this ! not mine apparently so if anyone wants to try it with their dogs email me i have one never been chewed ! maybe your dog will like it more than mine five bucks !
this takes hours to heat up and the only thing that gets hot is the radiator itself none of the air in my tiny living room was effected
i 've never sent in a review before but after reading the one posted dec 6 in which the writer says that she loves the timer i felt obligated to write another reviewer mentioned that he does n't use the timer having used heaters usually great in the past i was hoping that the solaris with a timer would be the ultimate gentle heater unfortunately the timer is nearly impossible to use it is on the side and the only way to adjust the timer is to lift the whole hot or cold or get down on your hands and knees the timer is 7 '' above the floor because there is no manual override which is unbelievable for occasional use it is necessary to adjust the entire over and over again that 's means pushing up or down 96 fragile little plastic pins the timer is obsolete after closer review of other heaters i believe there are better products out there
this is nothing more than a rectangle of black plush fabric there are no raised edges on it to give the pet a feel of it being a bed '' i really wish they had an image of this before i bought it but hopefully this review will prevent any of you from making the same mistake this would serve ok as a mat inside a pet carrier or dog house and will suit up to a medium size dog it is only 5 but whether or not that is worth it is up to you i reckon a scrap from a fabric store would be just about as sufficient
stayed warm when turned off suddenly stopped working after 4 months even though i hardly ever used it need to buy another electric burner but do n't know what company to go with
although it appears to be a great product for the first couple of months when it 's it 's done ! it simply stopped working after 2 months if you purchase this item be certain you purchase the small appliance replacement warranty from because the manufacturer certainly will not replace it !
at first we loved it then it began to jam when we cleared the pepper it worked for a while and then jammed again early on i had bought six for christmas presents i have n't heard from the recipients i hope their 's work better than mine abercrombi
the design of this knife is horrible ! not all people are as careful as they want to and we know what we will get painful cut ! this brand is not taking people 's security into consideration the corner close to the handle is general really sharp and some items even have a curve that is making it worse i am really unsatisfied that the sharpness of this brand 's collection is good enough while you may get a few stitches on your skin easily
received clock loved the appearance hung it up enjoyed it for about two weeks just long enough for me to discard the packaging then the thing died tried several new batteries jiggling wiggling it just refuses to work any more if you ca n't resist it 's look it is cute hang on to your box and receipt just in case
if i could have given this a zero rating i would have i bought these sheets because they were deep pocket '' sheets they have shrunk and no longer fit my bed
i 'd give it zero stars if i could i read the review from 2005 and hoped that was just one bad batch but it is n't the lid is slightly too large and if used on a pan will damage the surface since it sits on that instead of the lip of the pan so i have returned it note that this is just a problem with the 8 inch lid i also bought the 10 inch lid and that one fits perfectly
i bought this lid to use with my saute pan part of the calphalon commercial cookware set but its slightly too big i would like to point out that if you go to the calphalon web site this is the lid listed as fitting the saute pan the lid is usable but does n't seat well to get any sort of seal on the pan it 's unfortunate as its an attractive well made lid but for my purposes its useless so i am sending it back i also have the stainless steel lid which fits the saute pan perfectly i 'm not sure why calphalon did n't take more care designing this one
unlike the set from last year that was great ! ! these have a cheap feel and a thiner and bendable blade they do not even carry the laguiole name on the blade now not worth the money came in a broken box that was pieces of two or three others that would not fit together a pure wast
buyer beware ! if you are purchasing more than one of these at a time do not buy from home beyond ! despite what their shipping rates say in the description they charge the full shipping rate for each accusharp you order i wanted to get 5 of them and the shipping was almost 30 ! ! ! if you are getting more than one of these at a time order the one called ans accusharp '' shipped from jazebra my shipping charges from them for 5 units was only 7.95 more than making up for the slightly higher price on the sharpener always check your totals in the cart before clicking to finalize your purchase in your cart to be sure
i had just purchased the humidifier and followed all instructions to set up the system after running for 15 seconds the machine 's reset button started to blink which by the way should only be blinking if it runs out of water staring dumfoundadly at a full water resevoir i followed their reset procedure only to have the same thing happen again and again and again when i called customer service they explained that the only time the reset light will come on is if there 's no water left in the resevoir or if there is a mineral build up on the heating element i explained that i had just bought the system less than an hour ago so there 's no chance that there is a build up of any kind and that the tank is full their response was to return it and bring home another system and try that one i am definately returning it but will not be purchasing another bionaire system or anything that has the bionaire name printed on it
otherwise trustworthy bionaire has produced a defective model i 've been through two of them now both with similar problems they tend to shut off despite enough water being in the tank and no other visible problem first one never worked right the second lasted for two months before it continually flashed the reset light customer service could offer no solutions stay away
buyer beware i purchased this tv stand and when i got it home it was cracked and pieces were broken i will never purchase furniture from target agai
we bought this because the picture looked great first of all the instructions are poor and require one to take a piece off before putting another on more importantly one of the holes was missing where the door is supposed to pop in consequently i had to drill it myself next the door is warped and the two doors do not fit together third the back panel does not fit in properly because the the two shelves do not adhere correctly to the slot all in all a very poor constructed item not worth anywhere near the price i will most likely return it even though it is put together it just does not look very good oh another thing it is packed with styrofoam which broke up and got all over our room when i opened the box it took over a half hour to vacuum the crap off of the pieces
