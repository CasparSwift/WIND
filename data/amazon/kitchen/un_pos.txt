i have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she did n't get her way she was becoming intolerable barking at all hours of the night disturbing everyone around she is extremely fragile with a heart condition and i felt a shock collar could kill her i will admit i was very skeptical about this spray collar but i was desperate anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train so i tried the collar and i am very happy to report it works tallys barking has returned to its normal level which was infrequent it happened quickly within a few days we followed the directions on the box which are very important and had good results i ca n't promise this will work for every dog but it worked well for ours without resorting to shocks i do n't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work although i do ocassionaly with tally to refresh her training i feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions and you will get results fairly quickly i am quite satisfied with this product
the premier collar was the best solution to help my dog restrain from barking without any injury to him ! ! he learned within a few days while on walks to stop barking at other dogs when wearing the collar i did n't want to use the shock method but my groomer told me about the premier citronella collar to aid in his training we got good results !
i thought i 'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix i did not want to try a shock collar but i was concerned that this collar would be too large for her she 's only 8 lbs although it looks a little large she does n't appear uncomfortable at all and wow did this work ! the spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark immediately after the first days she is barking less in general and does n't have to wear the collar all that often it 's been 5 days and i do n't think she will need to wear it forever this product has been a total lifesaver and my dog is happy too
this is a great product we have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people kids bikes dogs and pretty much anything we use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car we still use the collar once in awhile we are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach so far we like it a lot
i 've used the itty bitty booklight for years the edition is a welcome improvement it 's much easier to turn and the light stays in place after months of use the light on the original model tends to swivel after time
i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep he likes me to be in the room this was perfect does not put out enough light to bother my son but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep
i own two that include the ac adapter they are great bright lights i used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily replacement bulbs are not hard to find do n't bother paying for high priced zelco bulbs i bought my generic replacements at walmart in the area they sell flashlights i use rechargeable batteries they probably last hours on a fresh charge maybe longer i 've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period i put it on the visor the lights are very bright in some circumstances they might be too bright but that would be a weird complaint for a light huh
this book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person i use it with the converter so i can plug it into the wall but the battery adapter works well for travel i have also used it to read in the car i wish the wiring was a little heavier as this was where my former light failed but it lasted for several years with regular use
i bought this light for my wife several months ago there have been absolutely no problems and it even seems to be holding up better than my original itty bitty book light i would get this one for myself if i decide to get another one but i 'm also checking out the flourescent one which is supposed to never need a new bulb and you can hardly find the bulbs for the regular ones anymore unless you go to zelco 's website
buy this poster if you like spooky things but do n't say you were not warned you are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around this is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books the movie encompasses several of the first books of the series and the poster is indicative of both you will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster i suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks
for those of you unfamiliar with the a series of unfortunate events '' books they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional baudelaire orphans and their struggles to overcome adversity after adversity after adversity ad infinitum hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional brief glimpses of happiness is their distant cousin the scheming greedy conniving ruthless cousin the count given the concept of the story this poster fits perfectly with the orphans standing together but otherwise alone in the middle with the shadow of the count casting gloom upon them it is a perfect fit as is the casting of jim carrey as the count
i bought this bark stop because my neighbor has a pit bull that stays out barking and the shared fence is about 15 feet from my bedroom window the dog barks so loud there is no where in my house that i can retreat to for silence i bought this super bark stop in hopes of quieting the dog the dog is so stupid that it barks even more when the noise starts up so we turned the volume up so that the neighors hear it too that 's what did it as soon as the dog started barking and the alarm sounded the dog was brought in that was until the neighbor broke it with a broom stick so we are buying another one too bad for them
peace at last ! ! ! ! ! we have only had this for 4 days but we are very happy i ordered this because of rude neighbors who leave there 2 dogs who bark and bark and they do n't stop out is a dog run outside our bedroom window other neigbors have complained as well they still wo n't do anything after setting up the bark stop it did n't take long before they got the idea they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing SMILE i called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs trying to bark '' i told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it she thought that was great now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard update okay the real test came last night and again this was the test sirens ! ! ! i just had to laugh they could n't bark and howl ! ! ! all i heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them i am so glad we bought this ! ! ! !
like many people i have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on despite talking to the neighbor politely and such they still have no concern for the noise pollution i was losing sleep and the barking was getting so bad that i even considered moving ! in desperation we looked online for something to stop barking dogs we came across viatek 's super bark stop and decided to risk the money wow talk about being worth the money ! my husband affixed the device on a piece of wood and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard it 's unsightly yes but we 're the only ones to really see it more importantly it 's right in line with the barking mutt the first time he tested it he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin ! we laughed gleefully could a good night 's sleep actually be on the horizon it 's been several days and super bark stop has worked amazingly the dog will lie as far as it can away from the device when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor 's yard if it starts to yelp a little it stops almost immediately it 's as if it 's afraid to bark yay ! you can select the volume tone and number of barks to help eliminate false activation say from talking or loud bird squawking audible and inaudible both work fine but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting the device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 d batteries not included to operate it i am so thankful we found super bark stop ! my nerves were really getting jangled and i was dreading early mornings when they put the mutt outside it 's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are just because you may want a dog does n't mean i want saddled with its noise while you neglect it ! after using bark stop for 2 weeks yes it did work ! we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more not as bad as before though we had it on silent and realized that it had stopped working apparently it 's not 100 waterproof despite the claims of the manufacturer the person i bought it from said that once it 's opened we find that it 's not 100 waterproof '' well guess what you got ta open it to put the batteries in it ! either buy a faux bird house to protect bark stop or house it where it wo n't get wet otherwise you may find yourself in the same position we were in we got a refund and fortunately for us our neighbors got rid of their dog so we did n't bother getting a new one
glad to see they still make this clock yea the parts are simple but i love the way it looks on on my wall i even changed the dots when i moved it used to be on a white wall now it looks even cooler in my new place my own white dots on a glass wall the one i had for years just died i 'm ordering another one hopefully it 'll last as long
i absolutely love this product my neighbor has four little yippers and my mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence i hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking arguments '' with my dog all barking and fighting has ceased all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now
i have a very actiuve border collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything ! i tried all the training methods i could find and nothing worked i then purchased a citronella spray gadget which did nothing i think she liked the perfume i was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices but just in time my nephew lent me his dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog i ca n't recommend it enough
i purchased 3 units and they work well for us i have 2 units in children 's bedrooms on ac power and the in the kitchen on batteries for portability the sound is clear and and use is very easy the best thing about these units is the vox answer option i have this option turned on in the kid 's room and they merely have to answer back when i talk to them first without having to push the talk '' button this is very handy when you are talking to a 3 old that does n't quite understand how to use this i attached a large very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and i keep it on my fridge but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary the only small annoying feature is every time the talk '' button is pressed a beep occurs but the other features outweight that small annoyance for me
purchased to replace our constantly broken intercom system installation is a matter of pushing a button so even i was able to do it and i love the fact that i can carry the station to the washer or outside wherever we also bought the outdoor station and put it at the front now when i 'm outside i do n't have to worry about not hearing the doorbell
i think this is a greater product unlike other intercom systems i 've bought this one is wireless and the sound is clear
i bought this for mother 's day for my mother and mother in law and they both have said that they are still going strong i was a little skeptical at first but they came though oh and for the other reviewer who wrote they are cheaper on is correct but shipping is almost 20 so this is a better deal by far ! i liked this so much i am sending it to someone else
this is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma i am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants it would make a great gift as well
sent to my daughter in ca for her birthday she loves the gardenia the service was excellent thanks to frances emily and
my three year old hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush she gets persistent dandruff and furballs but wo n't let me touch her with any other brush i have tried about every kind of brush but she hates being groomed ! so imagine my surprise when i pull this brush out of the package and she actually lays down for me to groom her after a few strokes ! the only downsides to this product are 1. the small size it does n't hold much fur so either all the fur ends up on the floor or you are emptying it every few strokes 2. the front '' versus back '' positions cats do not generally stay in one place i have three and they roll and walk around while i groom them it was a bit unconvenient to constantly switch the brush from my left to right hand to get the proper angle to my kitties i do n't know how this could be improved but it is a downside to the product overall it 's defineitely worth the 10 bucks i spent my never lets me groom her with anything else
i just received this product today and i already love it i ordered it for my cats it works as great as they said it would
i have a long haired ragdoll cat he is a constant shedder my husband saw this and bought it for me my cat hates being brushed so that is the challenge but when i do it you can see the difference i end up with a pile of fur and a much shinier cat he does n't seem to like it but he will escape for any brushing so i think that 's just him having to go only one direction is a bit hard because the cat is so stubborn but i can see the difference around my house i used to have to clean the furniture daily with a roller and now it is every few days days and no where near the amount of hair that used to get on there ! i recommend this for any long haired animal !
i bought this bookstand at the beginning of after a lengthy search and lots of testing this bookstand is metal and it has a rubber serrated grip to hold the base of a book in a variety of positions for me this is a key feature i use the bookstand at many different locations and i use desks and tables of different heights i adjust the main angle the stand in the back and furtther adjust the book 's angle by wedging the spine into a rubber slot at the base i should note two other benefits first for a year and a half i 've put 1200 page casebooks in this book stand and it 's never bent and i can get the spines of those casebooks to flatten out with the stabilizer arm huge second i can lean into my casebooks and write in the margins this bookstand support my upperbody weight i do n't think you 'll find a plastic stand or a wire stand that will do that in sum if you 're in law school this stand will be your best friend your neck muscles will appreciate the investment
this book stand is an absolute necessity if you 're a college student and even if you 're reading for leisure i love having my hands free to drink a coffee or snack or anything else i want to do
after recently returning to school i was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one 's neck especially while trying to take notes at the same time after looking at several other book stands this seemed to be the best choice i have n't had any trouble with my textbooks both hardcover and softcover even if you 're not experiencing neck pain from reading it 's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself it also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well i 'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well
i first bought one of these at barnes noble or maybe through levenger about 5 years ago lost it traveling and spent hours and hours and hours searching the web going to stores etc looking for another one but it was out of production i bought other book stands in the interim and looked at countless pictures of others but none came close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this little guy tne design is near perfect it folds up so you can flatten it stick it in your book it has little feet that hold the pages of even a realy thick paper back down it 's flat surface balances on just about anything i balance it on a pillow when i 'm reading in bed it adjusts to different angles it 's is a near perfect design i 've given this as a present and the response is always the same how did i ever live withouth this '' if you 're a reader do not hesitate my motive for encouraging you if more people buy them they 'll never go out of production and i wo n't have to worry about losing mine ever again absolutely essential for readers
we have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device we ordered the bark stop pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking we were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we 're very thankful that this device works you have to use the high frequency for the big dogs we would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog
i bought the bark stop about 2 weeks ago i had read several reviews either really good or really bad so i was quite skeptical but my dog jack russell terrier would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house so i was desperate the most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there are n't many things that are both great and easy when you buy treats for dog to train him do you simply leave the treats out all the time no because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to it 's the same thing with the bark stop the first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off i found that doors shutting hard clanging dishes etc all set it off so if the device goes off every 5 seconds the dog is n't going to think for a second that it 's going off because he 's barking he 's going to assume that it 's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with so after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting i decided that i would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage also i never leave the device plugged in when i 'm doing dishes slamming doors or doing loud things so the dog only hears the device when he barks i realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works but i would rather do that than have a barking dog the way i look at it is i would n't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training so why leave it plugged in all the time in the end the first time i plugged in the bark stop i let the dog bark it out he barked for about 5 minutes normally and then stopped the second time i plugged it in he did n't bark more than twice the bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in so i think that now he knows when he 's going to hear more than he wants to i think that the dog has now gotten more used to it and will try to out bark it but for the most part he does n't bark much at all while it 's on if he barks at all the one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house usually this device wo n't help which i think is a good thing cons when i was testing the microphone used for taking in the bark loudness on the device it did n't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low also this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off not to manage each bark but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on or to click it off
very nice and handy product i whish the light was little bit more and brighter
i purchased this center for my son when he was only 3. he has a 13 '' and an original nintendo system with lots of games i thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic easy to put together or move and holds everything i needed it to this item is not something an adult would want to have in living area like one of the reviews i read i mean is a company that makes a lot of products for kids anyway my son loves this product and so does his 2 year old brother
i bought this video center for my son for christmas as well a to store and at first i did not think that it would fit in the drawer part but it did but the games do not fit on the top left and right slots because of the length of the games however they do fit on the sides where you would put the vhs tapes and that is where my son has added his games so you would have to be a little creative with it i had seen a review where a lady had bought this item for her son and she was very disappointed once she could not place the games in the slots and stated not to purchase everyone out there ! do not listen to that its a must have and it does help with organizing your room area ! and the price at the time during the holiday season i could not resist for 71.99 plus free shipping ! wow !
we thought this was very handy storage it holds all our video equiptment just right
this looks like a great organizer but with you people that have a game cube and a dvd player you can buy cd cases that music cds come in and place the xbox and game cube games in those along with the dvds it would be a bit of money depending on how many games and dvds you have
i gave this to my neighbor across the street who said he 'd tried everything on his dog and had decided she was just a barker '' it worked immediately and completely i would only use it in ultrasonic mode because the audible mode will further annoy your neighbors before i found this device i used a hose on a dog who barked under my window at various times of the night during the summer i had to squirt the dog 3 or 4 times for a couple of nights and then the dog shut up dogs should sleep in the house at night
i used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy australian shepherds one of them next door and two more on the other side of it so they were two doors down from me i was skeptical but the dog were driving us nuts i installed a bark free before the super model was released and the dogs quickly learned to shut up it was remarkable they would still bark once or twice if they got but it stopped nearly 100 of their bored i wish someone would let me exercise '' barking i only considered using the ultrasonic mode my only other word of advice is that a competitive product the dog silencer pro is a worthless piece of garbage and even in ultrasonic '' mode it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone including humans avoid that one at all costs
we bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously i confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking he told me if i had a problem with his dog barking to call the police i did ! he tried to have a restraining order put on us so we could n't call the police the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet which he never did so when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic the dogs kennel is about from my garage where i hung it the barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be i have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also apparently they do n't like to hear it ! too bad so sad ! the dog gets used to it so every once in a while i unplug it for a day or so when it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference it has really helped us where the neighbor would n't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking
i had so many barking dogs that i was feeling like shooting them my rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog 's disruption of the neighborhood some kind of power thing i guess when ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill when my last short term renter a pastor yelled no ! at them i became desperate i had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs i was looking for a new collar cironella i plugged in anti bark and then up popped this super bark product i bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree the dogs barked the entire time right at the fence until my daughter turned it on they ran like bats out of hell back to their house and have n't been heard since ! now i was a little sceptical at first but i ca n't praise this product enough you can not get anything else that will do this for you you can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win if you move you might end up with more barking look it 's worth the money believe me ! ! ! !
i turned the device onto human sound because on i did n't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor 's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning the device itself on human sound was triggered by many things air condtioner mower air plane thunder etc which was not good in that i doubt it would serve as an effective training device the dogs seemed to trigger it at random times we have large lots here in this area of nj and i placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem however my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole i placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs ' outside times she advised me that her book clubs inside and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly the capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation i would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone
we have four dogs and they 're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking one of our neighbors strongly suggested '' this product as a possible remedy i did some investigation before purchasing including talking to the manufacturer their sense was that it works for about 50 of dogs which is in line with what i saw in other reviews at the time this was about a year and a half ago anyway because they had a good return policy i went ahead and made the purchase and it worked wonderfully the barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it and in fact we wished we had bought more we have a very big yard that led to our downfall we were moving it around frequently and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch oops needless to say it did n't work after that but remarkably the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months now the grass is green the buds are blooming and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive so it 's time to replace the unit this time i 'm buying two and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer
i was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie the barker and our collie the barker before investing in yet another bark deterrant '' we have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound while also using the reinforcing quiet '' after observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days we are ready to purchase i am sure that it probably wo n't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days ' or in households that are very active but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that wound up '' frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason considering the 50 cost in comparison to some products in the 100 range which quit and had to be immediately to not break training continuity check with a trainer boarder or groomer and test it out first we are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house
i have done a lot of dog training but i have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new i have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do once they got the idea they really enjoyed it i am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled this product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible the teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog 's natural instinct i would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual
this is the greatest ! i had been pricing kits at about 1500 and more this was the answer to my dreams it is good quality simple and is all you need for your dog to learn and have a great time
your product 's name that really describes what the product really does ! it is amazing that the hair magnet really is easy to use and more amazing is the manner in which it preformes gathering pet hair
this is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go it 's not a quick removal tool think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming but for things like wool dhurrie rugs it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things it really does pull up tons of fur even from deep in a rug
as a military spouse we move and have different types of floors that need cleaning i have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home and also in our previous home abroad the vaccum side does not work well at all but i prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how i mop in comparison to sponge and rag mops this leaves the floor pretty dry and the suction is great as long as you empty the tank and keep it clean and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank it works wonderfully it 's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers that generally just push dirt around i believe it 's worth the i 've had mine for two years now
i looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one i chose the for the price which was much lower and for the size this unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around i felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out i have wood floors in the kitchen nook and foyer and i can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over it 's not any faster than mopping but it 's much easier my floors really clean and who would n't love that
product arrived on day promised the cleaner was ordered by my mother who is no longer physically able to keep her bare floors as clean as desired by other methods she tells me that she is very satisfied with the product it cleans the floor to her high standards with a minimum of time and labor
i have really loved this set it looks great cleans easily and i love cooking with it you really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking but once i got used to that i have n't had any problems
after 40 years of marriage i have finally found cookware that lives up to its description i enjoy cooking with these pots they cook evenly and are a breeze to clean the handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling even like the glass lids that allow me to see what 's happening without lifting the lid i just recommended them to my
i purchased this cookware based on very favorable reviews and i 'm happy to say that these pots and pans are great ! both my husband and i enjoy cooking and he 's as happy with this cookware as i am he keeps telling me what a great buy i made ! i really like being able to cook at lower temps and i love the glass lids anyone looking for excellent cookware at a reasonable price should buy this product
bought this item for my daughter and she loves it threw away her old stuff because of this says in makes cooking enjoyable
i was very impressed with this cookware i was a little skecptical about the handles being stainless steel because i thought they would be too hot to the touch while cooking however i have had no problems picking up the pots or pans by the handle while they are still hot this is an exceptional buy for the money
just got these about 3 weeks ago they cook very well and i really like the see though lids the only thing i consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the rivet '' that was used to secure the handle to the pan kind of a pain to keep that area clean overall very satisfied with the pans
wonderful set also got the stockpot with this free so very slickdeal SMILE great nonstick coating but you really must hand wash but that is ok ! !
good combination i keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have no worry about changing batteries
accessory for the led version of zelco 's excellent itty bitty booklight '' assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days
this will be the third thumper i 've bought lost the first one on a trip second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift it 's simple to use loud enough to wake you and does n't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes the thumper pad is big enough to hit when you 're groggy ! more products should be as easy to live with as this one !
having problems hanging your family photos this is the perfect product and inexpensive sooooooo easy
these are great i hung a heavy picture using one of these hooks and it is still hanging it was very easy to use
they really do work as advertised they go right into drywall be careful not to hit a stud however ! with no muss and no fuss i have n't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds but for basic home picture hanging etc they really do work as advertised
works as advertised can not be used if wall stud is directly behind use point at roughly 1 per hook a hammer and nail makes more sense
these hercules hooks are absolutely incredible i wish i had them before my husband put many many holes in our walls with anchors and screws if i want to relocate anything he tries to patch up the hole but it always shows these hooks make only a pin sized hole ! i hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it it is still there incredible product and well worth the price
this is a excellent as described very easy to incert and position have n't checked the weight not disappointed
these hooks are incredible ! ! i have used them throughout my home to hang heavy art work and mirrors and the best part is that i can do it myself without waiting for my husband to get out his drill hammer leveler etc i love them so much we have given them as house warming gifts and everyone that has received them from us has been as amazed as we are by how effective and easy they are to use ! if you want a secure and quick way to hang anything on your walls without making a huge hole use these hooks !
i am very pleased with this fryer it heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods unlike most consumer grade fryers this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries other fryers 'choke ' lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together not with this baby i used a coupon got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister this was a great deal
bought ours two years ago after considerable research busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout not one problem yet best one on the market as far as i am concerned
this is a well thought out product for consumer use easy to clean easy to use tried others and was very disappointed but i 'm extremely pleased with this one some advice stay away from the
i purchased this deep fryer after doing considerable research i wanted one with a good capacity and that would be reliable it has surpassed my expectations we have been using it for over a month the initial use was to fry chicken tenders for a large party 15 lbs of chicken tenders were fried in no time with very little oil useage since that time we have fried okra french fries tater tots onion petals cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream all have turned out very well it holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil this heats up in about 10 minutes there is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature this produces crisp foods with no oily taste and very little oil useage it has a breakaway magnetic cord to keep it from accidently being pulled off of the counter it cleans up as easily as can be expected i just put the basket and the oil resevoir in the dishwasher the food can be lowered into the oil with the lid in place this keeps oil spatters to a bare minimum i have been very happy with my purchase so have the hoards of teenagers that gather at my house there has even been one instance when they brought the food and did their own frying although frying is not the most healthy way to prepare food at least with this deep fryer it is easy quick tasty nearly and about as grease free as possible while this one costs a bit more than others on the market i certainly feel as though i am getting my money 's worth
i 've always wanted a deep fryer and finally decided to take the plunge after doing quite a bit of research i decided on this model picked one up at bed bath and beyond with a 20 coupon in my opinion you generally get what you pay for so the extra cost competitors was n't a real concern i must say overall i am quite pleased while i am new to frying i found it extraordinarily easy it is pretty hot though so be careful only complaint would be that the capacity is a little on the small side say if you 're cooking entrees for a larger family for example you can really only fit 3 maybe 4 pieces of chicken at a time but since the chicken needs to cool down anyway this was n't such a major issue it came out nice crispy and golden brown not too soggy not too crisp perfect i figure if it can handle the chicken vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake although i 've only fried a couple of batches i am beyond pleased but i 'll let you know if i have any problems great item so far though
easy to use easy to clean two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy this thing is easier to clean than my old george foreman grill and that to me was a pain in the neck the only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil which i do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much i 've used it and what i 've cooked if i 'm doing just veggies i keep the oil if i do a meat or seafood i 'll change the oil right after very pleased overall
i purchased this for my wife a hundred bucks for a knife insane ! until you use it i think this is worth the money my wife says is the best thing since sliced bread and you can slice bread with it seriously great knife it will last a long time do n't keep buy cheapo knives year after year just get one of these very sharp edge nice weight and comfortable
after working with a combination of german knives for more than ten years i decided to buy a global knife and give it a shot it feels great in my hand and is easy to handle and work with the blade is incredibly sharp and has held its edge very well all in all i liked this knife so much that i decided i wanted more of them and bought the set i ca n't give it a much better endorsement than that
i bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable as a vegetarian i use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless money very well spent as i know it 'll last a lifetime
i originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant i work at had one i picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind a couple weeks later i bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener i have no idea what that other guy must be doing to his knife but my blade sharpens very easily and stays sharp for months as long as you do n't abuse it by far my favorite knife that i have used one warning though if you are going to do a large amount of chopping like say you 're a prep cook or you make dinners twice a month then the angled shape of the back of the blade may rub the side of your index finger the wrong way i cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday and have only been irritated by the shape a few times under heavy chopping regimes but it is something to consider overall i could n't love this knife more it 's the most important kitchen tool i have ever owned
i 've been a german knife snob for years but this chef 's knife by japan 's global is the finest blade i 've ever owned period maybe it 's not as easy to sharpen as a wustof or a henckel but then again it holds its edge ten times longer i 've spent ten years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds ! of dollars collecting german steel global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again
i baught my 8 '' global chef 's knife about 5 years ago it has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market the steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its counterparts my only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style nor my large hands i do n't mind the steel handles although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip my main problem is with the tapered bolster which is almost a lack of bolster altogether coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand i highly recommend globals but i might suggest the 8 '' heavyweight model which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the bolster for more info on knife handling and care you might check out the cia 's book titled the professional chef 's knife kit '' and one last comment although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe please please do n't put your knives in the dishwasher
i desperately needed a new knife because my old chicago cutlery wooden handle knife became a gross and nasty coli distributing piece of junk which was very sad because i loved that knife ! i had it for years i ended up buying this knife because i really liked the look of the handle it looked like it would grip well and it does to me it seemed a bit expensive but the stainless chicago cutlery knives handles were very smooth so there were few choices for me the most important point is what ever brand you choose go with handles do n't make the mistake that i made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick
we have sabatier and wusthof sets but this is the first knife that every one of the family goes for first perfect balance easy to sharpen cuts meat juliennes perfectly even slices tomatoes pair this with the global paring knife and really that 's all you need although my wife now wants her own for christmas clearly she 's an incurable romantic
i have a number of booklites different vendors different styles some ac adapter some straight battery cheap to higher prices and this one is the best the brightest the one i will most often use it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times i am careful with such items do n't expect any problems most booklites are not meant to be manhandled
i have looked over this product it is a birthday present for someone else so i have n't actually used it and find that it meets all my expectatons for size light weight design
very well made reading light nice carrying case decent battery consumption fits most of the books really well happy reading
i have tried a number of different booklights and they all go through batteries in about 5 minutes this light can be purchased with an ac adapter eliminating the need to constantly replace batteries it is bright enough to clearly illuminate the pages of your book stays where it 's clipped and reasonably adjustable i love it
i love this light ! i spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book disturbing my husband it 's also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs like most other reading lights couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance
i bought this breadmaker because i wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf it makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and i recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen ! i have not bought a loaf of bread since i 've owned this fine bread making machine
i 've been using my zojirushi for over two years now and make at least a couple loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread a week along with fancier breads using the dough function i love the fact that there are two paddles to knead the bread this works so much better than my machine of 10 years ago with just one paddle which often left gobs of unkneaded incredients i also really like the horizontal full loaf pan you can make normal sandwich loaves with this design the one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting rising and baking times individually sometimes i want the dough to rise longer than the preset times but there 's no way of overriding it oh well guess nothing is perfect i highly recommend this product
i have had 4 different bread machines all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style i did n't mind the bread they turned out but i did n't like the loaf shape my prayers have been answered ! i ca n't quit making bread now ! the loaves come out perfect and if they do n't i have come to relize that with bread it is typically the cook 's error not the machine 's you need to really read the directions which i find most people do n't if you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it i 've made all kinds of sweet sourdough french italian herb and cheese fruit and beer breads in the machine name it and they all come out just fine if not i tweak the recipe i do n't blame the machine all in all an excellent product this is my favorite bread machine so far the only down side is the sourdough setting do n't be fooled the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar for true sourdough you have to wait the days but if you ca n't wait oh and the big viewing window '' unless someone installs a light inside the machine you ca n't really see what 's going on anyway after my first 50 loaves i will let you know how it 's holding up
i own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year i bake per week the machine makes excellent bread dough i have n't bought a loaf of bread since i bought this machine when i want a more crusty bread make pizza or make a foccacia i use the dough cycle with amazing results highly reccomend this product it takes a little practice if you never used a bread machine before read instuctions carefully measure ingredients if your bread is slopsided watch for drafts most of my breads come out looking picture perfect the taste you ca n't compare it with store bought bread plus no preservatives or additives of any kind
i bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and i use it every day the white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time i 've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs i tried one wheat bread loaf it was very tasty but not quite the consistency that i like so i need to play around with that one alittle bit i 've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before but now that my kids are grown up i now have some time to work in the kitchen i highly recommend this machine
i had several bread machines before my zojirushi and they baked ok but with my zojirushi is just amazing i bake the most delicious and gorgeous breads cakes and jams throw away all your bread machines and get the one zojirushi also try other products from zojirushi i have the rice machine and the eletric skillet and the are great
i have been using six second abs for a month i can see my stomach getting flatter so i wouldnt believe the commericals that say it took them a week to get a six pack but if you want a flatter stomach then this will help overtime
contrary to the opinion expressed in the previous review i found the resistance levels more than adequate it might be that it was being used incorrectly by using the back and arms rather than pulling from the abs i developed very good ab definition after around 2 months working out at 120 crunches on my back 3 only problem was the machine broke when it was n't even on the highest setting but i intend buying another
we use these more than any other dishware items in our pantry they go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven plus they are indestructable whether dropped banged in the dishwasher or otherwise abused they are pretty small however u can fit a can of corn or heat up a chicken breast or two in the microwave but not much more fits into it we have 8 for a family of 4 and we could use a couple more if we had the space so buy extras
i only bought 2 and now wish i 'd purchased 8. they are heavy and appear very durable the lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal actually much better than expected wait for them to reappear on the friday sale and save a couple of bucks i assure you you wo n't be disappointed
it is the perfect size for a bowl to eat out of it has a lid so it is good for leftovers or taking to work and having a handle is great there are no worries about taking a hot dish out of the microwave you just grab the handle and eat probably ideal for teens or college kids also they also hold up well we have a couple that are about 10 years old and recently bought some more on amazon
i love the ! they are wonderful i was so disappointed when the outlet store i used to buy them from told me that they no longer make these so i am thrilled that i was still able to find these online and with the lids ! ! ! thank you so much !
i 've got one of these floating around my house without the lid with the other common '' shared and i have to say everyone loves this one i think it 's great of the handle more than anything else college students like handles on their dishes
i bought this to use for brown bagging '' but have used it for so much more this little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks all without having to change the contents to a dressier '' dish french white is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money
i love these dishes i bought these because i need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white they mix with the set beautifully ! i like the feel of the classic wedgewood bone china so i 'm glad they priced this set so i can afford to use them for everyday dishes the packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes but surprising everything made to me in one piece so i 'm very happy with my purchase
i love all my calphalon pots pans and bakeware best set i have every owned or used even heat easy clean up i have never made reductions as easily as i have in these pots pans the fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top i paid 24.99 for this when i bought a few other pieces got free shipping 25.00 off the order
it works great and i like being able to use metal spoons it apears to be of great quality
very pleased with the quality of this pan good weight and cooks food evenly clean up is easy too good product
loved this pan i got several others too price was much below average
i am so over nonstick even calphalons i have been gradually replacing all my nonstick with uncoated cookware this saucepan really rocks i use it all the time i do n't have to worry about scratching it and i really have n't had much trouble with clean up
i purchased this pot in january and have used it several times a week since i love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review the pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well and i looked forward to years of use until i boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles the noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking scrubbing cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot i will definatly be purchasing another pot overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch i would totally reccomend it just do n't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes
i like the size and shape of this saucepan it is big enough for something like spaghetti sauce or even mashed potatoes but not so big is overwhelms smaller jobs cleans up nice and the lid is good
really have enjoyed using this saucepan cooks evenly does not stick cleans up good thinking of purchasing more of this product
the money tree arrived today on time it was a gift to me SMILE i opened the box and could n't believe how perfect this tree was i 'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon especially for the holidays the roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree thanks
i have ten dogs and eleven cats plus i volunteer at a local rescue group and i always keep a couple of bottles in my medicine chest two of my dogs use it all the time a golden retriever with allergies and a cocker spaniel with chronic ear infections due to severe neglect in his previous life zymox with hydrocortisone has an enzyme that promotes natural healing plus the hydrocortisone takes the itch away so they do n't scratch themselves raw thus the infection i also use it on the ocassional yeast or bacterial infection you do n't even have to guess what kind because it works for both twice a day for a couple of weeks takes care of it without having to pay a vet 's examination fee
my dog had ear problems for years and finally came across this product cleared it up in one week with only a couple of applications i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with chronic ear problems
my chihuahua has had chronic ear problems since he was a little puppy i 'm not a fan of the antibiotic ointments that vets prescribe because they contain medication he does n't need for his yeast problems i 've tried all sorts of natural ear cleansers to no avail i found this product highly recommended by an online vet site so i thought i 'd give it a shot within 2 days his ears looked perfect no scratching or shaking either it 's been 3 weeks since i last put in the drops and i have n't had to worry about them since i honestly ca n't believe how well this solution works i 'm so happy my little guy is n't feeling miserable with his ears anymore
used vet 's rx to treat my dog 's ear and it didnt seem to work after reading reviews i decided to try this after only 1 week i noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better would recommend to others
my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments all costing a fortune we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear this stuff is great and at the price of prescription and no vet charges i 'm happy to keep it on hand
my beagles have chronic ear infections and i was spending hundreds of dollars per year to keep them in check doctor visits in order to get the prescribed and expensive zymox otic has solved the problem keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when i started it be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection
irecently purchased a bottle of zymox with hydrocortisone for my lab who has had several really bad ear infections i was spending a fortune at the vets searched the web until i read about this decided to give it a sooooo glad i works ! her ears are clear she is happy will keep buying this you zymox
this product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments i had received there zymox takes about a week to work with one or two treatments a day it has had the same effect for my sister 's dog who had had recurrent ear infections i have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success
my 10 yr old cocker spaniel has had cronic ear infections for 4 yrs she has developed a resistance towards most antibiotics and steroids and all antibiotics make her stomach sour some antibiotics even make her ears worse ! nothing works completely but zymox seems to give her a reasonable comfort zone without zymox expensive total ear canal ablation surgery would be her only option after expensive tplo surgery and 4 years of ear infections my finances have been exhausted zymox has given me better results than the vet saves 150 a month vs the vet and is well worth the daily ear cleaning and drops
i read about zymox on a vet 's website regarding chronic ear infections my black lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when i found her the usual story of rounds of antibiotics including expensive baytril without resolution of her problem it 's been almost a month now and her ears are improving i find that i can not skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs but if done daily she has little goo i plan on continuing every day and i hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics
this is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver i am purchasing another one because it 's working so well i am a professional dog trainer and all i can say is that the product is great but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed as a professional dog trainer i still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers our toy poodle was essentially when i was home but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out she ended up peeing in front of the door because nobody was letting her out so i got the lentek door chime and taught my dog to use it and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear we also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in everybody is happy now i 'm getting another pad for upstairs because we still have oblivious teens and hubby so great product but be sure that you have parts of the product and give a good trainer a call to help you get started
it takes a little patience to get the dog to use it at first she thought is was a treat machine but eventually she realized it meant go outside works very well
easy to use our dog learned how to use it reliably in a couple of days no directions came with it we called our trainer and asked how to do it
i hung 2 big jingle bells on a sturdy ribbon by the door it accomplishes the same thing with no batteries to worry about ! consistantly ring the bell before opening the door and he 'll learn in 2 or 3 days
we love our pet chime it took a little time to train our dog on it but now it 's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out it 's also a great conversation piece when company is over we 've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and have n't had any problems we 're getting an extra paw
it 's hard to find anything wrong with such a damn good juicer that i only paid 25 for what can beat that money very well spent it does spray a little depending on what you 're putting in but again what juicer does n't i can live with this for 25 ! wear an apron duh it does say in the manual that it does n't do wheatgrass i missed that bit but no biggie ! i can cope for only carrots beets celery cabbage ginger cucumber peppers apples pears etc all hard veg and fruit are just perfect it does these really well i adore oranges done in this juicer with all the pith on they come out so creamy ! not acidic like regular oj i 'm still hooked got my juicer a few weeks back and i 'm still using it daily it 's awesome
i 'd been looking for a good juicer for a number of months but had shied away because they 're expensive i saw this deal read and analyzed the reviews and rolled the dice it arrived yesterday and after easily disassembling it to wash the parts and get to know it initially i ran a half dozen carrots through it omg ! ! fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen ! was easy well i was an old pro by now and quick under five minutes to address some of the negatives you may read first size of course it 's big they 're all big and bulky it 's their nature second residue my carrot pulp was dry i suppose if i 'd put it on the floor and stood on it i might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it third it 's factory reconditioned for me that 's a plus consider this the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line each one and polished by qc before bagging and boxing assuming that they are all good to go but a factory is gone over from top to bottem inside and out before it 's released no assumptions the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again so you know they 'll make sure they do n't and if it 'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem i can certainly live with that considering the discount i 'm getting i 'm still not sure why they 're virtually giving these away but waring is an old and trusted brand and the juicer is not cheaply made i 'll be back in a year hopefully not sooner to give some time perspective to this review as soon as i finish writing this i 'm ordering two more as christmas gifts
though i have not tried the juicer yet but i could not pass off the price
i am very happy with it inexpensive easy to clean and highly recommend
i 've wanted a juicer for a long time but could never really justify the expense knowing that i 'd very likely quickly tire of the maintenance involved when i saw this juicer for under 25 it seemed like the perfect opportunity when i opened the box i was immediately impressed with the unit 's solid construction you can see right away that this is n't a plastic piece of junk that 's going to break righ away with the unit 's first use i juiced cabbage kale spinach carrots onions and peppers the unit while not as powerful as more expensive models i 'm sure juiced up everything with no hesitation i would describe the pulp to be damp but not what i 'd call really wet i dreaded the juicer process that i 'd heard so much about disassembly of the unit is a breeze there are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of no problem if there 's one thing i could change it would be a better designed that would allow a bag to be used this is only a minor gripe and has in no way made me regret the purchase if you are a casual juicer looking to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money this would be a perfect choice i 'm still amazed that i got this for under 25 and i 'd recommend it without hesitation
i 'm absolutely thilled with this waring ! it 's definitely changed my opinion of juicers i purchased the reconditioned model it arrived factory re and looked brand new not a single mark on it not even a fingerprint ! it 's far easier to clean obviously by superior design the parts clean up like new in the dishwasher the components fit perfectly despite probably a couple hundred uses it 's exponentially faster and the remainders are noticeably dryer as another reviewer mentioned this refuse obviously indicates a very efficient juicer ! looks sounds and functions like a very upscale appliance no spraying no movement no juicer drama '' ! SMILE absolutely the best one i 've owned and after lots of uses it 's still going as strong as it did when it arrived
i received my reconditioned waring juice extractor today so far so good i 've wanted to have a juicer for a long time but was discouraged becasue of the prices this unit sells refubed for 30 here on ebay for that price i had to order assembly takes about 30 seconds i sliced up an apple and tossed in some celery and a pear the motor sounds very powerful and went through everything i tossed in there quite quickly wow very good i can see this is going to cost a lot in fresh fruits and veggies now i would n't say mine is completely splash free but only a few tiny drops at most escaped the that was left behind was moist but not dripping wet i 'd give it an 87 for extraction clean up was easy there are basically 6 parts to this thing the metal cup the spinning bit the catching part the lid the plundger and the unit they all come apart for easy cleaning the spinning bit 's screen gets gunk clogging the holes but that cleans easily with a sponge and the included brush the catch pludger and lid are plastic and can go in the upper part of the dish washer or you can do it by hand in about a minute great deal thus far
this juicer is fantastic i could n't believe how inexpensive it was and was actually rather apprehensive when it arrived i plugged it in and juiced half of my fridge it was so good that i just juiced the other half
this food coloring was the best i have ever used it is very concentrated i obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time i did not notice a flavor at all so i look forward to trying the black the bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish
i bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing the ateco food coloring gave nice bright vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well i was totally satisfied with the purchase
these are easy to use they do not make a mess and offer vibrant colors they do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can i would highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate
i purchased 2 of these cages and my first comment is that the picture of the cage is just what you are getting it is hard to find a large cage for parakeets with the correct bar spacing so no one slips out this cage was the answer for all of our needs not only is the bar spacing great for our paratkeets but there is lots of room the stand that the cage sits on is very sturdy and does not wobble like a lot of cages that come with seperate stands assembly is also easy the only time i had to pull out a tool was to put the stand together and that was very easy to do if you are using this cage for parakeets you should use twisty ties to secure the doors even more parakeets love to lift the doors up and down and it is a matter of time before they realize they can also get out the cage is also very nice for our parakeets because it has different levels that the birds love to explore great cag
i was so thrilled when i unpacked my processor it is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance it has so many features that i love especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time the egg beater attachment is excellent also i am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all
the best salsa the best pesto and salad dressings made with this food processor we all should have one
this is a terrific machine amazon 's price beat everyone especially with their 20 promotional discount no sales tax and no shipping charges the oversized feed tube makes preparation much simpler as i do n't have to try to fit '' my ingredients into a narrow tube is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any it 's quiet and efficient i only wish that there were more outlets hear me amazon that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level overall i am highly satisfied and happy i spent a little more and got the best
this is our first food processor did a lot of looking before making this purchase it 's easy to use and clean made salsa with our garden fresh tomatoes the day it arrived makes slicing a breeze great price from amazon ! no complaints of any kind
this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed
this is the best kitchen appliance we own my wife has saved more time with this appliance very strong motor nice look our garden is all choppped up
very happy with the proformance of the the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done pizza still needs to be worked on fantastic product
i loved this item until it became fused to the base i called cs and they sent me a prepaid ups label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a 50 off coupon to keep using kitchenaid very impressive

showed up on time with a cold pack wraped in a box and a phone number to contact and the person who inspected it very nicely done
i surprised a friend with these flowers they arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses to bad that they are not shipping in romania update after 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice i am so glad that i could make someone happy with these very nice roses
the flowers not only arrived in good time they were also so lovely my friend who loves roses was very impressed definitely a great purchase
i was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my itty bitty book light at such a reasonable price fast shipping too
i bought this device one week ago and i like it a lot it counts steps pretty accurately i measured it three time and i got the following results and the first number is what it showed the second what i walked basically accuracy at 1 or better which is exceptional for this price i use the least sensitive setting the backlight is very nice and by tilting the device a bit more one can see the display clearly at night the clamshell design is also nice and practical avoiding pressing buttons accidentaly and resetting for example a day 's steps now do not buy this device for the fm radio the reception is pretty poor and the quality of sound when you get a signal is what you would expect from a device costing as much as this plus i guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function i do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more in conclusion this device has a good price for what it gives although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy but definately do not seem as sturdy personally i like this device a lot and i highly recommend it pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries
i bought one of these for my girlfriend then read the reviews ! in my opinion it appears to work fairly well the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage to the far left seems to work best for 'normal ' walking as i said in terms of accuracy i think it 's pretty good the radio portion of the unit is reason for the out of 5 ' stars the sound is tinny '' it 's not stereo there 's no frequency disply and the ' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones earbuds because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size ! though overall when comparing price to features this little fella will probably suit your needs if you already have a walkman or do n't care about audio the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet
excellent pedometer for the money worthwhile investment i only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity and now it works great radio works great definately reccommend
this pedometer is great it 's very small and very light i forget it 's even there it keeps me motivated to walk more and the radio is wonderful for walks around the neighborhood i have dropped it a couple of times but it has not damaged the pedometer at all it 's a great product and i definitely recommend it
i was amazed at how much i am enjoying my flavia fusion i saw it at a boat show and tried some my husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday i really love it i love the decaf house blend it is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it the flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee i also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well i like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks it surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research before buying it it is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee the flavia is a luxury item not for a poor working stiff anyway the flavia is fast and simple and convenient in fact i 'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now enjoy it
i absolutely love this machine ! the selection of coffees and teas is wonderful i am a tea drinker primarily engish breakfast and chai latte and i am quite picky about the quality with some of the pod brewers i have tried the tea has been quite weak however with the flavia the engish breakfast tea is very good the chai is excellent as well the chai latte is very smooth and does n't have the peppery taste that some can have pros 1. great tasting coffees and teas 2. great selection 3. virtually no clean up 4. you can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea does n't taste like coffee very important cons 1. you better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen this will only happen once trust me because you will not want this to happen again 2. you can only purchase coffees and teas through their website hopefully as this machine becomes more popular there will be more options for purchasing
what a quick easy way to make a great cup of coffee i like to mix the packs up and make my own brew i have freinds that love the machine and went and bought them one this is the best coffee machine we have ever i like is i can mix the diffrent packs and make my own brew that you cant get in a coffee shop or at the store hint get the vanilla syrup pack and add it in the mix
we have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee at long last it has arrived in the form of the flavia fusion ! this is the easiest quickest most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make the unit does have a large footprint but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger set up is simple remove from box insert the filter fill it with water and plug it in thats it once you prime '' the system pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch you 're ready to go insert the beverage packet adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel push the button and voila ! since the water is preheated you get a hot delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds if you get the medley '' pack value 29.99 you also get a free travel mug contrary so what some reviewers have said it does fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray the medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you do n't like it the creamy topping '' is a must have for any special indulgence '' drinks you want a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like starbucks which it does this is a fantastic time saver in the morning and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person as for clean up there are two '' what cleanup '' you take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage simple as that no more filters to buy no more pots to descale no more throwing out half of the pot that you did n't drink just amazing
this machine is wonderful ! i first tried flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the mercedes dealership best coffee i 'd had in a long time it 's so nice to walk into the kitchen insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot whatever i feel like ! this machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets whether they are teas coffee or chocolate i would recommend this to anyone
i love this machine each package is its own brewing system that means that there is nothing to clean nothing to clog and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other i love strong coffee and i found even the house brand to be full flavored most surprising is how good the teas taste you actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea the herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor the only disappointment was the hot chocolate it was basically just as good as swiss miss the frothing packages do work but i get just as good if not better from skim milk and a 2 gizmo from ikea they are nice to keep on hand the milky way froth does give a nice caramel flavor the big down side is you can only get refills from flavia they have recently started giving free shipping on orders over 100 so stock up and get the free shipping my big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir i have accidentially run out of water more than once the machine does 'spit ' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup
granted it is a bit noisy at first more like a shocking sound not so much noisy but you get used to it the mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill especially if you 've never used any of the larger office machines this was a complete first for me i mixed a few watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes but i got the hang of it and love it i commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at 2 to 3 a cup so there 's a huge savings in this product and the tea is the best i 've ever had they actually add juice concentrates in the pack some selections so the tea is very flavorable the machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter but i think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home it will always stick out at first i bought black and it looks great there really is n't any cleanup at all other machines i looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons this really is so simple finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter because the packs are bigger than most pods it is a challenge i ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry the round display rack that flavia offers looks pretty neat i will definately buy that over all it 's a perfect product in my opinion
only problem i have with it is that the plug does n't go all the way into the power which seems a little bit unsafe but works grea
it was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than do n't fit although the bottom feet which you do have to assemble had to be forced in order to fit it 's also quite attractive i should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is it 's nice to see real wood but i am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff ikea sells is more environmentally friendly finally you ca n't beat the price
this is functional yet very nice to look at and is extremely easy to put together it holds alot of dvd 's or cd 's and looks nice with any deco
this is my third mission collection item and it lives up to the other two you ca n't go wrong with this collection i use it for picture frames on a small wall that seemed too empty it took nothing to assemble and is great looking ! highly recommended
we have one like a couple other reviewers here in the dark color we 've had it for probably a couple of years we love it ! with our dvd collection we went back to target to get another one and now all they have is natural ca n't seem to find the dark wood one anywhere online either can anyone help ! ps i checked ebay too with no luck i 'm guessing nobody 's selling theirs because they love it so much
i have one in a dark color i ca n't find anymore anywhere anyone know if they stopped making the other color
i think this item is a great buy well designed and very functional although i use it for my dvd 's instead of cd 's however my dvd collection has extended beyond the capacity for one tower so i 'm seeking to buy another but i wanted another dark walnut tower since the rest of my book shelves and my dvd tower i 've gotten from amazon are also in this color is there any way of finding this item in dark walnut
the hoover is my first steam cleaner it got my carpets cleaner than the model i rented from giant and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years i did have problems when i tried to use the attachments water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected might be user error i will have to look for better instructions
works very well you 'll probably want to the carpet and also boil the water to get it extra hot if the hot water out of your tap is n't that hot once you do that it works extrememly well
i have a 9 ' x 12 ' area rug in my living room from pottery barn with 2 cats a dog and a old daughter vacuuming was just not enough this carpet was also beginning to smell like my dog after a big rain yuk ! my husband was convinced that we should throw this carpet away boy do i wish i took before and after pictures ! immediately after the first swipe i saw something magical there was my beautiful carpet again ! aside from working wonderfully it was easy to assemble and use of course i would have loved a bigger water tank i changed the water once on my ' carpet but that 's really fine also be sure to read the instructions an area rug like mine should have plastic placed underneath of it to protect the hardwood floor while shampooing i just took a few garbage bags cut them and opened them up and it was also a great deal sears had similar models for 100 more next i will buy the hardwood floor cleaner and scrub my floors with it
after having read the positive comments i purchased the from amazon and it was delivered this week i tried it today and i 'm very pleased with the results even though my den just needed to be refreshed '' i was amazed to see how dirty the water was i had brought home a bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the amazon comments were very negative so i returned it the only negative comment would be that the writeup in amazon is not correct there was no bare floor attachment in the box i had to order one from the hoover store but that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine
i have really messy children at the begining i thought about renting a carpet cleaner cause my carpets became very dirty i thought that nothing will clean them exept a commercial carpet cleaner but when i decided to start poty training them i found that i have to own one at home it 's really great it cleaned my carpets it 's easy to use it 's light i use it all the time for the usual old accidents the new potty ones
i rented the rug doctor to clean my area rugs on memorial day weekend and by july weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years i think it was due to the soap although i rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after i used the rug doctor soap i was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because i was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again this machine is easy to use i had absolutely no problems with leaking i did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet i used two scoops of oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses no problems whatsover my carpets got so very clean it extracts very well also my rugs dried fast i am so happy that i purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at amazon
my carpets feel and look brand new after using the steamvac ! i love how soft it feels so i have been using the steamvac at least every weeks the suction is great and my carpets dry super fast i agree with the other reviews not to use more than half of the solution that is called for
after years of renting rug doctors we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner we were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our carpets when they come in from playing also one of them is a puppy who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times after reading other reviews we selected the hoover we wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner the carpets are as clean as with a bigger rug doctor we have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time we are very happy with our hoover it is fairly light easy to fill and empty and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes as other people have commented the attachment hose tends to fall off so we just leave it off otherwise it 's a heck of a deal !
since we heard nothing but bad things about hiring carpet cleaning services we researched this steamvac to replace that our carpet had a lot of cat stains and had n't been shampooed in two years this thing was amazing ! it took out all the stains and a ton of cat hair and dirt we continue to use it for spot cleaning cat yes she does it a lot ! and it is easy to use and clean up very happy with our purchase and now we can steam clean whenever we want without worrying about hiring someone to come into our house
this bookcase was fast and easy to set up and it fits perfectly in the small space i have for it the one thing i would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves but that 's not a problem if you actually put books on this bookcase
i love this bookcase my only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split a bit but it still fit together so i kept it excuse the rhymes please it 's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books including some big heavy hardcovers 20 dvds 3 dvd box sets 12 videotapes and a few pictures and knicknacks and yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom best part the ease with which you can put it together i have ms so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal highly recommended
this mission folding bookcase is simply the best although i wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about 5 minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed
my husband and i purchased this shelf as a place to put my rather large collection of cookbooks we received the shelf within days of placing our order upon opening it took me maybe minutes to take it from completely packaged to set up we liked it so much after a month we purchased a second one we had the same positive experience with the second one the shelf is attractive as well as sturdy and affordable !
the product came in a timely manner it was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly i 'm glad i purchased it
it was great and easy to install enough shelves for my stuffs well it met my expectation
i have bought 2 of these bookcases they are very well made set up in 2 minutes forget the pressed wood bookcases i have they sag and fall apart not these bookcases they are solid wood the real thing and best of all there is no assembly required just unfold where you want it and start filling it up ! also very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again excellent buy for the price not made in china i think it is made in vietnam
i bought 3 of these they are a great addition to my natural pc table and 2 bookcases that i already had the price is great too
i have had this product for over a year and the bulb just burned out no cord problems ever i use it every night in bed and it does not disturb my husband i have never had any problem with it it looks like from the other reviews that maybe i just got lucky or it 's just that i have taken good care of it and never dropped it ! if i dropped it i would expect that it would break i would highly recommend this product
i am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product i purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and ac adapter about 5 years ago and i am still using it i replaced the light bulb for the first time replacement comes in the set i bought last year when it started flickering and died the book light has been used a great deal and i have accidently left it on for full nights before i am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage this is the only down side i can think of the battery pack has its advantages you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive i prefer using the ac adapter this might be why i never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time it fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks you can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want over the last year my boyfriend has bought at least 3 led booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them he has been stealing my booklight to read with and i am force to use the poor night stand lighting the funny thing is i had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a led book light now i am on this page again to buy another one for myself
i have owned one of these little wonders for over five years during that time i have replaced the lightbulb one time which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required for people who are complaining that the light feels flimsy '' have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light it 's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose imagine that ! it 's a moving part ! seriously maybe they 've switched to a different supplier although i doubt it but my light is a joy it has proven durable over countless trips moves and drops it provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you plus unlike so many designs on the market it is very lightweight some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read i just do n't understand all the negative reviews of this product the only thing i can suggest is try tightening those screws periodically it will make a world of difference
i purchased one of these for my elderly mother it is very easy to use and works just as advertised ! the only problem we have had with it so far is once when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim i would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener
got tired of can openers that left little burrs '' or that were difficult to get started hesitant about buying a as seen on tv '' product but went for it works well amuses my toddler and the dogs overall happy with product hope it lasts
we are very pleased with this item and tried to purchase another just like it but you were out of them at the time
as a tea lover for 30 years i have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of and performance i 've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it 's still working perfectly it boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while
my only reservation is for safety sake it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet
and we 'll all have tea ! that is exactly what this was meant to do my wife likes to enjoy a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate when we are busy working outside in my garage workshop or doing what seems to be never ending yardwork this is the perfect outdoor electric kettle to have on hand we do n't have to worry that it might break like a glass carafe would and we do n't have to worry about turning it off i just fill it up put in on the tool bench plug it in and wait for it to do its thing ! all we have to do is sit down on the patio admire mother nature and enjoy a good hot cup of tea !
this kettle is amazing it 's simple you plug it in and flip the switch a light turns on to let you know it 's working it heats very quickly 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea it heats in about 3. for students in dorms you can use it for oatmeal soup tea automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute so no worries about fire hazards great product i use it every day
i love and and bought one for my parents as well as my in laws for my morning tea favorite feature is the auto shut off i can flip the switch get ready for work and water is ready to pour i do n't have to worry about running to the kettle once the water has boiled i highly recommend this product
great little gadget for heating water i do n't have to monitor it since it has an auto off the water is steaming hot great for a tea drinker like me great price too ! i bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms i have been using it at home so far i am going to give it a spin travel this thanksgiving unbeatable for the 10 i paid for it
the kittle looks good and i tried it was not very fast but was accepted
this electric kettle is awesome it boil water in no find any better one with this price !
it 's great for the price so far so good heats water fast light weight
i love this electric kettle ! i use it 3 or 4 times a day to boil water for french press coffee oatmeal tea etc i have not had the problems with the lid which others have clicking it closed before turning it on is a and i have never been splashed with water it heats the water quickly even when filled to the max level and the feature has never failed the size is perfect and the detachable cord is a huge bonus i also feel it is sturdy enough the light weight does not feel 'cheap ' it makes it easy to handle even when full well worth the money you will not be disappointed
i have done a lot of dog training but i have never trained in agility before and was looking to teach my dogs something new i have enjoyed using the tunnel inside during the heat of the summer to train my dogs and give them an activity to do once they got the idea they really enjoyed it i am eager to try the other equipment outside now that the temperature has cooled this product could have gotten a higher rating but the instruction manual was terrible the teaching methods in the training manual go against a dog 's natural instinct i would recommend buying a book or researching the proper way to train for agility than to rely on the instruction manual
this is the greatest ! i had been pricing kits at about 1500 and more this was the answer to my dreams it is good quality simple and is all you need for your dog to learn and have a great time
your product 's name that really describes what the product really does ! it is amazing that the hair magnet really is easy to use and more amazing is the manner in which it preformes gathering pet hair
this is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go it 's not a quick removal tool think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming but for things like wool dhurrie rugs it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things it really does pull up tons of fur even from deep in a rug
as a military spouse we move and have different types of floors that need cleaning i have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home and also in our previous home abroad the vaccum side does not work well at all but i prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how i mop in comparison to sponge and rag mops this leaves the floor pretty dry and the suction is great as long as you empty the tank and keep it clean and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank it works wonderfully it 's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers that generally just push dirt around i believe it 's worth the i 've had mine for two years now
the bissell saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop
i looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one i chose the for the price which was much lower and for the size this unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around i felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out i have wood floors in the kitchen nook and foyer and i can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over it 's not any faster than mopping but it 's much easier my floors really clean and who would n't love that
product arrived on day promised the cleaner was ordered by my mother who is no longer physically able to keep her bare floors as clean as desired by other methods she tells me that she is very satisfied with the product it cleans the floor to her high standards with a minimum of time and labor
i bought this bark stop because my neighbor has a pit bull that stays out barking and the shared fence is about 15 feet from my bedroom window the dog barks so loud there is no where in my house that i can retreat to for silence i bought this super bark stop in hopes of quieting the dog the dog is so stupid that it barks even more when the noise starts up so we turned the volume up so that the neighors hear it too that 's what did it as soon as the dog started barking and the alarm sounded the dog was brought in that was until the neighbor broke it with a broom stick so we are buying another one too bad for them
peace at last ! ! ! ! ! we have only had this for 4 days but we are very happy i ordered this because of rude neighbors who leave there 2 dogs who bark and bark and they do n't stop out is a dog run outside our bedroom window other neigbors have complained as well they still wo n't do anything after setting up the bark stop it did n't take long before they got the idea they get 1 or 2 barks out then nothing SMILE i called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs trying to bark '' i told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it she thought that was great now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard update okay the real test came last night and again this was the test sirens ! ! ! i just had to laugh they could n't bark and howl ! ! ! all i heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them i am so glad we bought this ! ! ! !
i have really loved this set it looks great cleans easily and i love cooking with it you really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking but once i got used to that i have n't had any problems
after 40 years of marriage i have finally found cookware that lives up to its description i enjoy cooking with these pots they cook evenly and are a breeze to clean the handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling even like the glass lids that allow me to see what 's happening without lifting the lid i just recommended them to my
i purchased this cookware based on very favorable reviews and i 'm happy to say that these pots and pans are great ! both my husband and i enjoy cooking and he 's as happy with this cookware as i am he keeps telling me what a great buy i made ! i really like being able to cook at lower temps and i love the glass lids anyone looking for excellent cookware at a reasonable price should buy this product
bought this item for my daughter and she loves it threw away her old stuff because of this says in makes cooking enjoyable
as most people do i had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years it was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great cuisinart chef 's classic set i especially love the saute pan
i was very impressed with this cookware i was a little skecptical about the handles being stainless steel because i thought they would be too hot to the touch while cooking however i have had no problems picking up the pots or pans by the handle while they are still hot this is an exceptional buy for the money
just got these about 3 weeks ago they cook very well and i really like the see though lids the only thing i consider a con is that the food cooked in the pans can collect around the rivet '' that was used to secure the handle to the pan kind of a pain to keep that area clean overall very satisfied with the pans
wonderful set also got the stockpot with this free so very slickdeal SMILE great nonstick coating but you really must hand wash but that is ok ! !
good combination i keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have no worry about changing batteries
accessory for the led version of zelco 's excellent itty bitty booklight '' assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days
this will be the third thumper i 've bought lost the first one on a trip second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift it 's simple to use loud enough to wake you and does n't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes the thumper pad is big enough to hit when you 're groggy ! more products should be as easy to live with as this one !
having problems hanging your family photos this is the perfect product and inexpensive sooooooo easy
these are great i hung a heavy picture using one of these hooks and it is still hanging it was very easy to use
works as advertised can not be used if wall stud is directly behind use point at roughly 1 per hook a hammer and nail makes more sense
i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than 5 same concept just a lot cheaper ! two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they 're holding i 'm sure it 's pinhole sized if you 're hanging something that weighs a few ounces in which case you do n't need this use a pushpin ! the holes from the shelf are bigger than but it is a heavy shelf the hole is still way smaller than the hole i 'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you do n't do it right your object is gon na be crooked but on the bright side you wo n't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it ! recommended product but look around for the knockoffs
these hercules hooks are absolutely incredible i wish i had them before my husband put many many holes in our walls with anchors and screws if i want to relocate anything he tries to patch up the hole but it always shows these hooks make only a pin sized hole ! i hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it it is still there incredible product and well worth the price
this is a excellent as described very easy to incert and position have n't checked the weight not disappointed
these hooks are incredible ! ! i have used them throughout my home to hang heavy art work and mirrors and the best part is that i can do it myself without waiting for my husband to get out his drill hammer leveler etc i love them so much we have given them as house warming gifts and everyone that has received them from us has been as amazed as we are by how effective and easy they are to use ! if you want a secure and quick way to hang anything on your walls without making a huge hole use these hooks !
i am very pleased with this fryer it heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods unlike most consumer grade fryers this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries other fryers 'choke ' lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together not with this baby i used a coupon got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister this was a great deal
bought ours two years ago after considerable research busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout not one problem yet best one on the market as far as i am concerned
this is a well thought out product for consumer use easy to clean easy to use tried others and was very disappointed but i 'm extremely pleased with this one some advice stay away from the
i purchased this deep fryer after doing considerable research i wanted one with a good capacity and that would be reliable it has surpassed my expectations we have been using it for over a month the initial use was to fry chicken tenders for a large party 15 lbs of chicken tenders were fried in no time with very little oil useage since that time we have fried okra french fries tater tots onion petals cheese sticks and even did fried ice cream all have turned out very well it holds a little shy of 1 gallon of oil this heats up in about 10 minutes there is an indicator light to let one know when it is up to temperature once frozen food is put in the oil quickly comes back up to temperature this produces crisp foods with no oily taste and very little oil useage it has a breakaway magnetic cord to keep it from accidently being pulled off of the counter it cleans up as easily as can be expected i just put the basket and the oil resevoir in the dishwasher the food can be lowered into the oil with the lid in place this keeps oil spatters to a bare minimum i have been very happy with my purchase so have the hoards of teenagers that gather at my house there has even been one instance when they brought the food and did their own frying although frying is not the most healthy way to prepare food at least with this deep fryer it is easy quick tasty nearly and about as grease free as possible while this one costs a bit more than others on the market i certainly feel as though i am getting my money 's worth
i 've always wanted a deep fryer and finally decided to take the plunge after doing quite a bit of research i decided on this model picked one up at bed bath and beyond with a 20 coupon in my opinion you generally get what you pay for so the extra cost competitors was n't a real concern i must say overall i am quite pleased while i am new to frying i found it extraordinarily easy it is pretty hot though so be careful only complaint would be that the capacity is a little on the small side say if you 're cooking entrees for a larger family for example you can really only fit 3 maybe 4 pieces of chicken at a time but since the chicken needs to cool down anyway this was n't such a major issue it came out nice crispy and golden brown not too soggy not too crisp perfect i figure if it can handle the chicken vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake although i 've only fried a couple of batches i am beyond pleased but i 'll let you know if i have any problems great item so far though
easy to use easy to clean two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy this thing is easier to clean than my old george foreman grill and that to me was a pain in the neck the only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil which i do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much i 've used it and what i 've cooked if i 'm doing just veggies i keep the oil if i do a meat or seafood i 'll change the oil right after very pleased overall
i purchased this for my wife a hundred bucks for a knife insane ! until you use it i think this is worth the money my wife says is the best thing since sliced bread and you can slice bread with it seriously great knife it will last a long time do n't keep buy cheapo knives year after year just get one of these very sharp edge nice weight and comfortable
after working with a combination of german knives for more than ten years i decided to buy a global knife and give it a shot it feels great in my hand and is easy to handle and work with the blade is incredibly sharp and has held its edge very well all in all i liked this knife so much that i decided i wanted more of them and bought the set i ca n't give it a much better endorsement than that
i bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable as a vegetarian i use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless money very well spent as i know it 'll last a lifetime
i originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant i work at had one i picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind a couple weeks later i bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener i have no idea what that other guy must be doing to his knife but my blade sharpens very easily and stays sharp for months as long as you do n't abuse it by far my favorite knife that i have used one warning though if you are going to do a large amount of chopping like say you 're a prep cook or you make dinners twice a month then the angled shape of the back of the blade may rub the side of your index finger the wrong way i cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday and have only been irritated by the shape a few times under heavy chopping regimes but it is something to consider overall i could n't love this knife more it 's the most important kitchen tool i have ever owned
i 've been a german knife snob for years but this chef 's knife by japan 's global is the finest blade i 've ever owned period maybe it 's not as easy to sharpen as a wustof or a henckel but then again it holds its edge ten times longer i 've spent ten years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds ! of dollars collecting german steel global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again
i baught my 8 '' global chef 's knife about 5 years ago it has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market the steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its counterparts my only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style nor my large hands i do n't mind the steel handles although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip my main problem is with the tapered bolster which is almost a lack of bolster altogether coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand i highly recommend globals but i might suggest the 8 '' heavyweight model which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the bolster for more info on knife handling and care you might check out the cia 's book titled the professional chef 's knife kit '' and one last comment although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe please please do n't put your knives in the dishwasher
i desperately needed a new knife because my old chicago cutlery wooden handle knife became a gross and nasty coli distributing piece of junk which was very sad because i loved that knife ! i had it for years i ended up buying this knife because i really liked the look of the handle it looked like it would grip well and it does to me it seemed a bit expensive but the stainless chicago cutlery knives handles were very smooth so there were few choices for me the most important point is what ever brand you choose go with handles do n't make the mistake that i made by holding on to those old wooden handle knives bacteria will eventually get in them and then they will make you sick
we have sabatier and wusthof sets but this is the first knife that every one of the family goes for first perfect balance easy to sharpen cuts meat juliennes perfectly even slices tomatoes pair this with the global paring knife and really that 's all you need although my wife now wants her own for christmas clearly she 's an incurable romantic
i have a number of booklites different vendors different styles some ac adapter some straight battery cheap to higher prices and this one is the best the brightest the one i will most often use it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times i am careful with such items do n't expect any problems most booklites are not meant to be manhandled
i have looked over this product it is a birthday present for someone else so i have n't actually used it and find that it meets all my expectatons for size light weight design
very well made reading light nice carrying case decent battery consumption fits most of the books really well happy reading
i have tried a number of different booklights and they all go through batteries in about 5 minutes this light can be purchased with an ac adapter eliminating the need to constantly replace batteries it is bright enough to clearly illuminate the pages of your book stays where it 's clipped and reasonably adjustable i love it
i love this light ! i spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book disturbing my husband it 's also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs like most other reading lights couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance
so far i have been very happy with my zo i agree with others about the low baking temp on my bread was much lighter than expected but i would n't go so far as to say the loaf was undercooked it was well formed and airy just looked like i had baked it on a lower setting oh but the shape of the loaf was perfect looked like it came from a bakery except with paddle holes on the bottom the two paddles worked great much better than my previous breadman and more scraping the ! as far as needing more control not sure why you would buy a bread machine at all with my previous machines i only used the dough setting and baked in my own reg oven they were n't capable of baking an edible loaf this machine does offer the home made settings that allows you to control rising time kneading time etc if someone needs more than that just make the dough in the machine and let it rise on your counter to your hearts content hard part is done by the zo let 's face it if we were professional bakers would we be buying a bread machine at all bottom zo is an exceptional bread machine that offers more versatility than most creates an attractive well formed loaf does a wonderful job of mixing the ingredients thoroughly with the two paddles extremely easy to clean and the zo has made it extremely easy to remove the forward and slide out i used to wrestle forever with my last one one other note someone mentioned the pan warping a little common sense will make this pan last for many years ! just read the manual i have never had a problem with any of my machines and this pan is significantly better than my last one that i used for 4 yrs
i bought this breadmaker because i wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf it makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and i recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen ! i have not bought a loaf of bread since i 've owned this fine bread making machine
i 've been using my zojirushi for over two years now and make at least a couple loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread a week along with fancier breads using the dough function i love the fact that there are two paddles to knead the bread this works so much better than my machine of 10 years ago with just one paddle which often left gobs of unkneaded incredients i also really like the horizontal full loaf pan you can make normal sandwich loaves with this design the one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting rising and baking times individually sometimes i want the dough to rise longer than the preset times but there 's no way of overriding it oh well guess nothing is perfect i highly recommend this product
i have had 4 different bread machines all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style i did n't mind the bread they turned out but i did n't like the loaf shape my prayers have been answered ! i ca n't quit making bread now ! the loaves come out perfect and if they do n't i have come to relize that with bread it is typically the cook 's error not the machine 's you need to really read the directions which i find most people do n't if you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it i 've made all kinds of sweet sourdough french italian herb and cheese fruit and beer breads in the machine name it and they all come out just fine if not i tweak the recipe i do n't blame the machine all in all an excellent product this is my favorite bread machine so far the only down side is the sourdough setting do n't be fooled the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar for true sourdough you have to wait the days but if you ca n't wait oh and the big viewing window '' unless someone installs a light inside the machine you ca n't really see what 's going on anyway after my first 50 loaves i will let you know how it 's holding up
i own the zojirushi bread machine for about a year i bake per week the machine makes excellent bread dough i have n't bought a loaf of bread since i bought this machine when i want a more crusty bread make pizza or make a foccacia i use the dough cycle with amazing results highly reccomend this product it takes a little practice if you never used a bread machine before read instuctions carefully measure ingredients if your bread is slopsided watch for drafts most of my breads come out looking picture perfect the taste you ca n't compare it with store bought bread plus no preservatives or additives of any kind
i bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and i use it every day the white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time i 've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs i tried one wheat bread loaf it was very tasty but not quite the consistency that i like so i need to play around with that one alittle bit i 've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before but now that my kids are grown up i now have some time to work in the kitchen i highly recommend this machine
i have been using six second abs for a month i can see my stomach getting flatter so i wouldnt believe the commericals that say it took them a week to get a six pack but if you want a flatter stomach then this will help overtime
contrary to the opinion expressed in the previous review i found the resistance levels more than adequate it might be that it was being used incorrectly by using the back and arms rather than pulling from the abs i developed very good ab definition after around 2 months working out at 120 crunches on my back 3 only problem was the machine broke when it was n't even on the highest setting but i intend buying another
i gave this to my neighbor across the street who said he 'd tried everything on his dog and had decided she was just a barker '' it worked immediately and completely i would only use it in ultrasonic mode because the audible mode will further annoy your neighbors before i found this device i used a hose on a dog who barked under my window at various times of the night during the summer i had to squirt the dog 3 or 4 times for a couple of nights and then the dog shut up dogs should sleep in the house at night
i used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy australian shepherds one of them next door and two more on the other side of it so they were two doors down from me i was skeptical but the dog were driving us nuts i installed a bark free before the super model was released and the dogs quickly learned to shut up it was remarkable they would still bark once or twice if they got but it stopped nearly 100 of their bored i wish someone would let me exercise '' barking i only considered using the ultrasonic mode my only other word of advice is that a competitive product the dog silencer pro is a worthless piece of garbage and even in ultrasonic '' mode it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone including humans avoid that one at all costs
we bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously i confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking he told me if i had a problem with his dog barking to call the police i did ! he tried to have a restraining order put on us so we could n't call the police the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet which he never did so when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic the dogs kennel is about from my garage where i hung it the barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be i have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also apparently they do n't like to hear it ! too bad so sad ! the dog gets used to it so every once in a while i unplug it for a day or so when it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference it has really helped us where the neighbor would n't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking
i have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she did n't get her way she was becoming intolerable barking at all hours of the night disturbing everyone around she is extremely fragile with a heart condition and i felt a shock collar could kill her i will admit i was very skeptical about this spray collar but i was desperate anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train so i tried the collar and i am very happy to report it works tallys barking has returned to its normal level which was infrequent it happened quickly within a few days we followed the directions on the box which are very important and had good results i ca n't promise this will work for every dog but it worked well for ours without resorting to shocks i do n't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work although i do ocassionaly with tally to refresh her training i feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions and you will get results fairly quickly i am quite satisfied with this product
the premier collar was the best solution to help my dog restrain from barking without any injury to him ! ! he learned within a few days while on walks to stop barking at other dogs when wearing the collar i did n't want to use the shock method but my groomer told me about the premier citronella collar to aid in his training we got good results !
my grandma 's 10 year old yorkie just would never shut up he barked at our cat at our parrot and anything that moved really we bought this collar and it worked perfectly and immediately one bark and it sprayed and he would go running off and stop barking ! i felt kinda bad for him but his reaction was hilarious i could n't stop laughing at him poor thing however he did learn that if the collar was n't on he was n't going to get sprayed so he would bark
i thought i 'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix i did not want to try a shock collar but i was concerned that this collar would be too large for her she 's only 8 lbs although it looks a little large she does n't appear uncomfortable at all and wow did this work ! the spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark immediately after the first days she is barking less in general and does n't have to wear the collar all that often it 's been 5 days and i do n't think she will need to wear it forever this product has been a total lifesaver and my dog is happy too
this is a great product we have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people kids bikes dogs and pretty much anything we use the collar on him maybe 2 times and now he hardly ever barks in the car we still use the collar once in awhile we are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach so far we like it a lot
we use these more than any other dishware items in our pantry they go from the fridge to the microwave to the oven plus they are indestructable whether dropped banged in the dishwasher or otherwise abused they are pretty small however u can fit a can of corn or heat up a chicken breast or two in the microwave but not much more fits into it we have 8 for a family of 4 and we could use a couple more if we had the space so buy extras
i only bought 2 and now wish i 'd purchased 8. they are heavy and appear very durable the lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal actually much better than expected wait for them to reappear on the friday sale and save a couple of bucks i assure you you wo n't be disappointed
it is the perfect size for a bowl to eat out of it has a lid so it is good for leftovers or taking to work and having a handle is great there are no worries about taking a hot dish out of the microwave you just grab the handle and eat probably ideal for teens or college kids also they also hold up well we have a couple that are about 10 years old and recently bought some more on amazon
i love the ! they are wonderful i was so disappointed when the outlet store i used to buy them from told me that they no longer make these so i am thrilled that i was still able to find these online and with the lids ! ! ! thank you so much !
i 've got one of these floating around my house without the lid with the other common '' shared and i have to say everyone loves this one i think it 's great of the handle more than anything else college students like handles on their dishes
i bought this to use for brown bagging '' but have used it for so much more this little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks all without having to change the contents to a dressier '' dish french white is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money
i love these dishes i bought these because i need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white they mix with the set beautifully ! i like the feel of the classic wedgewood bone china so i 'm glad they priced this set so i can afford to use them for everyday dishes the packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes but surprising everything made to me in one piece so i 'm very happy with my purchase
i love all my calphalon pots pans and bakeware best set i have every owned or used even heat easy clean up i have never made reductions as easily as i have in these pots pans the fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top i paid 24.99 for this when i bought a few other pieces got free shipping 25.00 off the order
it works great and i like being able to use metal spoons it apears to be of great quality
very pleased with the quality of this pan good weight and cooks food evenly clean up is easy too good product
this was my first calaphalon purchase and i am so impressed that i plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future this pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 qt unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food hand washing the pan is easy i love this pan ! !
loved this pan i got several others too price was much below average
i am so over nonstick even calphalons i have been gradually replacing all my nonstick with uncoated cookware this saucepan really rocks i use it all the time i do n't have to worry about scratching it and i really have n't had much trouble with clean up
i purchased this pot in january and have used it several times a week since i love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review the pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well and i looked forward to years of use until i boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles the noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking scrubbing cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot i will definatly be purchasing another pot overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch i would totally reccomend it just do n't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes
i like the size and shape of this saucepan it is big enough for something like spaghetti sauce or even mashed potatoes but not so big is overwhelms smaller jobs cleans up nice and the lid is good
i bought this for mother 's day for my mother and mother in law and they both have said that they are still going strong i was a little skeptical at first but they came though oh and for the other reviewer who wrote they are cheaper on is correct but shipping is almost 20 so this is a better deal by far ! i liked this so much i am sending it to someone else
this is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma i am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants it would make a great gift as well
sent to my daughter in ca for her birthday she loves the gardenia the service was excellent thanks to frances emily and
i bought this bookstand at the beginning of after a lengthy search and lots of testing this bookstand is metal and it has a rubber serrated grip to hold the base of a book in a variety of positions for me this is a key feature i use the bookstand at many different locations and i use desks and tables of different heights i adjust the main angle the stand in the back and furtther adjust the book 's angle by wedging the spine into a rubber slot at the base i should note two other benefits first for a year and a half i 've put 1200 page casebooks in this book stand and it 's never bent and i can get the spines of those casebooks to flatten out with the stabilizer arm huge second i can lean into my casebooks and write in the margins this bookstand support my upperbody weight i do n't think you 'll find a plastic stand or a wire stand that will do that in sum if you 're in law school this stand will be your best friend your neck muscles will appreciate the investment
this book stand is an absolute necessity if you 're a college student and even if you 're reading for leisure i love having my hands free to drink a coffee or snack or anything else i want to do
after recently returning to school i was quickly reminded how tough reading textbooks is on one 's neck especially while trying to take notes at the same time after looking at several other book stands this seemed to be the best choice i have n't had any trouble with my textbooks both hardcover and softcover even if you 're not experiencing neck pain from reading it 's a good idea to create a more ergonomic study space for yourself it also should be especially useful for those working on smaller desktops that need to have a notebook or binder open as well i 'm sure this stand could also be useful when retyping documents as well
i first bought one of these at barnes noble or maybe through levenger about 5 years ago lost it traveling and spent hours and hours and hours searching the web going to stores etc looking for another one but it was out of production i bought other book stands in the interim and looked at countless pictures of others but none came close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this little guy tne design is near perfect it folds up so you can flatten it stick it in your book it has little feet that hold the pages of even a realy thick paper back down it 's flat surface balances on just about anything i balance it on a pillow when i 'm reading in bed it adjusts to different angles it 's is a near perfect design i 've given this as a present and the response is always the same how did i ever live withouth this '' if you 're a reader do not hesitate my motive for encouraging you if more people buy them they 'll never go out of production and i wo n't have to worry about losing mine ever again absolutely essential for readers
we have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device we ordered the bark stop pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking we were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we 're very thankful that this device works you have to use the high frequency for the big dogs we would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog
i bought the bark stop about 2 weeks ago i had read several reviews either really good or really bad so i was quite skeptical but my dog jack russell terrier would bark at the rays of sunlight coming into the house so i was desperate the most important thing to remember when buying a product like this is that there are n't many things that are both great and easy when you buy treats for dog to train him do you simply leave the treats out all the time no because he would never figure out that the treats were a reward for doing what you wanted him to it 's the same thing with the bark stop the first thing you should do with this device is put it to the audible setting and then test and see what makes the bark stop actually go off i found that doors shutting hard clanging dishes etc all set it off so if the device goes off every 5 seconds the dog is n't going to think for a second that it 's going off because he 's barking he 's going to assume that it 's a uncontrollable sound that he has to live with so after putting the device back into the ultrasonic sound setting i decided that i would only plug the device in when the dog was barking or when he was in his cage also i never leave the device plugged in when i 'm doing dishes slamming doors or doing loud things so the dog only hears the device when he barks i realize that this might be a slight annoyance to walk on egg shells in order to make sure the device works but i would rather do that than have a barking dog the way i look at it is i would n't just randoming throw my dog treats in the middle of his training so why leave it plugged in all the time in the end the first time i plugged in the bark stop i let the dog bark it out he barked for about 5 minutes normally and then stopped the second time i plugged it in he did n't bark more than twice the bark stop puts out a ultrasonic beep when you plug it in so i think that now he knows when he 's going to hear more than he wants to i think that the dog has now gotten more used to it and will try to out bark it but for the most part he does n't bark much at all while it 's on if he barks at all the one thing that the manual does say is that if the dog is trying to protect the house usually this device wo n't help which i think is a good thing cons when i was testing the microphone used for taking in the bark loudness on the device it did n't seem to matter if the microphone was on high or low also this device would be so much more useful if it came with a remote to turn on or off not to manage each bark but to simply be able to sit at the couch and click it on or to click it off
the money tree arrived today on time it was a gift to me SMILE i opened the box and could n't believe how perfect this tree was i 'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon especially for the holidays the roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree thanks
i have ten dogs and eleven cats plus i volunteer at a local rescue group and i always keep a couple of bottles in my medicine chest two of my dogs use it all the time a golden retriever with allergies and a cocker spaniel with chronic ear infections due to severe neglect in his previous life zymox with hydrocortisone has an enzyme that promotes natural healing plus the hydrocortisone takes the itch away so they do n't scratch themselves raw thus the infection i also use it on the ocassional yeast or bacterial infection you do n't even have to guess what kind because it works for both twice a day for a couple of weeks takes care of it without having to pay a vet 's examination fee
my dog had ear problems for years and finally came across this product cleared it up in one week with only a couple of applications i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with chronic ear problems
my chihuahua has had chronic ear problems since he was a little puppy i 'm not a fan of the antibiotic ointments that vets prescribe because they contain medication he does n't need for his yeast problems i 've tried all sorts of natural ear cleansers to no avail i found this product highly recommended by an online vet site so i thought i 'd give it a shot within 2 days his ears looked perfect no scratching or shaking either it 's been 3 weeks since i last put in the drops and i have n't had to worry about them since i honestly ca n't believe how well this solution works i 'm so happy my little guy is n't feeling miserable with his ears anymore
used vet 's rx to treat my dog 's ear and it didnt seem to work after reading reviews i decided to try this after only 1 week i noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better would recommend to others
my beagles have chronic ear infections and i was spending hundreds of dollars per year to keep them in check doctor visits in order to get the prescribed and expensive zymox otic has solved the problem keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when i started it be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection
irecently purchased a bottle of zymox with hydrocortisone for my lab who has had several really bad ear infections i was spending a fortune at the vets searched the web until i read about this decided to give it a sooooo glad i works ! her ears are clear she is happy will keep buying this you zymox
this product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments i had received there zymox takes about a week to work with one or two treatments a day it has had the same effect for my sister 's dog who had had recurrent ear infections i have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success
my 10 yr old cocker spaniel has had cronic ear infections for 4 yrs she has developed a resistance towards most antibiotics and steroids and all antibiotics make her stomach sour some antibiotics even make her ears worse ! nothing works completely but zymox seems to give her a reasonable comfort zone without zymox expensive total ear canal ablation surgery would be her only option after expensive tplo surgery and 4 years of ear infections my finances have been exhausted zymox has given me better results than the vet saves 150 a month vs the vet and is well worth the daily ear cleaning and drops
i read about zymox on a vet 's website regarding chronic ear infections my black lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when i found her the usual story of rounds of antibiotics including expensive baytril without resolution of her problem it 's been almost a month now and her ears are improving i find that i can not skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs but if done daily she has little goo i plan on continuing every day and i hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics
this is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver i am purchasing another one because it 's working so well i am a professional dog trainer and all i can say is that the product is great but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed as a professional dog trainer i still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers our toy poodle was essentially when i was home but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out she ended up peeing in front of the door because nobody was letting her out so i got the lentek door chime and taught my dog to use it and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear we also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in everybody is happy now i 'm getting another pad for upstairs because we still have oblivious teens and hubby so great product but be sure that you have parts of the product and give a good trainer a call to help you get started
it takes a little patience to get the dog to use it at first she thought is was a treat machine but eventually she realized it meant go outside works very well
easy to use our dog learned how to use it reliably in a couple of days no directions came with it we called our trainer and asked how to do it
i hung 2 big jingle bells on a sturdy ribbon by the door it accomplishes the same thing with no batteries to worry about ! consistantly ring the bell before opening the door and he 'll learn in 2 or 3 days
we love our pet chime it took a little time to train our dog on it but now it 's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out it 's also a great conversation piece when company is over we 've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and have n't had any problems we 're getting an extra paw
i 've used the itty bitty booklight for years the edition is a welcome improvement it 's much easier to turn and the light stays in place after months of use the light on the original model tends to swivel after time
i am looking for a new book light and as a former owner of this light i was suprised at the bad bulb stats this bulb like halogen bulbs get very hot it is imperative that you do not touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it the oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp and hastens failure hope this help
i own two that include the ac adapter they are great bright lights i used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily replacement bulbs are not hard to find do n't bother paying for high priced zelco bulbs i bought my generic replacements at walmart in the area they sell flashlights i use rechargeable batteries they probably last hours on a fresh charge maybe longer i 've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period i put it on the visor the lights are very bright in some circumstances they might be too bright but that would be a weird complaint for a light huh
this book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person i use it with the converter so i can plug it into the wall but the battery adapter works well for travel i have also used it to read in the car i wish the wiring was a little heavier as this was where my former light failed but it lasted for several years with regular use
i bought this light for my wife several months ago there have been absolutely no problems and it even seems to be holding up better than my original itty bitty book light i would get this one for myself if i decide to get another one but i 'm also checking out the flourescent one which is supposed to never need a new bulb and you can hardly find the bulbs for the regular ones anymore unless you go to zelco 's website
buy this poster if you like spooky things but do n't say you were not warned you are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around this is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books the movie encompasses several of the first books of the series and the poster is indicative of both you will need room to display this 27 x 40 poster i suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks
for those of you unfamiliar with the a series of unfortunate events '' books they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional baudelaire orphans and their struggles to overcome adversity after adversity after adversity ad infinitum hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional brief glimpses of happiness is their distant cousin the scheming greedy conniving ruthless cousin the count given the concept of the story this poster fits perfectly with the orphans standing together but otherwise alone in the middle with the shadow of the count casting gloom upon them it is a perfect fit as is the casting of jim carrey as the count
glad to see they still make this clock yea the parts are simple but i love the way it looks on on my wall i even changed the dots when i moved it used to be on a white wall now it looks even cooler in my new place my own white dots on a glass wall the one i had for years just died i 'm ordering another one hopefully it 'll last as long
i was searching for a juicer for a long time and was contemplating the jack lalanne juicer which my brother had i came across this and was a little skeptical but after making the purchase i am totally satisfied i like the stainless steel construction it is very well made solid and sturdy it comes apart very easy and most of the time you just need to scrape out the left over and rinse with hot water to clean it i ca n't believe i have gone so long without juicing i 've never been much of a fruit eater other than apples and bananas but since buying this product i have made apple and carrot drinks watermelon and cantaloupe its great i actually feel the difference inside within a short time i read one review that this juicer leaves juice left over in the pulp but i did not find that to be true i think it all depends if your trying to force the fruit through to quickly it you do n't press to hard on the chute feeder and let the machine do the work the pulp is quite dry i got one litre of cantaloupe juice from one cantaloupe i went out and purchased some 1 liter bottles and i just fill them up so i can mix and match to my aquired taste i got of a liter from about an of a full water melon anyway i am thinking of purchasing one for my friend and his wife as a christmas gift great stuff
it 's hard to find anything wrong with such a damn good juicer that i only paid 25 for what can beat that money very well spent it does spray a little depending on what you 're putting in but again what juicer does n't i can live with this for 25 ! wear an apron duh it does say in the manual that it does n't do wheatgrass i missed that bit but no biggie ! i can cope for only carrots beets celery cabbage ginger cucumber peppers apples pears etc all hard veg and fruit are just perfect it does these really well i adore oranges done in this juicer with all the pith on they come out so creamy ! not acidic like regular oj i 'm still hooked got my juicer a few weeks back and i 'm still using it daily it 's awesome
i 'd been looking for a good juicer for a number of months but had shied away because they 're expensive i saw this deal read and analyzed the reviews and rolled the dice it arrived yesterday and after easily disassembling it to wash the parts and get to know it initially i ran a half dozen carrots through it omg ! ! fast and delicious carrot juice in my own kitchen ! was easy well i was an old pro by now and quick under five minutes to address some of the negatives you may read first size of course it 's big they 're all big and bulky it 's their nature second residue my carrot pulp was dry i suppose if i 'd put it on the floor and stood on it i might have gotten maybe another teaspoon of carrot juice out of it third it 's factory reconditioned for me that 's a plus consider this the manufacturer rolls out tens of thousands of these off the line each one and polished by qc before bagging and boxing assuming that they are all good to go but a factory is gone over from top to bottem inside and out before it 's released no assumptions the last thing the manufacturer wants is to see that thing back again so you know they 'll make sure they do n't and if it 'd been returned for a little cosmetic blem i can certainly live with that considering the discount i 'm getting i 'm still not sure why they 're virtually giving these away but waring is an old and trusted brand and the juicer is not cheaply made i 'll be back in a year hopefully not sooner to give some time perspective to this review as soon as i finish writing this i 'm ordering two more as christmas gifts
though i have not tried the juicer yet but i could not pass off the price
i am very happy with it inexpensive easy to clean and highly recommend
i 've wanted a juicer for a long time but could never really justify the expense knowing that i 'd very likely quickly tire of the maintenance involved when i saw this juicer for under 25 it seemed like the perfect opportunity when i opened the box i was immediately impressed with the unit 's solid construction you can see right away that this is n't a plastic piece of junk that 's going to break righ away with the unit 's first use i juiced cabbage kale spinach carrots onions and peppers the unit while not as powerful as more expensive models i 'm sure juiced up everything with no hesitation i would describe the pulp to be damp but not what i 'd call really wet i dreaded the juicer process that i 'd heard so much about disassembly of the unit is a breeze there are basically three main parts to remove and it takes all of no problem if there 's one thing i could change it would be a better designed that would allow a bag to be used this is only a minor gripe and has in no way made me regret the purchase if you are a casual juicer looking to get your feet wet without spending a ton of money this would be a perfect choice i 'm still amazed that i got this for under 25 and i 'd recommend it without hesitation
i would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone ! it is stylish sleek easy to clean and has plenty of power to handle anything i feel sorry for michigan mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink ! awesome ! awesome the first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol ' prune who would n't be happy with anything ! get it now !
i 'm absolutely thilled with this waring ! it 's definitely changed my opinion of juicers i purchased the reconditioned model it arrived factory re and looked brand new not a single mark on it not even a fingerprint ! it 's far easier to clean obviously by superior design the parts clean up like new in the dishwasher the components fit perfectly despite probably a couple hundred uses it 's exponentially faster and the remainders are noticeably dryer as another reviewer mentioned this refuse obviously indicates a very efficient juicer ! looks sounds and functions like a very upscale appliance no spraying no movement no juicer drama '' ! SMILE absolutely the best one i 've owned and after lots of uses it 's still going as strong as it did when it arrived
this food coloring was the best i have ever used it is very concentrated i obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time i did not notice a flavor at all so i look forward to trying the black the bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish
i bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing the ateco food coloring gave nice bright vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well i was totally satisfied with the purchase
these are easy to use they do not make a mess and offer vibrant colors they do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can i would highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate
i purchased 3 units and they work well for us i have 2 units in children 's bedrooms on ac power and the in the kitchen on batteries for portability the sound is clear and and use is very easy the best thing about these units is the vox answer option i have this option turned on in the kid 's room and they merely have to answer back when i talk to them first without having to push the talk '' button this is very handy when you are talking to a 3 old that does n't quite understand how to use this i attached a large very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and i keep it on my fridge but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary the only small annoying feature is every time the talk '' button is pressed a beep occurs but the other features outweight that small annoyance for me
purchased to replace our constantly broken intercom system installation is a matter of pushing a button so even i was able to do it and i love the fact that i can carry the station to the washer or outside wherever we also bought the outdoor station and put it at the front now when i 'm outside i do n't have to worry about not hearing the doorbell
i think this is a greater product unlike other intercom systems i 've bought this one is wireless and the sound is clear
i purchased 2 of these cages and my first comment is that the picture of the cage is just what you are getting it is hard to find a large cage for parakeets with the correct bar spacing so no one slips out this cage was the answer for all of our needs not only is the bar spacing great for our paratkeets but there is lots of room the stand that the cage sits on is very sturdy and does not wobble like a lot of cages that come with seperate stands assembly is also easy the only time i had to pull out a tool was to put the stand together and that was very easy to do if you are using this cage for parakeets you should use twisty ties to secure the doors even more parakeets love to lift the doors up and down and it is a matter of time before they realize they can also get out the cage is also very nice for our parakeets because it has different levels that the birds love to explore great cag
i was so thrilled when i unpacked my processor it is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance it has so many features that i love especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time the egg beater attachment is excellent also i am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all
the best salsa the best pesto and salad dressings made with this food processor we all should have one
this is a terrific machine amazon 's price beat everyone especially with their 20 promotional discount no sales tax and no shipping charges the oversized feed tube makes preparation much simpler as i do n't have to try to fit '' my ingredients into a narrow tube is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any it 's quiet and efficient i only wish that there were more outlets hear me amazon that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level overall i am highly satisfied and happy i spent a little more and got the best
this is our first food processor did a lot of looking before making this purchase it 's easy to use and clean made salsa with our garden fresh tomatoes the day it arrived makes slicing a breeze great price from amazon ! no complaints of any kind
this is the best kitchen appliance we own my wife has saved more time with this appliance very strong motor nice look our garden is all choppped up
very happy with the proformance of the the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done pizza still needs to be worked on fantastic product
the kitchenaid is exactly as advertised it has three nested work bowls the inner smallest one takes a special blade a smaller version of the standard processor blade it 's perfect for small quantities of things pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest 12 cup bowl a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box finally a way to keep everything together the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl it 's the kind with the rotating hub two hub sizes are included one for lemons and a larger one for oranges etc while it seems to work it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker but what the heck it 's worth trying the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it at first i was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options but after thinking about it you only need the provided on off and pulse would i buy it again absolutely would i buy it again from amazon again absolutely the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised
i loved this item until it became fused to the base i called cs and they sent me a prepaid ups label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a 50 off coupon to keep using kitchenaid very impressive

i had so many barking dogs that i was feeling like shooting them my rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog 's disruption of the neighborhood some kind of power thing i guess when ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill when my last short term renter a pastor yelled no ! at them i became desperate i had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs i was looking for a new collar cironella i plugged in anti bark and then up popped this super bark product i bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree the dogs barked the entire time right at the fence until my daughter turned it on they ran like bats out of hell back to their house and have n't been heard since ! now i was a little sceptical at first but i ca n't praise this product enough you can not get anything else that will do this for you you can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win if you move you might end up with more barking look it 's worth the money believe me ! ! ! !
i turned the device onto human sound because on i did n't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor 's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning the device itself on human sound was triggered by many things air condtioner mower air plane thunder etc which was not good in that i doubt it would serve as an effective training device the dogs seemed to trigger it at random times we have large lots here in this area of nj and i placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem however my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole i placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs ' outside times she advised me that her book clubs inside and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly the capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation i would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone
we have four dogs and they 're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking one of our neighbors strongly suggested '' this product as a possible remedy i did some investigation before purchasing including talking to the manufacturer their sense was that it works for about 50 of dogs which is in line with what i saw in other reviews at the time this was about a year and a half ago anyway because they had a good return policy i went ahead and made the purchase and it worked wonderfully the barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it and in fact we wished we had bought more we have a very big yard that led to our downfall we were moving it around frequently and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch oops needless to say it did n't work after that but remarkably the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months now the grass is green the buds are blooming and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive so it 's time to replace the unit this time i 'm buying two and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer
i was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie the barker and our collie the barker before investing in yet another bark deterrant '' we have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound while also using the reinforcing quiet '' after observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days we are ready to purchase i am sure that it probably wo n't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days ' or in households that are very active but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that wound up '' frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason considering the 50 cost in comparison to some products in the 100 range which quit and had to be immediately to not break training continuity check with a trainer boarder or groomer and test it out first we are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house
i was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my itty bitty book light at such a reasonable price fast shipping too
i bought this device one week ago and i like it a lot it counts steps pretty accurately i measured it three time and i got the following results and the first number is what it showed the second what i walked basically accuracy at 1 or better which is exceptional for this price i use the least sensitive setting the backlight is very nice and by tilting the device a bit more one can see the display clearly at night the clamshell design is also nice and practical avoiding pressing buttons accidentaly and resetting for example a day 's steps now do not buy this device for the fm radio the reception is pretty poor and the quality of sound when you get a signal is what you would expect from a device costing as much as this plus i guess it will deplete the batteries much faster than just the pedometer function i do not know if the other device of the same company with the calorie meter uses the same mechanism but probably it would be more practical and for the same price provide something more in conclusion this device has a good price for what it gives although there are accurate pedometers with less money that someone can buy but definately do not seem as sturdy personally i like this device a lot and i highly recommend it pending of course to see how long it will last as well as how long it takes to change batteries
excellent pedometer for the money worthwhile investment i only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity and now it works great radio works great definately reccommend
this pedometer is great it 's very small and very light i forget it 's even there it keeps me motivated to walk more and the radio is wonderful for walks around the neighborhood i have dropped it a couple of times but it has not damaged the pedometer at all it 's a great product and i definitely recommend it
i absolutely love this product my neighbor has four little yippers and my mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence i hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking arguments '' with my dog all barking and fighting has ceased all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now
i have a 3 year old boxer that barks cries whines and howls when i go to work all day i know i recorded it i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget brought it home and it the manual correct button she bolted she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i do n't crate my dog when i 'm going to be away for more than 8 hours so if i 'm just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i 'm going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he 's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it worth the price in my opinion best advice is to take it home and try it some dogs react to it others don't
i have a very actiuve border collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything ! i tried all the training methods i could find and nothing worked i then purchased a citronella spray gadget which did nothing i think she liked the perfume i was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices but just in time my nephew lent me his dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog i ca n't recommend it enough
i was amazed at how much i am enjoying my flavia fusion i saw it at a boat show and tried some my husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday i really love it i love the decaf house blend it is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf decaf tastes bad after it sits for 15 minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it the flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee i also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well i like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks it surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research before buying it it is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee the flavia is a luxury item not for a poor working stiff anyway the flavia is fast and simple and convenient in fact i 'm going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now enjoy it
i absolutely love this machine ! the selection of coffees and teas is wonderful i am a tea drinker primarily engish breakfast and chai latte and i am quite picky about the quality with some of the pod brewers i have tried the tea has been quite weak however with the flavia the engish breakfast tea is very good the chai is excellent as well the chai latte is very smooth and does n't have the peppery taste that some can have pros 1. great tasting coffees and teas 2. great selection 3. virtually no clean up 4. you can brew a cup of tea after making coffee and the tea does n't taste like coffee very important cons 1. you better make sure the bottom of the brewer is flush with the top of the cup or it will blow whatever you are brewing all over you and your kitchen this will only happen once trust me because you will not want this to happen again 2. you can only purchase coffees and teas through their website hopefully as this machine becomes more popular there will be more options for purchasing
what a quick easy way to make a great cup of coffee i like to mix the packs up and make my own brew i have freinds that love the machine and went and bought them one this is the best coffee machine we have ever i like is i can mix the diffrent packs and make my own brew that you cant get in a coffee shop or at the store hint get the vanilla syrup pack and add it in the mix
we have bought several coffee makers over the past few years seeking the elusive cup of coffee house quality coffee at long last it has arrived in the form of the flavia fusion ! this is the easiest quickest most delicious cup of home brewed coffee or tea you will ever make the unit does have a large footprint but it definitely fits on the counter without taking up too much room if you have an average sized kitchen or larger set up is simple remove from box insert the filter fill it with water and plug it in thats it once you prime '' the system pressing two buttons on the top while simultaneously flipping the power switch you 're ready to go insert the beverage packet adjust the height to accommodate your drinking vessel push the button and voila ! since the water is preheated you get a hot delicious beverage of choice in 30 seconds if you get the medley '' pack value 29.99 you also get a free travel mug contrary so what some reviewers have said it does fit in the unit when you remove the drip tray the medley pack is a nice extra as it gives you the opportunity to taste test every flavor being investing in a large purchase and finding out you do n't like it the creamy topping '' is a must have for any special indulgence '' drinks you want a necessity for the exotic chai if you want it to taste just like starbucks which it does this is a fantastic time saver in the morning and when you have guests its terrific to be able to make a different flavor for each person as for clean up there are two '' what cleanup '' you take the package out of the machine and throw it in the garbage simple as that no more filters to buy no more pots to descale no more throwing out half of the pot that you did n't drink just amazing
this machine is wonderful ! i first tried flavia coffee a couple of years ago while waiting for my car to be serviced at the mercedes dealership best coffee i 'd had in a long time it 's so nice to walk into the kitchen insert a packet and push a button for a cup of hot whatever i feel like ! this machine deserves a five rating in the ease of use and the flavor of the packets whether they are teas coffee or chocolate i would recommend this to anyone
i love this machine each package is its own brewing system that means that there is nothing to clean nothing to clog and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other i love strong coffee and i found even the house brand to be full flavored most surprising is how good the teas taste you actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea the herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor the only disappointment was the hot chocolate it was basically just as good as swiss miss the frothing packages do work but i get just as good if not better from skim milk and a 2 gizmo from ikea they are nice to keep on hand the milky way froth does give a nice caramel flavor the big down side is you can only get refills from flavia they have recently started giving free shipping on orders over 100 so stock up and get the free shipping my big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir i have accidentially run out of water more than once the machine does 'spit ' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup
i have the black fusion in my home office which is next to a theater room and my wife and i already love this machine we have tried all sorts of mixes and we 've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do this is one of the first times i 've been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it physical properties it handles travel mugs if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway and all our standard '' mugs the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks more common with frothy '' drinks than coffee and tea when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it the water tank could be larger if only because we 're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long but if you have a ready source of water nearby it should n't be a problem the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo which we also have it 's made by m so you can bet that the sweeter drinks the indulgence fare is excellent coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast '' and sumatra '' lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column the colored portion after any particularly splashy '' drinks no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug of course you ca n't watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you 'll probably get a drip here and there final bits we 've had the senseo since its launch between pods that need '' to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and indulgence '' mixes every day with the flavia and it 's to use certainly easier to clean up after too ! if you 're on the fence between the flavia and other offerings like senseo get the flavia keurig and other offerings ca n't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia i 'm sipping a tea blend now made over ice and it 's fantastic highly recommended
granted it is a bit noisy at first more like a shocking sound not so much noisy but you get used to it the mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill especially if you 've never used any of the larger office machines this was a complete first for me i mixed a few watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes but i got the hang of it and love it i commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at 2 to 3 a cup so there 's a huge savings in this product and the tea is the best i 've ever had they actually add juice concentrates in the pack some selections so the tea is very flavorable the machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter but i think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home it will always stick out at first i bought black and it looks great there really is n't any cleanup at all other machines i looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons this really is so simple finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter because the packs are bigger than most pods it is a challenge i ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry the round display rack that flavia offers looks pretty neat i will definately buy that over all it 's a perfect product in my opinion
only problem i have with it is that the plug does n't go all the way into the power which seems a little bit unsafe but works grea
it was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than do n't fit although the bottom feet which you do have to assemble had to be forced in order to fit it 's also quite attractive i should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is it 's nice to see real wood but i am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff ikea sells is more environmentally friendly finally you ca n't beat the price
this is functional yet very nice to look at and is extremely easy to put together it holds alot of dvd 's or cd 's and looks nice with any deco
this is my third mission collection item and it lives up to the other two you ca n't go wrong with this collection i use it for picture frames on a small wall that seemed too empty it took nothing to assemble and is great looking ! highly recommended
we have one like a couple other reviewers here in the dark color we 've had it for probably a couple of years we love it ! with our dvd collection we went back to target to get another one and now all they have is natural ca n't seem to find the dark wood one anywhere online either can anyone help ! ps i checked ebay too with no luck i 'm guessing nobody 's selling theirs because they love it so much
i have one in a dark color i ca n't find anymore anywhere anyone know if they stopped making the other color
i think this item is a great buy well designed and very functional although i use it for my dvd 's instead of cd 's however my dvd collection has extended beyond the capacity for one tower so i 'm seeking to buy another but i wanted another dark walnut tower since the rest of my book shelves and my dvd tower i 've gotten from amazon are also in this color is there any way of finding this item in dark walnut
for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd then one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box no display it is exactly what i had been looking for slapped on the two foot ends and done ! perfect fit for dvds 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases like the ones new line cinema puts out you can fit more i do n't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot i have many oversized ones the hardwood is great too just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then it is worth it i am almost ready to buy a third one soon
i bought this steam vac a few weeks ago and have used it 4 or 5 times already on different areas of my carpeting i had little problem putting it together and have had no problems with leaks and i am known to be mechanically challenged i was most mystified by hooking up the hose and stair attachment but even managed that without great angst i followed instructions by first using my regular vacuum over the area that i was going to clean then i used the steam vac and the results were amazing the steam vac did a good job on the areas where my elderly dog had peed a few times over the past six months and the rest of the carpeting looks great after using this machine since the carpeting was last professionally cleaned oct 2005 i cleaned some areas twice i could not believe how much yucky dirty water kept coming out of the carpeting also the attachment that i used on the stairs brought up an amazing amount of dog i had just vacuumed the stairs with my hoover windtunnel it 's true that the tanks do n't hold alot of water i had to fill the tanks 2 or 3 times to adequately clean a area on the other hand if the tanks held any more water the machine would have been too heavy for me to easily use also per other reviewers i boiled water to fill about half the tank then filled it the rest of the way with really hot water from the sink maybe that helped to get such good results i was most amazed how quickly my carpeting in many places withhin a few hours last year it took several days for all of my carpeting to completely dry after being professionally cleaned quite frankly i think that the carpet looks just as nice now after i cleaned it myself i could n't be happier with my purchase
the hoover is my first steam cleaner it got my carpets cleaner than the model i rented from giant and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years i did have problems when i tried to use the attachments water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected might be user error i will have to look for better instructions
we have owned other hoover steam cleaners they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet we bought the hoover based on the reviews i was confident that it would n't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack i could n't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job ok our hoover came my husband put it together and it leaked all over i then the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them by then we had already taken it to the repair center after a week they had not touched it my husband picked the machine up and brought it home we decided to start from square one and put it together again he did following the directions to the letter lo and behold no leaks ! ! ! ! ! yeah ! my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman so the moral to this story is always read the directions first
works very well you 'll probably want to the carpet and also boil the water to get it extra hot if the hot water out of your tap is n't that hot once you do that it works extrememly well
i have a 9 ' x 12 ' area rug in my living room from pottery barn with 2 cats a dog and a old daughter vacuuming was just not enough this carpet was also beginning to smell like my dog after a big rain yuk ! my husband was convinced that we should throw this carpet away boy do i wish i took before and after pictures ! immediately after the first swipe i saw something magical there was my beautiful carpet again ! aside from working wonderfully it was easy to assemble and use of course i would have loved a bigger water tank i changed the water once on my ' carpet but that 's really fine also be sure to read the instructions an area rug like mine should have plastic placed underneath of it to protect the hardwood floor while shampooing i just took a few garbage bags cut them and opened them up and it was also a great deal sears had similar models for 100 more next i will buy the hardwood floor cleaner and scrub my floors with it
after having read the positive comments i purchased the from amazon and it was delivered this week i tried it today and i 'm very pleased with the results even though my den just needed to be refreshed '' i was amazed to see how dirty the water was i had brought home a bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the amazon comments were very negative so i returned it the only negative comment would be that the writeup in amazon is not correct there was no bare floor attachment in the box i had to order one from the hoover store but that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine
i have really messy children at the begining i thought about renting a carpet cleaner cause my carpets became very dirty i thought that nothing will clean them exept a commercial carpet cleaner but when i decided to start poty training them i found that i have to own one at home it 's really great it cleaned my carpets it 's easy to use it 's light i use it all the time for the usual old accidents the new potty ones
i rented the rug doctor to clean my area rugs on memorial day weekend and by july weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years i think it was due to the soap although i rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after i used the rug doctor soap i was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because i was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again this machine is easy to use i had absolutely no problems with leaking i did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet i used two scoops of oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses no problems whatsover my carpets got so very clean it extracts very well also my rugs dried fast i am so happy that i purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at amazon
my carpets feel and look brand new after using the steamvac ! i love how soft it feels so i have been using the steamvac at least every weeks the suction is great and my carpets dry super fast i agree with the other reviews not to use more than half of the solution that is called for
after years of renting rug doctors we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner we were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our carpets when they come in from playing also one of them is a puppy who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times after reading other reviews we selected the hoover we wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner the carpets are as clean as with a bigger rug doctor we have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time we are very happy with our hoover it is fairly light easy to fill and empty and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes as other people have commented the attachment hose tends to fall off so we just leave it off otherwise it 's a heck of a deal !
my three year old hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush she gets persistent dandruff and furballs but wo n't let me touch her with any other brush i have tried about every kind of brush but she hates being groomed ! so imagine my surprise when i pull this brush out of the package and she actually lays down for me to groom her after a few strokes ! the only downsides to this product are 1. the small size it does n't hold much fur so either all the fur ends up on the floor or you are emptying it every few strokes 2. the front '' versus back '' positions cats do not generally stay in one place i have three and they roll and walk around while i groom them it was a bit unconvenient to constantly switch the brush from my left to right hand to get the proper angle to my kitties i do n't know how this could be improved but it is a downside to the product overall it 's defineitely worth the 10 bucks i spent my never lets me groom her with anything else
i just received this product today and i already love it i ordered it for my cats it works as great as they said it would
i have a long haired ragdoll cat he is a constant shedder my husband saw this and bought it for me my cat hates being brushed so that is the challenge but when i do it you can see the difference i end up with a pile of fur and a much shinier cat he does n't seem to like it but he will escape for any brushing so i think that 's just him having to go only one direction is a bit hard because the cat is so stubborn but i can see the difference around my house i used to have to clean the furniture daily with a roller and now it is every few days days and no where near the amount of hair that used to get on there ! i recommend this for any long haired animal !
this bookcase was fast and easy to set up and it fits perfectly in the small space i have for it the one thing i would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves but that 's not a problem if you actually put books on this bookcase
i love this bookcase my only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split a bit but it still fit together so i kept it excuse the rhymes please it 's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books including some big heavy hardcovers 20 dvds 3 dvd box sets 12 videotapes and a few pictures and knicknacks and yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom best part the ease with which you can put it together i have ms so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal highly recommended
this mission folding bookcase is simply the best although i wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about 5 minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed
my husband and i purchased this shelf as a place to put my rather large collection of cookbooks we received the shelf within days of placing our order upon opening it took me maybe minutes to take it from completely packaged to set up we liked it so much after a month we purchased a second one we had the same positive experience with the second one the shelf is attractive as well as sturdy and affordable !
the product came in a timely manner it was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly i 'm glad i purchased it
it was great and easy to install enough shelves for my stuffs well it met my expectation
i have bought 2 of these bookcases they are very well made set up in 2 minutes forget the pressed wood bookcases i have they sag and fall apart not these bookcases they are solid wood the real thing and best of all there is no assembly required just unfold where you want it and start filling it up ! also very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again excellent buy for the price not made in china i think it is made in vietnam
i bought 3 of these they are a great addition to my natural pc table and 2 bookcases that i already had the price is great too
i have had this product for over a year and the bulb just burned out no cord problems ever i use it every night in bed and it does not disturb my husband i have never had any problem with it it looks like from the other reviews that maybe i just got lucky or it 's just that i have taken good care of it and never dropped it ! if i dropped it i would expect that it would break i would highly recommend this product
i am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product i purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and ac adapter about 5 years ago and i am still using it i replaced the light bulb for the first time replacement comes in the set i bought last year when it started flickering and died the book light has been used a great deal and i have accidently left it on for full nights before i am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage this is the only down side i can think of the battery pack has its advantages you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive i prefer using the ac adapter this might be why i never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time it fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks you can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want over the last year my boyfriend has bought at least 3 led booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them he has been stealing my booklight to read with and i am force to use the poor night stand lighting the funny thing is i had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a led book light now i am on this page again to buy another one for myself
i have owned one of these little wonders for over five years during that time i have replaced the lightbulb one time which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required for people who are complaining that the light feels flimsy '' have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light it 's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose imagine that ! it 's a moving part ! seriously maybe they 've switched to a different supplier although i doubt it but my light is a joy it has proven durable over countless trips moves and drops it provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you plus unlike so many designs on the market it is very lightweight some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read i just do n't understand all the negative reviews of this product the only thing i can suggest is try tightening those screws periodically it will make a world of difference
okay i have n't used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it 's great ! the light is n't good for areas that are adequately so do n't bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page s that you need to view it 's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it 's a bit pricey for what you get but it 's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i ca n't offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this '' now my thoughts are why did n't i ever think to buy this before
i found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate it 's a soft light almost seems like a natural spectrum and is very directed at the page the clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover and the neck is flexible as needed so functionally it gets a solid but i was n't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries two of those round batteries replacing them is a hassle though inexpensive because i have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before i leave and i have to find them in a store with an electronic department i wish this light took aaa or something the light does include batteries so you wo n't need to worry until you run out for me that was probably around 20 hours or so
very nice and handy product i whish the light was little bit more and brighter
i purchased one of these for my elderly mother it is very easy to use and works just as advertised ! the only problem we have had with it so far is once when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim i would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener
got tired of can openers that left little burrs '' or that were difficult to get started hesitant about buying a as seen on tv '' product but went for it works well amuses my toddler and the dogs overall happy with product hope it lasts
we are very pleased with this item and tried to purchase another just like it but you were out of them at the time
as a tea lover for 30 years i have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of and performance i 've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it 's still working perfectly it boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while
my only reservation is for safety sake it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet
and we 'll all have tea ! that is exactly what this was meant to do my wife likes to enjoy a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate when we are busy working outside in my garage workshop or doing what seems to be never ending yardwork this is the perfect outdoor electric kettle to have on hand we do n't have to worry that it might break like a glass carafe would and we do n't have to worry about turning it off i just fill it up put in on the tool bench plug it in and wait for it to do its thing ! all we have to do is sit down on the patio admire mother nature and enjoy a good hot cup of tea !
this kettle is amazing it 's simple you plug it in and flip the switch a light turns on to let you know it 's working it heats very quickly 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea it heats in about 3. for students in dorms you can use it for oatmeal soup tea automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute so no worries about fire hazards great product i use it every day
i love and and bought one for my parents as well as my in laws for my morning tea favorite feature is the auto shut off i can flip the switch get ready for work and water is ready to pour i do n't have to worry about running to the kettle once the water has boiled i highly recommend this product
great little gadget for heating water i do n't have to monitor it since it has an auto off the water is steaming hot great for a tea drinker like me great price too ! i bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms i have been using it at home so far i am going to give it a spin travel this thanksgiving unbeatable for the 10 i paid for it
the kittle looks good and i tried it was not very fast but was accepted
this electric kettle is awesome it boil water in no find any better one with this price !
it 's great for the price so far so good heats water fast light weight
i purchased this center for my son when he was only 3. he has a 13 '' and an original nintendo system with lots of games i thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic easy to put together or move and holds everything i needed it to this item is not something an adult would want to have in living area like one of the reviews i read i mean is a company that makes a lot of products for kids anyway my son loves this product and so does his 2 year old brother
i bought this video center for my son for christmas as well a to store and at first i did not think that it would fit in the drawer part but it did but the games do not fit on the top left and right slots because of the length of the games however they do fit on the sides where you would put the vhs tapes and that is where my son has added his games so you would have to be a little creative with it i had seen a review where a lady had bought this item for her son and she was very disappointed once she could not place the games in the slots and stated not to purchase everyone out there ! do not listen to that its a must have and it does help with organizing your room area ! and the price at the time during the holiday season i could not resist for 71.99 plus free shipping ! wow !
we thought this was very handy storage it holds all our video equiptment just right
this looks like a great organizer but with you people that have a game cube and a dvd player you can buy cd cases that music cds come in and place the xbox and game cube games in those along with the dvds it would be a bit of money depending on how many games and dvds you have
this was a one on one replacement for an original that lasted over 10 years the product works well and our experience lasts a long time
i bought the toaster because consumer reports said that it was the best buy and they recommended it i also did a search for the best buy and found it at i used it for the first time this morning and am very pleased with the product that i bought
this toaster works great for me but then it is just toast this particular toaster was given a good rating by consumer reports so i bought it it works just fine for me but how hard can it be to screw up toast enjoy
great toaster consumer reports online 2006 gave it a great rating i also have a krups top rated toaster and they both do a fine job both recommended this one was given to a family member as we do n't need two toasters the recipient upon seeing said wow ! that 's red ! ''
i love my kitchenaid toaster it is the best i have had and i have had a lot of brands throught he years it is tall and has wide slots to hold bread of every height and width the heat adjustments are easy to use and i love the bagel function for bagels english muffins etc i love the removable crumb tray too that makes it easy to keep clean i love it i am very glad i bought it
i originally placed an order with etronics through amazon but after 2 wks and the product had still not been sent i cancelled the item to date which is i still have not received a full i purchased this item at sears and it is the best of the best in this product that marketplace has on amazon is a sore spot with like i stated 2 weeks after payment and the item was still not even sent out and then i am informed it wo n't be received before christmas and i never received my 12.93 back from the seller so when all else fails you go to a store and you purchase it for the same amount and i know that was but be leary of this company because they ignore all of your emails and then they do n't refund your money in i am still trying to get my money back
the look is shiny and retro and it stands out in my friends ' kitchen works well the bagel and warming functions are much appreciated
no matter the number of napkins this holder adjusts to hold them neatly and you can even fold down one side so that it becomes an l shape to hold a large stack it looks nice on the table too
my husband absolutely loves this tie rack it 's classy and functions perfectly ties are easy to hang and do n't slip off in his cluttered closet
i bought this tie rack for my husband he previously used an electric rotating tie rack the product looks and is exactly as described but you have to lift up the top ties to get to ties on lower rungs so it is a little awkward however for the price it is a good deal also the ties do not fall off like they would on a coat hanger
my husband has so many ties and he was hanging them all on different hangers and they would fall all over the place and he could never find the one he wanted so i got online to find him a simple rack to keep all his ties in one place but i did n't need anything with lights or a motor to rotate it this has been simple meets the purpose he can now keep all his ties in one place and they do n't fall off ! now i can use all the hangers this tie rack frees up
this friction tie rack which holds 24 ties is simply the best ! ! ! purchased six of these to share with friends you wo n't be disappointed ! stylish functional it works and works well ! ! !
this little thing works great i already owned a circular tie holder but over the years i had accumulated so many ties that they started falling off i read the reviews and decided to buy this one to help me organize my ties i was very pleased with it in fact i 'm buying a second one and plan to get rid of the circular tie rack since this one works so much better
this is very easy to use and it makes everything very easy to clean so you would n't think it taste so great being a pod but it works great taste great and creates a nice little cream the machine i am using is a gaggia 97001 coffee deluxe espresso machine with automatic milk frother silver if you like strong espresso you will love this
i 've had this set for about 4 months now and so far they are n't too bad i really like the color i looked everywhere for blue to match my pattern i 'd say they are worth the money if you do a lot of cooking that calls for a heavy '' saucepan these are n't for you i like to make candy around christmas and these did n't work well for that i also found that when i boil water in them they still have marks on the bottom afterwards no matter how hard i scrub maybe that is just part of the seasoning process though
great size which stores several loaves of bread or bagels cutting board gets stuck sometimes
very nice bread bin ! i was pleasantly surprised that the stainless steel bread bin matched my cuisinart items coffee maker toaster oven perfectly the finish is a brushed stainless rather than shiny '' stainless it looks very nice on my counter top much nicer than the old bread basket with bread hanging out everywhere it 's also very roomy i also like the cutting board as i 'm forever digging under my kitchen cabits for a cutting board !
the box is quite attractive and the cutting board is thick and heavy which helps weight down the box itself which is made of rather thin metal this is a step above the 30 range polder boxes that do n't have the bread board i use a plastic cutting sheet over the bread board to keep it in good condition and am quite happy with the overall quality and the fit and finish it looks nice sitting on the counter i got the box primarily to keep my lab mix out of the bread products and so far it is working for that
i bought this pitcher for the pleasure i get just by looking at it when i was little my grandma had one in her kitchen that i would stare at during meals as i age this memories are important to me of course quality is great and it does n't drible got the scarlet because of it 's more contemporary look take a look at my customer image above and check how pretty this piece is i 'm sure you 'll get one too
no wonder fiesta wins so many design awards this pitcher delighted the receiver and me as well
i bought this to give as a gift but i had to admire it for a few days prior to wrapping i just love fiesta all the colors and shapes are wonderful the pitcher came fast and in perfect condition
it does function well hmmmmm kinda like a pitcher and looks great as an accent with my black appliances
i actually have several of these pitchers and love them all the handle is well balanced and it is an attractive item to set on the table
i started my fiestaware collection in november of 2002 when i was first introduced to it i started my collection with a sunflower and persimmon disk pitcher and a persimmon teapot to complement the colors of my casual dishes but after seeing how beautiful and durable fiestaware is it became a collection that is being enjoyed and used every single day i now have a lot of the serving pieces plus 30 place settings 2 sets of each in 15 different colors i love them once you get hooked on fiestaware it is hard to stop especially when they keep coming out with these new beautiful colors
i decided to add this pitcher to my sea mist collection since fiestaware is discontinuing the color much to my dismay i was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is sea mist is much more beautiful in person and so is the pitcher it not only matches my other fiestaware pieces but is an item that i can use in any room of the house i can see it displayed on the mantle in a bedroom the bathroom as well as the kitchen if only fiestaware would continue sea mist could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display
as a longtime collector of homer laughlin 's fiesta i can say this pitcher might be the apex of design it is form and function beautiful and sturdy the colors never fade and you never have to worry about a chip the range of colors is outstanding i have one of these in every color except black black to me was never a good fiesta color and i use them all great at parties to have lined up in a row with different drinks in each pitcher i use fiesta exclusively on my table at home and always get compliments
i had n't used amazon before and did so at the suggestion of my sister amazon had the products that i wanted at good prices and the ordering process was easy i did have the need to return an item due to an error on my part i followed the return procedure and it went smoothly without a hitch very convenient
and when it came up on my gold box offers i could n't resist ! and it is great ! ! heavy duty without feeling too heavy this pitcher makes any occasion a bit more special ! ! and it looks great in my yellow kitchen to boot ! ! stylish slightly retro and looks beautiful ! what more could you ask
the mario batali lasagna pan is the best pan i 've used it is extra deep so it holds really thick layers of all the good stuff i make my lasagnas with it weighs a ton since it is enameled cast iron but that is why it cooks so evenly i recommend adding about minutes of extra cooking time to your recipes because the oven does have to heat the heavy mass of the pan cleaning was easy just soak it in hot sudsy water for a while then all the baked on cheese and sauce will wipe off with a kitchen scrub pad the only surprises were that the rim of the pan has no enamel it is bare iron but it cleaned without a problem and did not rust when soaked overnight this is a great pan but it is very heavy when empty and even heavier when filled with a lasagna so make sure you 've got some stong helpers around to put it in the oven if necessary o
with a fairly intensive effort on my part in the hint '' department this was a christmas present it is one of those presents that you really actually like the more you use it i like it a lot i 've made five or six lasagnas so far and a few dishes like manicotti all of them were cooked evenly and it behaves like a '' tonight i made a nice lasagna that brought it up almost to the top with no overflow it is '' deep from the inside bottom to the top edge compare this to 2 '' for your standard pyrex 3 qt dish it cleans easily has a nice color and a nice finish it still looks brand new
spent over 80 bucks for the lovely lasagna pan yes it 's heavy but it 's a wonderful pan i found it very irritating that the free recipe book did n't include whole '' recipes within the recipes it says things like 2 cups basic tomato sauce then see pg 71 of molto italiano cookbook '' well i do n't own that cookbook and i certainly think they could have printed the entire recipe otherwise what good is it
this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i 'm really glad to add this to my pantry
i used the new pan today to high heat roast a 4 pound rib roast at 500 degrees the oven and pan were a mess but the pan deglazed beautifully with wine and 3 hours later with no soaking cleaned up with little effort it still looks brand new now if only my oven did the pan is really nice for the money the only surprise is that it is very burnt orange in color on my monitor i could n't tell the exact color and was hoping it would be more like le creuset 's flame but it is not muted and wonderful for autumn serving but definitely orange of course i did use it for a holiday party tonight but i did n't serve in it i bought the dutch oven too with the total being 139 with the free shipping my roast turned out great bt
big enough deep enough for heavy duty one you will love it
this is a great looking pan with good proportions it is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna it is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done i have made many other things in this pan with great results it is fairly and has not stained even after several lasagnas the enamel is fairly bulletproof overall i really like this pan with its only weakness being heft however that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table you wo n't be disappointed
works great the doser is kind of a pain sometimes but totally manageable it does a great job on the grinding and that is why i bought it bought this with the gaggia carezza and together they make great espresso
i recently reviewed the gaggia espresso maker i bought when i got this grinder and mentioned the grinder in that review my views on this grinder are simple buy it if you are the type that is because this grinder requires it you need to be right there watching tamping the beans especially if they are oily but usually even if they are not into the unit making sure the grind goes into the pockets inside the catcher and all that the entire time much like the espresso maker itself it does what it 's supposed to do and does it well but for 200 i would prefer a more automated process
i bought this grinder a year ago and we use it everyday sometimes multiple times a day it produces a consistent grind is very easy to change from an espresso setting to a coarser setting for drip coffee dosing takes practice as you have to think about how long the grind has been running to know how much you 've produced i highly recommend this product i fully expect it to last many years the only complaint i have about it is the area that holds the puck is too close to the doser
i 've had this grinder for over two decades and it has performed well when i first got my machine i wondered which setting number would be good for cappuccino or any particular grind the manual said that since coffee can vary from variety to variety or even from one roast to another it 's a matter of adjusting to each batch of beans perhaps with 34 settings people have found that to be helpful but i have found my beans to be consistent enough that adjustments are necessary for type of coffee but can be left alone for a particular type of coffee and a particular variety of beans from a source at the time i got the machine i got my beans from peet 's back when they had five stores and no other distribution channels although they are a larger chain now they are still small enough that roasting can be well controlled and they can still buy beans from a single source for a variety to meet the needs of the chain for beans from other sources where roasting is done at a variety of locations or from beans from differing sources you might need to pay more attention to adjustments a much bigger issue that affects strength and everything else is the dosing from reading the other reviews it does not seem to have changed since i got my unit the top of the unit can be filled with beans and the part over the dispensing area will fill up with a remarkably consistent grind that round area is divided into six sections like a wheel with spokes five of the sections get filled with grounds one section is empty and is above the dispenser each time the lever is pulled the wheel rotates one position clockwise and one section gets dispensed through the empty section in theory if the unit were full the amount of coffee in each section would be consistent chances are that in real life you would not want to fill the unit up for home use since the grounds would not be fresh by the time you use them if you grind just enough for a few cups then the coffee will not end up in the compartments evenly and dosing by counting pulls will not work if you lift the lower lid you can see where the coffee is and you will likely see a small mound in the back and partly filled areas toward the front if you grind smaller amounts you could redistribute things with a brush but even that way some areas would end up more compacted than others or you could merely gain the experience to know how much was dispensed compared to how much you need and pull the handle accordingly another option is to gring with the lower lid off as you watch grinds fall into the compartment you can rotate as each compartment gets filled dispensing as you go along then you can become consistent once you develop a good eye for it whether you want to consider the dispenser poorly designed is a matter of perspective if you believe that this unit was designed to grind beans for two cups of coffee then it would be a fair conclusion if you believe that this unit was designed for people who prepare cups an hour you might think that it 's just fine if you believe that it was designed for a higher level of fairly constant use you would probably not be disappointed but since this unit is most likely for home users it 's hard to claim that the dispenser is ideally suited to the task experience will let you know how high the grounds are supposed to be when you put them in the filter basket and it 's not going to take you long to learn while this unit is not fool proof chances are that you are not a fool so things will work out for me the bottom line is that once you know the correct grind setting for your beans the unit is more set it and forget it '' than what the instructions said at least with consistent beans but the dispenser is a lot less set it and forget it '' than what the literature implies personally i prefer a unit that takes the guess work out of getting the grinds to be the right consistency since it 's easy to get the amount dispensed right by eyeballing it this unit does very well in that respect i use this in conjunction with a gaggia coffee now known as gaggia classic the new gaggia coffee is a different machine and the two make a good pair learning how much coffee to dispense is a minor part compared to learning how long to hold the switch on the espresso machine or how to froth milk perfectly but ultimately it boils down to knowing how to make a proper espresso if you can tell when to stop the water based on the color of the coffee coming out then a bit more or less from the grinder will affect how full the cup gets rather than the taste of your brew you ca n't automate a perfect espresso but you can use the correct tools to allow you to make one with experience
bought this to use with my rancilio it seems to have made a huge difference i thought there was something wrong with the espresso maker as my espresso was always flat and thin tasting freshly ground beans is the way to go vast improvement over preground espresso illy 's or lavazza i would have given it 4.5 stars the only thing holdng it back is the silly doser either i 'm not using it right or its just not well designed but everything else makes this a worthwhile purchase to those coffee freaks who can afford it i used the free shipping and 25 off deal thanks threefires
its amazingly quiet considering whats happening to those poor little beans it gives me just the grade of grind i need for my espresso machine to get a perfect shot but it gets a 4 rather than 5 because there were no pads on the base i think they may have been missing or maybe they just do n't provide them even though there is a place for
i got this to accompany my gaggia 35005 carezza because had been having inconsistent results with blade grinders and store bought was n't doing it for me this thing makes a difference it 's incredible for that particular espresso machine i found that a grind setting of 9 works great the problems are the doser does n't actually neatly dose anything sometimes i have to hit it 5 times sometimes 3 puzzling you can eye it but the thing only appears to work if you grind a bunch of beans and make more than one drink first drink it takes a few pulls to get the grounds to the front for the doser also there 's no neat way to only grind what you need to use looks like some experimentation and another timer will be required another issue is it looks like you have to actually disassemble it which is not a simple task to clean it thoroughly or really even at all overall it 's quiet creates perfect grounds has a of settings although i can only see myself using two one for coffee one for espresso but the doser is garbage i might have opted for a cheaper model knowing this but my lattes are perfect now
my elderly kitty had orthopedic surgery on his right knee in feb and a month later he was still in pain and walking very gingerly our local vet suggested nutramax cosequin for cats and within four days there was an absolutely dramatic change for the better moses stopped growling crying and biting his tail he began walking around the bedroom in which he was confined for safety his appetite improved and he enjoyed grooming once again he has continued his progress and his walk is and appears painless he sleeps well is as active as his surgeon allows and we are very thankful to have found this product my fiancee believes that glucosamine and chondroitin enabled him to postpone his knee surgery for nearly ten years so he was not as surprised as i about our kitty 's improvement pain and arthritis control is so difficult in cats please speak to your vet and consider trying this product open the capsules and sprinkle into about a tablespoonful of food and mix it in our little likes it just fine ! then offer any other food your cat might like cosequin certainly reduced and has nearly ended any visible suffering for our precious little guy thanks nutramax r
the product came quickly and seems to really be helping our 15 year old cat she 'd been limping pretty badly beforehand and is walking much more easily now the capsules are easy to sprinkle on her food and she gobbles it right down i 've just ordered a hefty supply to continue with the supplement regimen
my maine coon has arthritis in his paws his paws get quite swollen with the cosequin the swelling has noticeably improved and he is n't limping ! he is n't running but he is walking better
this product worked great for our 17 year old cat due to his increasing arthritis we were concerned that we were going to have to put him to sleep soon to put him out of his misery after being on this 2.5 months he is back to normal he still moves slow but he 's not in pain and you would move slow too if you were years old ! we highly recommend this
i 've used this product before it 's easy to sprinkle on catfood difficult to tell how effective it is but the cat gets around
this is a great product and has really helped our 9 year old cat who weighs in at about 14 pounds he started limping a while ago and was n't up to playing very much he started to put on more pounds which put us in a situation we started giving him the cosequin and it really helped he is now and plays a lot more he really likes the flavor and has no problem eating it at all i 'm thrilled with the price also because our vet was charging us 45 for the same package of capsules ! thanks for a great product
we 've been using cosequin for about a year for our cat he 'd been showing signs of pain that the vet said was most likely arthritis and suggested trying cosequin i noticed within a few weeks a vast improvment and i 've been using it since i paid much more at the vets than i did online recently i ran out and did n't get around to buying more for a few weeks and my cat started having pain again he 's back on it now and i wo n't let that happen again
my cat is almost 17 years old and has developed arthritis in his knees prior to cosequin he was limping any time he walked and was in obvious pain he only limps now when he first wakes up but who does n't getting old is a bitch anyway it 's a great product and way cheaper through amazon than from the vet
this heats perfectly evenly cooks wonderfully looks great and i believe you could burn glue in this pan and it would wash out with cold water and a couple of swishes with a brush the which is not teflon covers the inside and outside of the pan except for the very bottom that sits on the heating element so you do n't have drips burning onto the side that wo n't come off and absolutely nothing sticks to this stuff i cook almost everything without oil or fats of any kind and i have used one of these pans hundreds of times to brown onions sear meat melt and burn cheese and even fry '' eggs with no oil nothing sticks and everything rinses right off the lids are tempered glass with a valve under the center handle that lets you let off the steam or keep the pot sealed the handles are very comfortable i think the pans and the lids look terrific even if they are n't highly polished stainless or chrome and how long does that high polish last two caveats both of which are in the instructions keep the heat below high on an electric the element should never glow red and make sure there are no traces of food on the pan before you use it again little smears that you do n't quite see when you 've just washed the pan but you can see when it 's completely dry can cook onto surface and reduce the effectiveness of the and can cause discoloration and you do n't need to cook over blazing burners like they do on the tv shows i get great results at moderate heat besides i do n't have a crew to clean my crusty pans when i 'm finished cooking like the tv chefs do
in my opinion these are the greatest pans available ! non stick without the worry goes into the dishwasher no problem i am replacing all my other pans with this brand
i have owned countless nonstick pans only to find that they peel after time scary with all the teflon toxicity reports and do n't conduct the heat well i now have a new gas stovetop with super high btu burners the nonsick i had could n't hold up to the heat i purchased the swiss diamond 12 '' and 10 '' frypans i am back to buy the 8 '' the swiss diamond heats evenly has a nice flat bottom and is very effective in the nonstick department it just loves the high heat of my burners and my husband loves it too so i get dinner cooked for me ! i highly recommend the swiss diamond nonstic
the swiss diamond fry pan is an outstanding fry pan it heats very evenly and cleans up well we bought it having used one at my neighbor 's house and were impressed with the pan
i found purchased this pan at the beginning of september when there was only one review for all of the pieces i wanted to use as a test pan before ordering more let me tell you this is definitely on my christmas list ! i am thoroughly impressed i have used this pan nearly daily sometimes twice daily since receiving it and it has performed flawlessly within the month my husband stacked knives forks spoons inside it then topped it off with 6 dinner plates i nearly had a heart attack ! my son had done that to a calphalon commercial nonstick fry pan i had to throw it in the trash i quickly unloaded it all the while chastising my husband for doing that to a nonstick i inspected it closely but could n't find one nick or scratch ! i was absolutely amazed ! i cooked bacon one day decided to use my rectangular iron bacon press in it i accidently scraped the sides a couple different times with no damage whatsoever another day i accidently left the empty pan on the burner at heat for well over 20 minutes the burner itself started to smoke but not the pan ! no warping or darkening of the finish i was sure then i had done it in but again i was wrong i must admit that i do n't use metal utensils in it although it states that you can i always use silicone mostly or nylon i also do n't put it into the dishwasher as i wo n't have one till the kitchen gets remodeled so have not tested it in these two aspects i must warn others that this pan takes a few minutes to heat up fully i heat it up on heat every time and then reduce the temperature to medium to i bacon the first time i used it due to failing to reduce the temperature now if they just made bakeware small appliances with this stuff on
this is absolutely the best cookware i have ever used ! i ca n't recommend it highly enoug
great product excellent suction easy to assemble easy to clean great rewind facility power brush was missing though
had it for a month now and it 's excellent ! paid 57 and it was a steal
have n't had the vac long but so far it has very good suction and light weight when using the cord rewind is a plus also
this vacuum works great and comes at an excellent price we use it on carpet and wood floors and it cleans pet hair really well the hand tools are also great for getting under furniture and in tight spaces highly recommended
i was looking for something to keep my apartment cleaned as i am a pretty big this was the perfect buy the automatic is a great feature although it was n't the feature that made me choose to purchase this model it is definitely something i 'm glad it has it 's not too loud nor too heavy it 's got a very easy to use bagless garbage collection bucket limits the amount of dust you put back onto your floor after cleaning it the first time i love this product and am super happy i got it and at such a great price
i searched around for a while for a reasonable priced vaccum i have only 1 real rug but man was it covered in dog hair i used to be able ot rake it off with my one sweep now that i have this vac there is almost none left even after a day or two of not vaccuming i am so happy i bought this vac
i ordered this item for a friend he was searching everywhere for a replacement for his present one that broke but could n't find it i finally found this dispenser on your website and ordered it for him and he was more than satisfied he said it was much better then the one that he was replacing
exactly as pictured looks great pumps work flawlessly i put in one and in the other i have used it for about a year now without problems
for all you people out there who have a hard time stopping a brita filter system from leaking just pop out the washer from the original aearator that you just unscrewed to install the brita in the first place and add it on top of the brita washer ! then just reinstall it ! it 's just that simple
now i can drink water and make tea coffee without the clorine tast
i just received mine this afternoon and it took my boyfriend less than 5 minutes to install and was so easy that i could have done it we notice the difference in the taste of our water already and are happy with the product i will definitely drink more tap water and throw away the pitcher now that we have this filter new york water tastes like a swimming pool and this makes drinking it so much better ! i highly recommend this brita filter system
the aquaview 42645 by britta was a snap to install and it is working with no problems so far
the brita aquaview system is the very good filter the water taste is really good only is too expensive ok thank
this was a perfect replacement for the 10 '' glass lid i accidentally broke and the seller shipped it via dhl instead of ups so it was delivered to my box with no pain or attempts to track down packages the price may seem a bit steep but the construction and materials are excellent thick stainless steel and a very firmly attached handle i 'm considering replacing all my glass lids with stainless steel i wo n't be able to see how things are cooking but at the same time i 'll never have to worry about breaking another lid
a fair price for this pan of this high quality even cooking with little or no oil very pleased
after reading other reviews on this skillet i orded it we love it it is so nice to cook on low heat and have the meat to brown i just heat the skillet up on med heat and put a chop in it cooks very slow and nice i do need to use any oil or breading i love this skillet
if you are going to buy only one pan this is the one it 's perfect for every use as far as size and depth and wipes clean ! a little on the heavy side but that 's the quality it 's made of the only thing missing is a lid but you can use one of thoses universal size lids for all pans for such a quality pan i would like to see a quality glass perfect fit lid other than that you ca n't find better
throw out the oil pam and butter this skillet is great eggs swedish pancakes tacos meeatballs everything slides right off with no charring and a great even cook best of all cleanup is a cinch i just use a soft wet sponge and everything wipes off without any stains or residue heck i even made some indian curry and you know how that stains well no problem with this skillet the pan is quite heavy which i like but not too heavy to still flip pancakes and eggs with one hand
works great ! it heats up fast and cleanup is a breeze have n't tried washing it in a dishwasher
great skillet there holds up well i cook with stainless usually but for i use anolon
i 'd been thinking about buying a blender for making smoothies milkshakes etc for ages but instead made do with the ordinary blenders made exclusively for the home in short those blenders have been utterly disappointing because they do n't crush ice feel too ' and never produce good drinks so after reading the glowing reviews for waring blenders i decided to take the plunge and buy one i bought the commercial bar blender with the stainless steel canister i guess i was worried that the traditional glass one might crack even if others insist that it wo n't it seems expensive but once you buy this you 'll be wondering why you ever settled for anything less ! it crushes ice like a dream and i can turn out superb drinks no lumps ! it 's extremely easy to use and so easy to clean i make breakfast smoothies every day now
my old belnder broke and it was hard to find a good one to substitute i actually had a very simple and cheap model but it seemed the old ones were better than the new models the jars were seemed not to be shaped right and there was always some food left over in chunks when i wanted all to be pureed after trying 2 other very good brands and having to return them i finally decided to try the waring and what a great blender it is ! somewhat noisy but i really do n't mind that when the appliance gets the job done my smoothies came out smoothier than ever and the pureed soups were velvety creamy definitely a 5 stars product and worth every penny spent on it !
my husband and i drink friut smoothies almost daily so i was looking for a blender that can withstand daily use we 've been through 2 previous blenders and the magic bullet but the waring professional blender is gets the job done it crushes the ice cubes and blends well in only a few seconds i love having only 2 speeds who needs to liquefy or puree anyway i also like having the stainless steel container no glass to break so far i 'm pleased with my purchase
i 've used this blender about 45 times mostly on frozen bananas with milk or yogurt it works some reviewers have had problems with splashing the instructions say to hold the lid down i turn the blender on with one hand and hold the lid down with my other hand the inside of the lid does get splashed i 've never had splashes come through the lid once the blender is running i let go of the lid open the little hole and drop frozen bananas into the hole while holding the outside lid tiny splashes come though the little hole which i ca n't see as unusual or problematic i 'm very happy
pulverizes ice but loud as a lawnmower waring 's best by far
great blender ! i use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails powerful motor purees frozen fruits great ! ! simple only two speeds easy
overall this is an excellent blender it 's well crafted and sturdy made of metal and glass i had a cheap hamilton beach in college and it just did n't cut it i had leakage all the time with the hb blender and the 9 million speeds it had were worthless as other reviewers here have said you only really need the waring 's low and high speeds that 's it seriously this blender has only a few pieces and it works so well i 've used it many times to make frozen drinks smoothies milkshakes etc people have also complained they 've had problems with ice if you fill the blender with the liquids soft foods etc on the bottom and add ice cubes little by little at the top it pulverizes the mixture like no other my girlfriend likes her drinks with little chunks of ice and i like them smooth the waring caters to us both it 's easy to clean if you follow the instructions think about this although it 's higher priced than other blenders out there it 's an investment do you want to keep the same kitchen appliance many times or do you want to buy it once there 's a reason why waring decided to bring back the classic beehive design that our grandparents used it 's because it works if you do n't believe me then look at the tight spiral that the class carafe and metal blades create with your drink just peer over the top of the unit while it 's on quite a show ! this blender is slick
so far so good with this blender my only gripe is that is does n't seem to crush all the ice there 's always a little piece left in the bottom i jiggle the container turn up the speed then back down but that ice sliver wo n't blend aside from that issue the blender is working well
this product should be labeled as a mr heater '' propane guage it does not measure the level of liquid propane in your tank however it does measure the ability of the vaporized flow of propane gas to keep up with the usage of your propane appliance the red yellow and green indicator disk on the circular dial makes it easy to see how your propane use is doing before you completely run out its debatable if you need to know exactly '' how much liquid propane is still in the tank the vaporization indicator on this guage has been useful for me
expensive yes ! worth definitely ! the set is amazingly good i 've tested drive the knifes against my existing knifes there is a grand canyon of difference ps the knife is great but it is not sold by amazon but be macy 's they do not offer the fast delivery options when buying through amazon and dealing with them is a pain in the neck would avoid macy 's at all costs their service is not even close to amazon 's the 5 stars are for the knife macy 's get a 0
the pieces i use the most in this set is the scissors cook 's knife paring bread and sharpening steel i can do without the other ones but i like the extra slots to add to my collection and it 's more expensive to collect them singly i used to think that all knives are created equal since i love cooking shows and top chef i always wanted to chop as fast as they do i used to watch fu chinese cooking shows when i was a little girl and she said that you can do it by curling your fingers in so the knife touches your knuckle i tried and tried and for fear of seing my bare white knuckles i just could n't do it then after i came here american chefs chop differently using a rocking motion i bought from costco a set of henckles international knives what i thought was high quality knives afterall they were a german brand henckles when i first got them i always had mysterious cuts on my other fingers but i thought it must be me then i tried to imitate the american chefs i tried and tried and for fear of loosing all my fingers i just could n't do it i thought i must have the technique wrong afterall they do it with such finesse well i finally gave in at my old age my expensive german knives turned out to be made in spain and are so dull that i can barely cut through chicken thighs even after sharpening so i finally got myself some righteous german knives first i did n't feel like spending a lot for the knives so i bought the cheaper wusthof gourmet set for half the price ha you get what you pay for the smaller knives are so thin i thought i could break it i returned it and got the creme de la creme '' ok almost there 's the shun wuesthof classic and the wuesthof santoku used by almost all the celebrity chefs on the food network now i know the secret to all those chefs who can chop so fast it 's not the technique it 's the knives
i 've been using these knives at home since i was a child my parents received their set as a wedding gift 35 years ago for the most part the knives are just now starting to show signs of wear mostly from poor care with a professional sharpening every few years and hand washing these knives will last a lifetime
i have this exact set and have had it for probably 6 years the knives stay super sharp and look almost new even after years of use you get what you pay for if you want to own a set of knives that you 'll only have to purchase once this would be it
i am a stage performer as well as a chef i specialize in contortion and throwing knives often with my feet i use the wusthof so much in the kitchen that i thought i would incorporate it into my act i throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants throwing knives are usually smaller perfectly balanced and forged from one solid piece they require perfect tang as well and incredible strength wusthof is the only kitchen knife that meets these requirements although i have several chef 's knives global henckel wusthof etc i prefer the wusthof both in the kitchen and on stage i would never bring the henckel or any other brand wusthof has absolutely perfect balance and tang the difference from throwing knives is that kitchen knives usually have handles added to the forged steel unlike any other brand wusthof 's handle is extremely durable in practice i broke all other brands of knife both handle and blade i was surprised that my henckels did not last very long the 6 '' pro 's blade snapped in half and 8 '' 's handle came apart on one side the quality of a wusthof really shows when you use it for something it 's not meant for and is still extremely reliable and as you can read in all the other reviews it is very sharp in case you 're wondering i 've never injured an assistant but i did slit my foot open one time i also stuck a head of lettuce to a vaulted ceiling
perfect little timer did not scare me when the alarm went off happy i bought it
i consider myself a serious aquarist with a setup that cost me over 3000 for my overly spoiled koi and fancy goldfish i recently moved from pennsylvania to new york city where the water quality is not nearly as friendly toward goldfish nor consistent coming out of the tap and so i find myself testing the water many times in between scheduled water changes from the tank as well as the faucet i ca n't stress enough how convenient it is to dip one of these strips and be done with all the testing in one shot but also consider that the liquid tests are not much more economical each strip costs around 0.20 and with 5 tests all done within about a minute even if you are doing the regular liquid ' for ph nitrate and nitrite those tests typically run at best 0.15 0.05 per test and you 're looking at a few minutes for each individually i personally got tired of rinsing the tubes and leaving them somewhere to dry but i would also gladly spend a penny per minute to not have to go through all that
the pop n cork pushes out the cork with a little wiggle i was a little reluctant to use it at first intimidated by pushing the needle into the cork but i now use it regularly it makes such a happy sound when the cork pops out it is certainly more expensive than mechanical openers and it does need replacement cartridges but it 's wow '' value is high and the dang thing just flat out works keep it far from children
i love this thing it is fast easy efficient and a blast to use it is surprising how easy it is and you can impress people since very few have ever seen anything like it press the needle through the cork all the way in press the end to release the gas and the cork pops out immediately sounding like a champagne bottle it really is quite the thing
these are great ! they look great and are heavy enough to feel sturdy yet functional even after wash after wash by hand and in the dishwasher they continue to work well and maintain their shine
i 've been a devoted cook for the past thirty years and i can truthfully say that this is the best nonstick skillet that i 've ever used it has a nice heft without being unduly heavy and has very even heat best of all cleanup could n't be easier this is the first swiss diamond product that i 've tried and i look forward to purchasing more
wow what a pan i have bought the 8 10 11 and 12.5 inch pans i love them i have recently and replaced my ultrex non stick with these pans waiting for the lids to the 11 and 12.5 inch ones so i can really start cooking ! i have heard so much about these pans and it is all true superb cooking ! ! omelets to die for they practically flip themwelves right out do n't let the light weight of this sturdy pan fool you it 's all about performance heats up evenly and does n't need very high heat at all i was almost tempted to just paper towel the pan but went ahead and hand washed with warm soapy water love it ! ! ! awesome i recieved the 12 '' it comes with a lid ! ! i used it to make panfry dumplings i have tried ultrex non stick and revere stainless neither with good results both did n't come close to swiss diamond little pricey but i will never have to buy another non stick pan again this one has a limited lifetime warranty limited to the fact i do n't cook commercially or abuse the pan even heating even on burner that is not as large as pan great browning and nothing sticks highly recommend !
we 've gone through a lot of pans in the last few years tried following all the instructions but they all end up with little pockmarks on the surface where the became unstuck and probably ended up stuck in our livers for all i know this swiss diamond pan seems to be genuinely you can even fry cheese in it and it will slide around on the surface it heats very evenly and does n't have to be treated with kid gloves you can use metal utensils if they were n't so expensive i 'd replace all our cookware with this the only caveat is we 've only had the thing for a month so i ca n't verify the surface will stay on but it sure looks robust
i love this product i bought 3 pieces about a month ago and it easily lives up to all its claims it looks good cleans very easily both inside and out the heat is incredible crack an egg onto the pan and you can see how perfectly uniform it cooks immediately ideal for omellettes the handles really do stay cool the bottom is perfectly flat and works well both with gas and ceramic electric meat browns well seems to do fine in the dishwasher although the manufacturer recommends against it in my house pans either survive the dishwasher or die but frankly it cleans so easily that the dishwasher is n't necessary i 've owned cast iron calphalon calphalon le crueset scan pan and a couple of others over the years and nothing compares to this product no scratches or flakes have n't tried it in the oven yet but ca n't imagine why it would n't work perfectly my only doubt is how long it will last all the other above mentioned cookware worked fine at first too i scratched up too many over the years this does n't really have a coating so that should n't be a problem so far it 's been worth every penney and i will probably buy more
you will not find a better pan than swiss diamond we 've had this for a few months and it still performs as brand new i 've never had a single thing stick on this cooking eggs etc everything just runs out also have used metal utensils on this and there are no marks people do n't believe me when i tell them about these pans they claim they have good non stick pans i thought we did too you do n't know until you use this pan
i have an entire set of swiss diamond in addition to this pan i bought swiss diamond because due to weak wrists i needed sturdy cookware that was not as heavy as stainless steel because aluminum is the primary affordable alternative and one does not want food coming in contact with aluminum because of the possible leaching of it into the food i sought pans with a coating that would not flake or scratch off and end up in my food after much research i discovered swiss diamond i have not been disappointed the pans are a great weight hefty without being too heavy and after several months of use the coating is holding up beautifully i confess that i do not primarily use metal utensils in it however so i ca n't testify about how they hold up against metal these pans caramelize food beautifully and the evenness of the heat distribution in them is a pure joy they do take a few extra seconds to heat up but hold heat very well i really love how flat the pan 's bottom is and imagine if you have a flush electric cooktop these would be especially appreciated though i have a gas range i had trouble in the past with pots and pans slipping and sliding on the enameled grates but these pans do not slide and i was delighted to discover after realizing i had accidentally left this pan on low heat for an hour with no food in it it did not warp at all and is still in perfect condition this cookware cleans up easily and perfectly too i love that they are coated on the outside walls of the pans so any dried or cooked on food comes off the outside as easily as the inside one thing to note is that if you are looking for a pan to cook eggs in without oil this may not be your best choice the texture of the diamond coating seems to grab more than a slick teflon pan would and the first time i tried to flip my fried eggs without a spatula i had less than stellar results but with sufficient oil i can flip the eggs without a spatula or a problem i need to make my daily quota of coconut oil anyway for health reasons so i 'm fine with putting oil in the pan if you use a spatula you should easily be able to flip eggs without oil i do hope these pans turn out to be durable over the years so far after a few months they are aces ! in fact my husband may be growing weary of my exclaiming i love this cookware ! '' over and over again
this is the exact replacement air filter and bracket for the older dust buster models check listing to make sure your model is listed if your dust buster is slow loses it 's charge quickly and does n't seem to work right it might be that the filter is clogged like mine was this seems to have fixed the problem
the filter makes me happy because it keeps my office from becoming dusty since this is the only filter you can buy for this product it does n't make sense for me to try to promote it or compare it as you have no choice however compared to other similar kinds of products this seems to do very well no dust flying out the side of the unit easy cleanup easy installation and removal just twist it into place and voila

i do a lot of baking and i have used my fair share of spatulas i can honestly say this spatula brand i purchased the same brand spatula in another size is the best i have every owned it is flexible enough at the tip to clear away batter from the sides of the bowl but firm enough through the body so that it remains flat against the bowl the best characteristic is its single construct form which means that no grow between the spatula head and the stick '' that usually goes inside and the entire spatula can be used at very high temps the entire body of this spatula is silicone therefore is easy just place in the dishwasher and you have a sterilized and fantastic spatula to use again and again i just wish i did n't waste all that space on other spatulas those spatulas that have a silicone head but a wooden body these just grow stuff inside the hole '' in the silicone head ! my advice do n't look any further for a spatula that will fit all of your baking needs
if you have a dishwasher this is the perfect dish drainer for you to have for ther every now and then when something is not dishwasher safe you still have a dish drainer but you are not using your counter space for it i love this item
these are n't the thickest towels i 've owned and they 're definitely not grand patricians but for the price they are a nice 'guest bath ' towel they have held up well to washing and i 've had no problems with colorfastness they are a towel at a walmart price
i bought these washcloths to fill in a set of towels i bought on amazon the same day the set i purchased came with two washcloths and i always like to have four so i can rotate them to keep them fresh these washcloths are fabulous very soft yet absorbant and large often washcloths are only 12 x 12 even expensive ones but these are 13 x 13 and have retained their shape and color through several washings i am very pleased with them
this is the second or third time i have purchased linens on line from amazon when i receive the merchandise it is always as expected although i have to pay shipping for me it is a convenience expense i live an hour away from a shopping center have an intense work schedule allowing little time for shopping in a conventional way this is a terrific way for me to buy what i want get the quality i expect and make the best use of my time
i just ordered two of these cloths on july 21 2006 thought i was getting 2 of the wash cloths when the package arrived it contained just 2 single wash cloths before purchasing these cloths i called amazon and the representative assured me that what i would be ordering is a she said look at the picture it appears to be 2 cloths and several of the reviews refer to do n't worry you will get 2 cloths in the pack '' when the cloths arrived there were 2 individually wrapped cloths and that completed my order i immediately called amazon and the very helpful representative agreed that the product description was vague and she agreed to credit my account for 1 of the wash cloths she also said she was putting in a request that description be changed to make it clear that you would receive only 1 wash cloth hope this helps anyone else confused about this
this product is great i was so tired of using other types of can openers and i 've tried them all with the electric ones the cans would slip off and splash water all over the table the manual ones also slip off and then i 'd have to saw the rest of the lid off with a steak knife both types leave a very sharp lid i 've cut my fingers many times the onetouch solves all the problems associated with opening cans you just place the one touch on top of the can press the button and the one touch does the rest this can opener even leaves a lip on the top of the lid so you can close the can fantastic !
this aaa battery powered device works just like the fancy ones you 'll find in upscale public bathrooms the switch works well assembly is a little confusing apparently you need to prime it but i was n't able to figure out this part without the fear of breaking it so i just filled it with soap and it worked fine that 's my only problem with it it would be nice if they provided a sticker with brief instructions for guests wash your hands often especially when you 're about to handle food
very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big
do n't hesitate to buy this light weight blanket it is wonderfully made the reason i 'm giving it a 5 rating is that it fits my california king bed i 've looked high and low to find a blanket that fits one does ! buy this blanket with confidence deffinately a great find on amazon and the price was n't bad either
we inherited a collection of vintage franciscan apple that have decorated our china hutch for almost 20 years recently i searched for an everyday dinnerware for my family of 5. after weeks of searching i chose the still available after 65 years '' apple pattern in addition to the microwave dishwasher safe freezer safe attributes i love the fact that these dishes are normal size my service for 12 actually fits in the cabinet and in the dishwasher the dishes are smaller and lighter weight than most patterns available today hurray ! who needs a coffee cup that is so large you ca n't drink it before it gets cold or a cereal bowl that looks like a mixing bowl the lighter weight is easier for children to handle so we have few accidents and i love the variety of open stock accessories still available after 20 years we still love mema 's old apple dishes
when i was a young woman my next door neighbors were a large family the mother an artist was very beautiful gracious and gentle i was often invited to share the family meals that were served on this franciscan apple dinnerware when it came time for me to purchase my everyday china i had no hesitation in choosing this nostalgic pattern i have a service for 16 now with all the extra pieces you can wash all of the franciscanware in the dishwasher but be sure to not use too much detergent highly recommended for those who like handpainted china and apples
first saw these in italy and fell in love ! these baskets help keep fingers and butter knives out of the toaster by simply lifting up the basket for shorter breads like italian or french toast mini bagels etc would highly recommend these to anyone who toasts ! i bought a set for my parents
i do n't have a dualit toaster but i do have a single wide slot cusinart toaster so i thought i 'd take a chance on this item it it works really well and i do n't have a problem with regular bread getting squished like the other reviewer mentioned take care when removing your sandwich as its easy to forget that the metal is quite hot when taken from the toaster
so the espresso machine is great it 's solidly built and has a very simple design to it i recommend this machine to anyone who wants to make espresso at home and would like their machine to last more than a couple years it 's moderately priced and by moderate i mean kind of high for a home system but definitely not 12 thousand dollars and it 's also pretty cool looking which is always a bonus issues that i 've had are few in number but i 'll give some hints in getting your new machine to work to your liking and by your liking i mean my liking first make sure the thing stays clean this is especially important when it comes to steaming milk the wand needs to be cleaned quickly thoroughly and often try to clean the machine every weeks heavy use and weeks light use with espresso machine cleaner this will make steaming milk much easier and faster since you 've removed the obstacles to the steam second making espresso takes some tinkering usually espresso at a coffee shop is run at around 140 degrees c on the machine espresso is set to run at around degrees c while steaming milk is set for 140 degrees simply set the machine to steam milk load your shot steam your milk and run your shot at 140 degrees start counting when the espresso starts dropping to about seconds if you 're not content with the rate or quantity adjust the espresso grind to more coarse or fine to increase or decrease the rate of the shot third this is all aesthetic but i find i get the best espresso from a vienna or french roast coffee personally i love sumatran coffee but costa rica papua new guinea ethiopia and kona hawai'i are close seconds buy fair trade and organic coffee and then enjoy some wicked good espresso happy coffee drinking !
good points 1 heats up to the right temperature relatively quickly 2 makes a great strong cup of espresso with great crema i have been using the lavazza gran crema pods never tried with ground espresso because i am trying to avoid a mess 3 mine takes about 20 seconds to go from espresso '' temperature to the hotter frothing '' temperature as opposed to the one or two minutes other machines take 4 it really does froth a nice thick froth nothing runny and flimsy like every other cappucino maker i have ever had ! 5 you can pretty much brew one shot after another with a few short seconds in betweeen to allow boiler to heat up the water to the right temp the consistency of brewing temperature is really very satisfactory and stable 6 you can make hot chocolates and tea with the frother and hot water coming from the frother respectively nice for a couple drinks at a time and a lot quicker than boiling a kettle for tea 7 obviously it is a beautiful piece and you will definitely notice it gets commented about looks good in a modern kitchen but is also just as comfortable in stainless pastel pink cream or white in a shabby retro or country romantic kitchen 8 the clean up is a total breeze if you are using pods points 1 the water resevoir will need to be refilled if you make longer '' or taller '' drinks like lattes and americanos '' especially if you are making drinks for two or more in a household if you prefer straight espresso shots and those topped off with a nice scoop or two of frothed milk you 're in business and can go for three days or more without otherwise be prepared to refill daily 2 the cup warmer '' on top of the machine is not really hot enough to keep the cups warm unless you turn the machine on for a good 20 or 30 minutes before brewing with the cups on top but it is a cute place to store the cups and i never really had problem drinking espresso from a room temp cup anyway have you just a small thing i noticed really but something i thought could be pointed out just to note i bought mine off ebay from the outlet refurbished and have had no problems it came with a 6 mos warranty and i saved hundreds if you can not come up with 800 bucks for one this is the way to go happy brewing and lattes of love
having worn out a capresso machine after daily brewing shots of espresso in making etc i went looking for a more durable machine i bought an in when it was a brand new model in stainless and it is great 1. it heats up quickly 2. it brews very consistently 3. the ese thing is the best ever 4. separate setting is great heats milk much faster than other cheaper consumer models 5. machine has capacity to steam enough milk for at least 3 tall lattes before needing a quick refill '' of water from the pump switch 6. i like the simplicity and total manual operation the switches are n't labeled but there 's only 3. kind of a morning meditation for me the most important things 1. do n't leave a pod in the holder and move temperature to steam setting when you unhook the pod holder steam will instantly blow apart the ese pod which given that it is more than boiling hot will hurt plus will dry instantly on the wall 2. use individually wrapped ese pods unless you use them all within hours of opening the tin they sour very quickly even in the freezer i am partial to starbucks pods given my household 's addiction to that brand but i think that is more of a preference than a quality issue illy tastes fine but you have to use them all quickly 3. if you serve a lot of guests the double unit might be better with the settings you 'll spend a lot of time running water through the unit to cool the steam setting back down to brew the next batch of espresso lots of refills of the water container which is a bit of a pain to remove from the back of the machine overall a great performer after 4 years of daily multiple use this thing is a great machine
two months ago i bought the from the new serie by appointment '' at the online store discount price about 500 usd including a box of 18 pods from amici the inventor of the machine francesco illy is a pope '' of the coffee industry he founded the francis francis '' company in switzerland his father and grandfather are the founder of the illy '' coffee brand a name for sophisticated taste of coffee francesco illy started to launch his own brand amici '' there are actually 4 different pods available my favourites are the espresso '' silver box with red stripe and ristretto '' black stripe please check for more information so that 's a little bit about history and now my review when i read the negative postings i wonder why there are some problems when using the machine or why the coffee gives some people only average joy here my suggestions for a real espresso experience rule 1 strictly use the pods one from amici or lavazza i can suggest not try to use pods they will not fit perfectly rule 2 buy some high quality espresso cups if the porcelain is robust and thick it can keep and lead the warmth much better rule 3 always use cup place them on top of the coffee machine i never turn off the machine if you switched of the machine wait about 20 minutes before preparing coffee and important pour one espresso cup of water before inserting any pod this guarantees that the cup gets his temperature and that the machine gets its operation temperature rule 4 keep your machine clean after every use clean the put it in the machine be sure there are no pods inside and simply pour water for about 10 seconds trough it rule 5 for the ones who experienced damages i think they did n't threat it correctly ! after using the steam you must switch back to the espresso mode and activate the toggle switch for espresso simply pour water about 20 seconds now the boiler will not overheat and protects the machine if you do not follow that rule your machine could be damaged seriously ! final commentary those people who wants to compare the with any one from braun for about 99 usd and think the taste is the same i must only say that they have no concept of good coffee taste the francis francis is nothing for people who confuse real espresso flavor with the plastic or paper taste of any mc donalds or dunkin ' donuts sewage the first time i have seen the i knew soon or less i will purchase it the unmistakable design did n't relinquish myself anymore every day walking to the kitchen the francis francis smiles at me a machine to take into one 's heart marcel dubach zuric
for the last 5 years i have been making 3 to 4 espressos a day with it i never had a problem ! it works great it 's expensive but it 's beautiful and worth the price i recommend lavazza espresso pods they make an excellent crema the yellow foam and no mess starbucks pods taste strong and slightly burn lavazza tastes like coffee made in an italian coffee shop or a little bistro in paris if you can afford it go for it ! also check out their cups francisfrancis they are beautiful original and perfect for espressos
received this heater in the mail a few days after ordering looks like a good quality heater it 's easy to adjust and read i 've had it for a month now and it keeps my 10 gallon planted tank at a steady temp
i purchased a 25 watt aquarium heater this week for my 5.5 gallon freshwater tropical aquarium so far so good the temperature has maintained where i set it for several days with virtually no fluctuation the temp scale is printed large and easy to read the temp adjustment knob at the top is tapered and somewhat tricky to if you ca n't get a good grip on it but once set there 's little need to make further adjustments there 's a red led light that comes on when the unit is heating the light goes off when the heater cycles off the bracket has 2 suction cups and securely holds the heater upright and straight this brand of aquarium heater came highly recommended by others who wrote online reviews amazon and most pet store websites do n't carry the 25 watt model so i bought it on an auction website total cost 25 included shipping
for years i have been sharpening the knives in our household i have used wet stones diamond sticks ceramic sticks and many other methods in fact i have a draw full of different sharpening devices but nothing has put an edge on knives like the chef 's choice professional station you must read the directions before you start to us the or you can ruin your knives
this item was rated tops by cooks illustrated my 10 year old henckel knives are now the way there were the first day i bought them and the edges hold use after use they are razor sharp i love the result
i cook all the dinners here at home and sharp knives are an asset in the kitchen a word of warning from the manufacturer is very true warning knives sharpened on the chef 's choice will be sharper than you expect use them with great care '' i taped their warning to our knife rack as a reminder in short the manufacturer 's instructions are very easy to follow and the knife sharpener is very easy to use as well it 's a little pricey but if you want really sharp knives you wo n't be disappointed you can sharpen all your kitchen knives serrated knives and pocket knives too my knives are sharper than when i bought them good luck
we bought this particular sharpener because it was rated the best electric knife sharpener by cook 's illustrated magazine we are extremely happy with the product and what it has done for our knives
the knives we got for our wedding 7 years ago had become dangerously dull no more ! i had been wary of ruining our expensive knives with a yourself sharpener but after reading the cooks illustrated review of this sharpener i was convinced it 's great and my knives are once again nice and sharp
buy this product if you ever plan on using a knife i have a decent set of henckels that i bought about 4 years ago i 've had them professionally sharpened twice since i bought them and was never really satisfied with the edge that they came back with i bought the and have used it once and what a difference ! my knives have never been sharper ! i find myself wanting to prepare meals more often just so i get to use my killer new '' knives i also used this sharpener on some other utility knives pocket knives carving knives etc if i could sharpen it i did it with the and have never been happier !
i have a 15 year old model 110 which was n't delivering any more i bought the 130 and it is vastly superior this is the top of the line
works great on most knifes if you have cheap knives you can not get a good bevel edge on the blade would recommend to anyone
i have tried a number of different knife sharpeners over the years and have always been unhappy with the results even if i carefully followed the instructions on how to sharpen a knife they never seemed to be any where near as sharp as when they were new i read a report on knife sharpeners in cooks and the was the highest rated and the most expensive as i recall we decided to order the machine and it really works the knives are actually as sharp as they were when purchased you could probably open a business sharpening knives with this machine and it would pay for itself you could also impress your friends and family by sharpening their knives i recommend this machine
i previously owned the from chef 's choice and was generally pleased with the results but found you had to really follow the instructions and run multiple passes to achieve success i also found the results inconsistent between knife and blade styles based on previous reports of this sharpener i decided to upgrade bottom line simpler faster and better results you can have hair shaving results in as little as six strokes from start to finish highly recommended if you are serious about sharp knives
very nice scale well designed good price it has what you tare and both whieght systems mine 's very accurate and it 's a good easy to stash but big enough to put things on i 'm very pleased recommend it as the deal
i love having a scale in my kitchen and this one is nice and small so it does n't take up a lot of space no more guessing fantastic ! my only complaint is that it measures in lbs and ounces so you need to do some math if you need say pound which is 4 oz if my math is right
its a great scale that measures accurately and very quick it 's pretty cheap and weighs up to 11 pounds it also has the tare button to zero it out which is one of the most useful things ever my only complain other than that it uses a battery is that it really is n't very washable and you ca n't remove the top to wash it off from stuff that may get on it nonetheless it is an excellent product
what can i say it does what it is supposed to do and it does it well battery is easy enough to change it does standard and metric and it is accurate not much else to say except you will be happy with this scale
this scale is beautiful low profile easy to use and easy to clean its everything i needed for a good price
i love my new scale i can put a bowl on it and tare back to zero add my ingredient and tare back to zero and continue adding and taring without ever removing my bowl since i received my scale i have found everything so far easier to weigh it takes so little room on my counter and it looks so nice and sleek sitting there plus it cleans up beautifully with just a damp cloth i would recommend this scale to everyone
i purchased 2 sets of these glasses in december 2006. they look great have a nice heavy feel to them are of obvious good quality i could not be happier and i 'm now going to order the larger 13.5 oz size too if you have any doubts you can forget them now and buy these classy glasses if you like the look of this style you will not regret this purchase
the ice crusher is a bit noisy and i was a little dismayed that you had to put in one cube at a time but overall i am pleased it does a good quick job without any mess
it does a pretty good job on crushing the ice tends to bounce around '' on the counter while performing the job
i like soft ice in my drinks yes it is noisy and messy but it gives me the ice i want in less than a couple of minutes and beats the heck out of buying sonic ice it reminds me of snow cone ice
it is great for every refreshing drinks i use it to make '' mix mixture of sweetened beans young coconut flan jackfruit etc sweets put them in a nice big glass then add crushed ice on top and milk mixed them all together ! ! ! ! ! the only thing that i find that can slow you down if you put too much pieces of big ice it will get stock so few piesec at a time
i purchased this ice crusher to make some great icy drinks the unit works perfectly and the crushed ice blends much better that trying to use whole ice cube
this pan work very well nothing sticks to it and it is very easy to clean
i am really happy with the purchase first of all it was for a great price the product is great no oil is necessary cleaning is really easy great to make frittata coz goes straight to the oven from the stove i love this product its beautifu
i use this always except for meat i got the silicone ones with pictures on it to stop cross contamination buy this
came fast ! easy to put together the knob is not tight no matter how hard i try to screw it in that is my only complaint
this bowls are excellent for the lids dont come off and they are sooo easy to put on and get unlike some other items they clean up so much easier than other plastic types i have 2 sets of these there an excellent buy
i love these bowls and the price is fantastic they will have many uses the colors are very nice the lids fit nice and tight and are quite sturdy a must have for anyone who has the sango nova set
columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time i did n't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom the color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender they call it plumberry the weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it when the washcloths are completely drenched they do seem a little more heavy than most although they have that spa feel '' to them and they retain heat very well which makes them sort of comforting i 've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent i 've found they are made with 100 combed cotton and have a heavier feel the edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they do n't fall apart the first time you wash them rebecca review
i have a family of 5 and we use our fryer almost weekly works great for bacon to keep your stove top cleaner and anything else you want to cook
my mother gave me this lodge fryer she has had for many years and i have been happy with it for more than five years now incredible for making stew in this fryer has been used for almost everything except frying chicken every lodge product our family has had has lasted for as long as i can remember i am 29 now and requires little maintanence a little seasoning oil and heat every once in a while is all cooking in this fashion imparts a wonderful flavor to meats tomatoes breads whatever ! forget the cooking sets from the big boys cast iron handles cleans very well if and is actually best if you do n't clean it too hard and lodge is made here in america in tennessee ! who knows where that other stuff is made as i get older lodge will definitely continue to be part of my cookware collection make them part of yours if you have n't already
i like cooking bacon in this because my stove stays a lot cleaner than using my regular depth lodge skillets
i have a growing number of cast iron pans from lodge and this is one of my most used and favorite pieces i use it for sauces casseroles home fries and just about anything that requires a pan larger than a fry pan but size is just one of the plusses of this pan like all cast iron pans the more you use it the better it gets mine is virtually from all the use it has gotten and save for the first time i took it out of the box it has never been washed with soap a simple brushing a complete drying and a thin application of shortening is all you need to keep this pan clean and if you have n't tried cast iron before i would encourage you to try this pan as it can be used as a skillet fry pan and shallow dutch oven i am certain that if you follow the directions for seasoning and cleaning you will be rewarded with a utensil that will last a lifetime
this pan is slightly bigger than the lodge combo cooker pan the lid arches up allowing more volume but then you ca n't use the lid as a griddle lodge fry pans are all great this one too but if you are in the market for a pan consider the combo cooker vs this one
this is one of the best all around pieces of cookware everyone should have if they cook makes a great wedding gift i keep this on my back burner all the time therefore it gets used i bake cornbread pineapple upside down cakes roasts hams fried chicken baked chicken corn beef fried potatoes eggs grilled sandwiches spagetti sauce gravy and anything i can think of one of the easiest ways i use it is to put a chuck roast in cover it with package of onion soup mix and cups of water add potatoes and carrots cover and put on at degrees cook for about 3 hours perfect for those who want a meal right after church roast can be cut with a fork if this gets put away it just wo n't get used as much so leave it on the burner i reseason this every so often because it can stick after i cook with water or tomatoes if i had only one piece of cookware to take with me it would be the cast iron chicken fryer
i made wonderful fried chicken in this pan ! it has the perfect depth for frying and an even heat distribution i have also used it to make other recipes it is extremely versatile
if you like to make gumbo or even simple hearty gravies this is the only way the ability of cast iron to evenly distribute heat and remain flat at very high temperatures ensure that anyone can make a to black roux with confidence
i got this water filter a few days ago and it is great ! the water tastes cleaner and better than the tap this product will let you chug away because one filter lasts 100 gallons of water i live in omaha nebraska and the water here is bad but the pur changed everything my mother has had one for a year now and has not had any problems with her pur the bypass feature is also a good idea the pitcher styles are not as easy to use as the sink mount ones would recomend to anyone who wants to drink that 8 glasses a day without breaking the bank
the chrome look of this unit is quite nice and really does look like chrome does n't look cheap like some other metallic plastics matching chrome fixtures nicely but the important part is that this filter really does its job you 'll find at pur 's website that the pur ulitmate is nsf certified to effectively filter 28 contaminants listed in nsf standard 53 whereas some competing products including a popular disposable model that does n't use cartridges claim certification for less than a third of those i 'm sure there are truly comparable filters out there but check the specs before you buy flow rate seems reasonable to me i can fill up my coffee carafe in under a minute and i do n't mind taking a couple of extra seconds for the peace of mind that i 'm drinking cleaner safer water after all i wo n't be needing it for washing dishes or taking a shower it 's very easy to install and it seems more durable than an older generation pur filter i had that developed leaks after a while this one has been working for almost a year with no leakage at all
the product was familiar to me and i was very pleased to get such a quality product for a reasonable price it was shipped and arrived here in good time thanks !
we just got this chair and metropolitan sofa from target for our sunroom it has a great modern look and a solid feel i assembled this very easily by myself in less than half an hour chair cushion is firm this is a beautiful chair that goes well with the metropolitan collection great for a modern or retro look in your room
this set has large sturdy utensils in a beautiful ceramic crock with room for other tools looks great on the counter
i bought this item for my daughter quince i was a great buy ! the motor is quite and the light is great however it does splash a little when it gets a little low on liquid but if you put a garland around the base it will catch the small droplets it really looks pretty i am sure to use it at the hollidays and other birthdays but i do have to point out this fountain is a 2.5 gal not a 3 gal
i ca n't rave enough about this beautiful rival fountain ! i got it for my son 's wedding shower then the wedding then used it 2 months after for my 11 yr old 's birthday party too ! we used it at the wedding reception for sweet tea of all things ! it kept it elegant easy to serve even with the brown tea color it was still beautifully illuminated very elegant it was elegant enough to use at the wedding reception we just encircled the base with floral garland ! made serving the guests much easier ! i also used it 2 months later for my daughter 's birthday hawaiian themed party ! look below for the non alcohol koolaid pineapple juice fruit punch recipe ! it kept the kid 's coming back for more drinks ! they felt like little grownups it made my birthday girl feel so special having the beverage fountain on display for her birthday a huge hit with the kids ! i can see myself using this for years ! i got a huge discount shopping for it on i got it for a third of the original store price ! yeah me ! kid 's party or non alcohol koolaid punch recipe a day or two before the party you can mix 3 seperate gallons of koolaid up use your old milk jugs if you have to the koolaid recipe calls for 1 packet unmixed koolaid powder along with 1 cup sugar but for less sugar substitute 1 cup splenda instead of the 1 c sugar per packet it normally calls ! set aside at least 3 premixed koolaids in gallon containers put in fridge to chill when ready to serve the day of the party pour 2 of the koolaid gallons into fountain then turn fountain on as it goes up the tube start to add 1 full can pineapple juice it 's about 42 oz or something like that then add 1 litre of gingeraile that 's half of a 2 litre bottle the kids liked to substitute half or the recipe 's amount of pineapple juice as we mixed more of it because they said the juice was so tangy sweet they like the koolaid taste better but you can adjust the koolaid to juice ratio as needed add only 1 litre of gingeraile to the 2 gallons of koolaid because adding any more soda in one it will bubble up too much could kill the motor keep adding gallon of koolaid juice soda as needed toss leftovers or chill use day after kids can be a bit messy so might want to put an absorbant layer of tablecloth under the fountain
bought this fountain after i had borrowed one for a new years eve party this one was even better than the one i borrowed ! very sturdy quiet and easy to put together and clean the light in the middle makes this a great eye catcher i kept getting compliments on it all night ! this is a great product at a great price shipping was fast too
what a wonderful adult toy after seeing one of these fountains in operation at a christmas party and noticing how useful effective and popular it was with everyone my wife and i decided we would get one thanks to the power of the internet and amazon we now have one we may not use it as a soft drink fountain at all but as a decorative water piece in the house as a distraction from the dreadful winter we are having just now john sutherland
i recieved the fountain on time and everyone was amaized at it i will be using it often in our churc
perfect for our daughter 's sweet 16 birthday bash at our church
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat due to this efficiency it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide rust does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds 2 quarts of food measures 7 x 11 inches internally and weighs 6 pounds 2 quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need this may be the pan for families from except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset 7 x 9 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 6 pounds
i have three yes 3 of these in my shower one for my face soap one for mild body soap and one for antibacterial soap these sort of hang down so the soap scum does n't get on the wall it drips on the shower floor i do n't even use the built in ceramic soap holder because it just gets soap scum in it these are great ! you will find it much easier to keep you shower clean by using these soap holders
this fan is just beautiful very clean lines and it does n't look like most ceiling fans it 's also very very easy to install three wires connect to the fan from the remote receiver and three to your home wiring the blades snap right into place and once the plate is mounted to your receptacle box fan rated of course the fan goes into place and is held by four screws there 's a little hook on the mounting plate that you can use to hold the fan in place while you make all the connections i wish every lighting fixture had that at low speed you can barely hear it and it seems to move quite a bit of air it appears to be extremely well built and the fit and finish is perfect it comes with a remote that has three fan speeds a stop and a reverse for the fan and switch for the light
great product easy to clean we purchased this mainly for grating cheese much cheaper to buy a block of cheese also many more varieties to choose from will be great for many things though !
i have had this product for a couple of days now and do n't know why i never tried it before it works great and you do n't have to cut cucumber or small potatoes i had seen the cuisinart on tv and almost bought it and thought about the salad shooter i am a single senior and do not have the need for such a pricey one but needed it as i am getting rid of heavy food processor but still wanted to be able to slice and shred should have bought this long ago saves space can you tell i love love it
this is the one i 've had the first lasted about 18 years hopefully the second will last that long also use it daily for all garden products and cheese ca n't live without it
perfect for grating cheese the hardest thing to grate messy to hand wash but fine in dishwasher worth it wise bu
now i can chop or shred anything for my salads ! great product i recommend it
afetr reading the reviews i was still a little skeptical and thought could shredding cheese really be that easy well it 's easy breezy and completely mess free ! ! the parts you do use are dishwasher safe so you 're done with your shredding and cleaning in minutes the motor is powerful and the slicer works great as well i can not imagine being without this neat gadget in my kitchen
i have owned the smaller salad shooter for many years and it still works ! and have always loved the ease of use and easy cleaning i stick it right in the dishwasher so i wanted the bigger one to try coleslaw with it i think i 'll stick to my food processor for the cabbage shredding because i had to cut the cabbage up too small but this will do almost everything else with ease it 's very powerful i love it to shred cheese carrots etc the extra attachments give you a lot of variety in slice thickness and the best thing is you can aim it right over the bowl or dish that you 're preparing and the food will shoot right in without dirtying another bowl ! great for summer salads ! i bought my daughter one too and she loves it
the presto 02790 is probably great for many things but for my house it 's great for shredding cheese for mexican food a staple in our household
excellent it arrived quite quickly and is absolutely awesome we had an older salad shooter that had worked well but could not compare to the professional model and the price at amazon was great plus no shipping charge great job amazon
this leveler worked great but only on cakes that have soft not crusty sides since the cutting blade '' is only a wire cutting through anything too hard or crumbly is difficult it would be nicer if instead of a wire it had a serrated blade but if you do have a crusty cake you can simply wrap the cake in plastic wrap and let it sit a day this will soften the sides so that this leveler will still work also keep in mind this leveler is only 10 inches wide and 2 inches high so you may get into trouble with larger cakes it works great for torting a cake and getting those really thin layers it sure is a lot easier than using a knife
i own reidel sommelier glasses reidel vinum glasses and reidel extreme glasses i put these rabbit glasses into the same category as the vinums from reidel they are great everyday glasses for people like me who tend to drink fairly good wines and tend to drink fairly portions these glasses are certainly not in the same category as reidel sommeliers but then again they cost about as much
cuts like the best knife i 've ever used looks cool though my wife says the make it look dirty feels comfortable in my hand if i was in a movie and needed a knife to defend myself from the i 'd want this knife to be the one my scrabbling fingers find as i desparately grope across the kitchen counters note packaging is cheesy and you do n't want to just throw this in a drawer so you need a block or magnet rack or something to store it
purchased one for 33 and love it i 've had the calphalon essential set for about 3 years and have been happy with the balance and handling i mainly use the 6 '' utility and the 3 '' pairing knife however i found the thickness of the blade on 7 '' chef knife to make it slightly dull for me on many task the katana knife is in a entire different league from calphalon 's orginal set it cuts with very little effort and has great balance
this knife feels great in the hand and arrives very sharp i am not sure what is the point of the layers of damascene the last half inch before the edge is presumably is where the action takes place and it is good clear stainless the damascene pattern is certainly attractive despite report you may have heard to the contrary the edge of the blade is not straight like a santoku knife it curves the same amount as a henckels chef knife having said that i guess if you are a chopper you might prefer a big belly wusthof the bolster is very unobtrusive which i like the handle is comfortable and tilts up a little sort of like the global knives but less extreme did i already say this knife arrives very sharp right out of the box you can cut through the stem of a banana almost as if it was celery do n't let your old use this knife for cutting frozen bagels SMILE it is a really nice knife that i would use all the time if my wife had not taken such a posessive interest in it
i 've only used it a few times i bought it when it was on sale for 35 dollars very good for the price i 'm sure there 's probably sharper knives out there but for 35 dollars you ca n't beat that this is why i gave it five stars it 's also a cool looking knife but even for 50 dollars i think this is a good knife to get but really i think when it comes to knives everyone has their own opinion so good luck
if you 're a confirmed tea drinker then get this type of teapot it 's the best there are many sizes out there although i prefer the little one for my solo drinking adventures my only complaint with japanese iron teapots is that sometimes they rust around the handle rings although i find that the ochre colored dust adds to their overall charm
perfect i love have been looking everywhere for these and finally found them here
i really like this it makes great little 'cookies ' that my family loved it is fairly easy to use but there is a learning curve on how much batter to place on the forms great item
this krumkaka baker is wonderful ! ! i have a krumkaka maker and always had trouble with it took a long time to bake krumkaka and such made a batch of krumkaka right away after receiving the new electric baker and match a full batch in less than an hour and they were delish ! ! i would highly recommend this baker to anyone that has ever considered buying one it is a wonderful machine ! ! love the surface ! !
i was looking for a pizzelle maker and after extensive research this was the best option including the price these cookies are wonderful and the krumkake maker works great it heats up the way it should and the instructions are easy to follow
i had n't made krumkake since i was 1975 ! i loved making them again and the maker was great ! it is easy to clean too a different and delicious treat i loved this product
this item is fantastic ! ! having just tried krumkake this past may while visiting family in alaska we were excited to come home and try to make them ourselves they are similar to pizelles but better we could n't wait for this maker to arrive and made krumkake the very next day they were so good we would recomend this item to anyone who ever tried krumkake and wants to relive thay wonderful memory at home ! ! it perfectly made two krumkake in less than 1 minute and comes with a great rolling cone to shape them we ate ours plain but i am sure they are fantastic with powdered sugar or many of the wonderful fillings the directions suggest we just could n't wait to decorate them or fill them i will definitely be making these wonderful cookies this christmas to share with our family hope you enjoy ! !
i love my new cookies 's maker it so easy to use and fast to get good cookies for dessert
i love it so much ! it is so easy to use and the krumkate came out very thin however the product is made in china '' not made in usa '' as indicated under its description i experienced that the cookies came out rather dark so i used a timer instead of waiting for the light it will take approximately one minute and 45 seconds for each cookie i set mine as one minute and 25 seconds if you want a thin krumkate your batter should be thin the thinner the faster it will take so adjust your timer accordingly it is easy to clean with a dam towel or paper towe
after spending many years using a manual krumkake baker shoulder arthritis made it impossible i actually dreaded the season and the krumkake i always made to give as gifts with my new electric krumkake baker i just made a batch in only 1 hour usually took 3 hours on the stove no burned fingers and no shoulder arthitic problem ! and my very first krumkake turned out perfectly it usually took me about 5 to get it right '' with my system thanks for a terrific product and recipe i 'll use it all year not only at christmastime
i have this pan and i seriously love it i love the versatility we have used it for housewarming gifts for new neighbors as well as for cakes for my decorating business the cakes have all come out fabulously and they have not stuck at all it 's a fabulous cake pan probably good for monkey bread blueberry bread or anything else you can imagine as well have fun with it !
i purchased this set as a gift i wanted the good stuff my own set has lasted over ten years i would give it five stars if it was dishwasher friendly it 's does clean up real easy
is there a better measuring cup it is ergonomic soft rubber handle read from above and all that but look at the design this cup should be in a museum collection if it is not already buy all three comes in 1 cup 2 cup and a mini 2 oz without a handle and you will have a nifty display of modern sculpture in your kitchen
the oxo stainless measuring cup is the perfect measuring cup it wo n't crack when you pour boiling water in it it is shaped and marked so you can easily look down from the top and see just exactly how much you have put in it i admit i did n't quite believe that till i got it it is 100 true the handle is the typical oxo black insulated material so you do n't get burned and it is balanced to make pouring easy the funnel '' lip avoids spills it is truly the perfect measuring cup im my opinion
i love this pan it is perfect for making pancakes or a few grilled cheeses
this is the bowl i reach for consistently it holds a lot without taking up lots of counter space and stores efficiently it has high enough sides so that the kids do n't slop pancake batter all over and the bottom is a godsend ! you have to own this bowl
these bowls are very nice and they do not move about while you stir your whatever '' they are worth the cost and you will be pleased with any of them they pour well and the hand grip is useful in handling the bowl good items
this bowl has a nice weight to it does n't slide around on the counter and has a soft comfortable grip great bowl
i own every size of this bowl and if they made more i 'd buy them in fact i 'm thinking about throwing away all my other bowls and just buying several more of these they are absolutely the greatest mixing bowls ever made they wo n't slide around the bottow is rubber or something like it they are steep sided so things do n't splash out they are easy to clean and they look great i could just could go on and on with praise about these bowls i 'm 63 years old and i cook a lot i 've never had a better product buy these you wo n't be disappointed
i have this bowl and the smaller one they are perfect bowls for mixing the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put i was them in the dishwasher without any problems
this mixing bowl is a good size for most any task its easy to use and clean up is easy great quality
does everything claimed and is useful for many things
i bought the 4 quart first and loved it but it was too large for some things so ordered this one and just adore it it 's the perfect size to mix my little salads in pancake batter meat name it and it small things love the bottom the handle the pouring spout the high about it and nothing but praise here 5 stars all the way
love it love it love it ! i did n't buy it until i read every single review and decided i had to try it high sides make for easy stirring no slip bottom is awesome as i always did the bowl chase '' when trying to stir handle is a plus for grabbing and holding on spout great for what i purchased it for pouring batter for and easy clean my husband refuses to mix in any bowl but that one so i constantly have to wash it out to get a turn ! awesome
approx exterior measurements x x item was bigger than i expected from online pic can hold papers without folding just barely big enough for a envelope no shipping problems item in perfect condition some similar items were listed as being made with plastic that scissors could cut through this is not the case with this item it appears very solid hinges are not visible and lock appears solid when i purchased this item i was just looking for something to protect documents against fire and water damage i was n't counting on something that looked like a i am pleasantly surpised
came well packaged and in perfect shape we love it and will continue to for many years
this bread box is just lovely mine arrived in perfect condition the interior measurements are 15 '' long by 8.5 '' wide the box is 6 '' deep the wooden lid is lovely although i do n't plan on using mine as a bread board so i can preserve it i did need to air mine out for a few days when it arrived there are air holes on each side but it had that brand new paint smell and needed to be completely open for a while before regular use i love having my bread out of sight in a container that really adds something special to my kitchen 's decor
well it was a gift but it looked sturdy and well made i don not know if the receipent has hung it yet or if any bats have moved in
this is a great product very lightweight and comfortable i have enjoyed using this for my mac powerbook the surface is wide enough for the laptop and an external mouse i highly recommend it
the best laptop desk i 've ever found if you get size larger than your laptop you 'll have space at side with amazingly good surface for an optical mouse whole thing is very sturdy well constructed even though it 's very lightweigh
i bought this on amazon back in january 2007. i love it almost every day very light weight and helps my legs cool i have a mac book pro and got the 18 '' i could fit the mouse on the space but choose not too tight to fit the 15 '' and a mouse i highly recommend this product
or other widescreen laptop computer or even just want some extra this lap desk is a fantastic choice it even comes with rubber feet to help elevate your laptop for cooling if the feet on your machine are n't doing the job this also helps keep the machine from sliding at all on the smooth surface of the lap desk having looked for a lap desk as a gift for my room mate i wanted something lightweight and portable but large enough to be functional and over all to be comfortable the lapinator plus was all that and then some eventually i 'm going to get one for myself
for many reasons the only way i can use my laptop is my lap think hot hot hot after several hours being in the boondocks i had no idea there were actual products to remedy my problem can you say 'google ' in a nutshell the lapinator is great and does all it says i was only concerned in the heat factor but a great side benefit is how much more comfortable my wrists and arms are with the lapinator plus the lapinator seems to grip the computer so it stays put realized how much it wobbled i 'm so pleased with my lapinator that i have bought one for my who works on his laptop everywhere the sofa in an airplane he 's thrilled with his too i might add that shipping was great also you ca n't beat the price but at double the cost i 'd buy another one if needed
so far it seems to work as advertised the only complaint i have is that the price is more than i would have payed had i seen the product first its not rediculously overpriced but it could be a little cheaper otherwise it is a sturdy lapdesk overall i am pleased
the only problem i tried to figure how you could make the label harder to remove from the surface and came up with nothing
wow ! ! ! when i saw this light and simple design i was not sure what to expect i used this for an entire day working on a paper with my laptop it really did keep my lap totally cool ! it 's light and comfortable ! i also set the lapinator plus on the couch with my laptop on it that worked like a charm too ! the underside of the lapinator never felt hot to the touch my laptop does n't shift at all whether it 's on my lap the couch or the bed this is a great product and worth the price in my humble opinion ! it 's plenty sturdy without being heavy yet it is not flimsy at all what an achievement in design and construction !
does not spit or leak very powerful steam action can steam hanging clothes with the iron held vertically glides smoothly and is solid and well engineered
i had to review this after reading the only other review for this fan i am certain i have reviewed this fan for amazon before but for some reason do n't see it here i use two of these fans to move air around in my swiss gear tent while camping in texas it is made from plastic and like all other plastic products it is breakable if you muscle your way to using it wrong but usage is fairly straight forward to open the leg simply swing it down from the back of the fan on its hinge opening the battery compartment is fairly simple as well if you understand what lock and unlock icons mean the fan moves lots of air and the ones i own have taken plenty of abuse being tossed into and out of the back of my truck for the last two years my only complaint with them is the battery compartment cover is a little tough to get back on until you figure out exactly how it works and on high it will suck an expensive set of d cell batteries down in 24 hours if you use these a lot i would strongly recommend getting a couple of sets of rechargable d cells and a charger or getting the model with the built in rechargable batteries i like that this model is also available with a transformer that you can use to run it off of power which makes camping in sites with electricity much less of a drain in the wallet ! i rated this fan a 5 as i feel it is the best of its breed it is not to be compared to a corded box fan or anything like that since you do different things with them but this fan is the absolute best of its kind that i have tried i have used several different models from coleman this thing moves so much more air that there really is no comparison the coleman fans simply do not move air like this thing
i got my raclette as a christmas present and it is one of the best gifts i 've ever received ! i love to have people over and this provides a unique and easy way to serve dinner or snacks to everyone 's tastes everyone really has fun with it this particular raclette works very well i have no complaints the only word of warning i 'd give to would be buyers is that it 's not for kids that may seem obvious to some but we always have kids that want to participate in the fun it 's inevitable around my house with five of my own and it creates a lot more work to keep them from being burned otherwise it 's an awesome product that we enjoy more than our fondue and chocolate fountain
i learned of raclette while living in germany several years ago and found upon return to the states that they were no where to be found now they are available and i love the one i bought in fact i am ordering another as a late christmas gift it is great for dinner parties and keeps guests happy they are eating what they selected and cooked to their liking
we are very pleased with our hb raclette grill ! we originally tried raclette cooking in france with friends and bought our own we 've used it for entertaining and daily dining and everyone has a blast with it ! all you have to do is prepare food items potatoes cheese deli meats veggies eggs etc and each person cooks up their own combination as the food you enjoy great conversation with up to eight friends over the raclette and perhaps a glass of wine cleaning is simple given the removable parts and cooking surfaces the machine is quite handsome more stylish than other comparables with those crescent handles and nifty baby pans the grill that rests on top is very useful and easily removable the machine comes with the temperature dial on one side and the red indicator light letting you know that the machine is plugged in heating is fairly quick the heat resistant plastic baby spatulas are surprisingly versatile some other raclettes do n't come with an indicator light or spatulas ! if i had to note anything i did n't fully appreciate it would be that the machine does n't seem to have an off mode other than pulling the plug the only other thing to mention is concerning grill cooking if the heat is up high and you leave fatty foods or oil on top splatter can occur firing unfriendly and making clean up a bit more work this is true of any indoor grill though just be careful all in all we love the raclette and use it happily and quite often ! it is highly recommended
i first tried a raclette prepared meal in 2002 while visiting my fiancee 's parents in lyon france needless to say i was hooked straight away although raclette meals can be heavy potatoes cheese and various meats and veg they are extremely good the hamilton beach 31602 raclette grill is great temperature control is a nice feature i have used it a lot since i bought it and recommend it good value for money and even has some recipes to try in the instruction manual
i bought this raclette grill to add to an existing collection i was a bit hesitant because i typically do not purchase hamilton beach products i have to say i like this machine better than my other more expensive european models it certainly is great value for money and easy to use i highly recommend it !
this raclette grill meets my every was a great value for the price
the hb 31602 is an excellent raclette grill at a price well below that of most other raclettes on the market now this is my second grill the first a machine died after about 10 years of use i decided to try the hb because of its features and attractive price as well as my previous favorable experience with amazon in the event i wanted to return the item in short the unit functions perfectly its variable temperature control a must for raclette cooking does its job well clean up a frequent gripe among raclette grill reviewers is a breeze that you only use the top grill to cook normal foods such as small potatoes sausages or canadian bacon not frying eggs and that you treat the surface properly although the listing copy does n't make this clear the unit comes with both the rectangular pans and the plastic scrapers and the cord length another complaint is quite adequate the only potential shortcoming is the way the item is shipped in its retail box only the way you would pick it up at a store that means the only thing between your grill and the rough world of a ups trip is a few pieces of packing and a flimsy box recipe for disaster fortunately my unit arrived ok though the box was pretty beat up amazon should require its third party 'partners ' to use shipping cartons like amazon itself always does on the positive side my one experience with amazon re a item was very satisfactory
actually i do n't own this particular machine but am considering purchasing it i have two krups machines a combination machine the cafe duomo and an old venerable espresso mini that 's used mostly for travel and for when we need more espresso capacity for when we have guests over i have no complaints with either machine and in fact would consider myself with both machines i 've been using distilled water to make espresso for about 20 years and as a result have never had to additionally regarding cleaning the steam nozzle it 's best to clean it immediately after frothing that way the milk is still soft and easy to remove with a wet cloth if you allow the milk to dry or to otherwise build up on the steam nozzle tube after multiple uses said buildup will harden and become a much more difficult proposition to remove regarding that perfect froth attachment '' well my first krups espresso mini vintage early 80 's was before the pfa was introduced so i grew up '' steaming frothing milk sans pfa on subsequent krups machines that came with the pfa i opted to remove same as i could see what a cleaning and sanitary issue it would become hope this info helps
when the first one died after 12 years of use we replaced it with the same model very reliable good quality and does a decent job of espresso and steamed milk although it 's by no means a real professional 's unit the one thing that has consistenly bugged me is the shape of the spout on the coffeepot for some reason i literally can not pour it when near full without the water or coffee sticking to the side of the pot and running down and dribbling off the bottom so every morning i have this ritual of filling the water and then cleaning up all the water that the darned pot dribbles off the side and then pouring coffee and cleaning coffee off the counter i assure you all i have reasonable coordination but we really like the unit otherwise
i am really pleased with this machine it makes a wonderful cup of regular coffee and using it for espresso and cappuchino is quite easy when i opened it i was a little concerned because it looks complicated but its not directions are clear my purchase experience was great as well i recommend it its a tidy package and i do n't have to litter my counter tops with several coffee machines this does it all
we 've used the cuisinart grind brew for over 8 years but recently decided we needed an upgrade ! after searching and reading reviews by others decided on this machine we were not disappointed although this machine does n't grind the beans it makes a great cup of regular coffee and the espresso and cappuccino features are very easy to use and make a great cuppa as my aussie says ! my husband also likes the easy clean up since that 's his job !
i have been very pleased with our maker it is very simple to use for beginners like myself and easy to clean it is also a nice size so it does not overwhelm the counter the instructions were very clear and i had no trouble using the frother it just took a little practice
this is one great coffee maker for the price espresso temperature is n't too hot but the cappucino maker is fantastic the instructions are very straight forward and i was able to make a good cup of cappucino on my first try
i purchased one of these about 12 years ago at an auction and fell in love with it it worked beautifully for 12 years making coffee at least once per day and espresso several times per week when it finally died i searched for it but wanted to see if i could just buy something cheaper i bought krups and machines and returned every one of them and opted to go back to this machine despite it slightly higher price this is the best coffee ever and the espresso is perfect !
this is a great idea for quickly wrapping around your coiled hose hanging on a nail in the garage
my first review of this item was two stars however after having contact with sharper image i am now changing my rating to four stars sharper image is a company with integrity and they truly stand behind their customer guarantee
it does keep the coffee fresh ! ! we depend on it buy it ! ! it even looks great
we ordered this sofa and matching ottoman on with a discount we recieved via email it has far exceeded our expectations ! i read all the reviews and they are dead on the upholstery is darker the cushions are firm and comfortable it 's very nice the frame is solid and the fabric luxurious the only problem we had is with the freight conractor that target used being slow to communicate but it did arrive in one piece and was easy to put together having 2 people helped if you are thinking about this couch ahead ! you wo n't be sorry it 's high quality and affordable ! this is very durable and looks like it costs twice as much i would buy it all over again ! we love it
i liked the loveseat so much that i bought the couch it 's comfy supportive and not too difficult to put together from the pictures the frame is sturdy but i suggest adding some glue to the 2 pieces screwed onto the back which support the seat just for added strength
i ca n't express how satisfied i am with this collection i purchased the entire set and it has transformed my living room into a home makeover '' worthy work of art the web does n't do it justice it is much prettier and is finer than the pics can portray very easy to assemble and you oohhhh and ahhhh '' while you do it because you ca n't believe how good it looks for the price yes we all clapped when we were done because it looks so fabulous thank goodness for
we actually purchased the 4 piece set unfortunately leaving a review was not an option there it is indeed a hardwood frame and beautiful microfiber cusions that have covers the color is definitely more along the lines of a hot chocolate color rather than the creamy chai color on the but still blends beautifully into a neutral palette br br the assembly was a bit you may need a third or fourth hand the instructions certainly are n't complete they are more like general pictures so there 's a bit of guesswork involved the upholstered side panels take a bit of elbow grease '' to fit into the frame properly took us about an hour to put together with a few adjustments for precision br br i love that the back cushions have velcro to hold them on and in place the cushions are also surprizingly firm but because the seat is longer than average legs you have a tendancy to lounge i 'm not sure what the weight restrictions are but we had about 700 lbs on the couch and it remained in one piece ca n't say that for all couches we 've had ! overall a very impressive package for the price ! we received free shipping and used a 10 off online coupon code so it was a great deal i also highly suggest the matching table set
it was a little tricky to put together by myself and the instructions could have been clearer now it 's done and i love my new sofa ! it 's so much nicer than i expected to get for this price i highly recommend the matching tables too
we got this just after christmas and it is absolutely the best cup of coffee that we have had since we were in italy i ca n't stand to drink drip coffee anymore there are several things to keep in mind for the best results 1 use good filtered or spring water 2 use a finely ground good coffee such as illy 3 pack it just slightly in the filter 4 do n't try to rush it by turning the heat up too high 5 never put it in the dish washer we have been using the organic espresso blend from whole foods and it is almost as good as the illy all in all this is easier and faster than most coffee makers and gives us a nice two servings of espresso in the morning add a little milk if you like but it 's also great straight out of the pot
i have used this model of bialetti coffee maker for years this is the exact model my dad used when he showed me how to make cuban coffee coffee is very similar to italian espresso both are made from espresso beans but is sweeter and stronger the manufacturer includes an instruction booklet but if you 've never made coffee before it could be a little confusing at first buy yourself a stainless steel creamer and a set of espresso cups add four heaping teaspoons of sugar to the creamer follow the instructions in the booklet to make the coffee when the coffee finishes brewing add two teaspoons of coffee to the creamer stir the coffee and sugar together until it forms a consistency similar to mousse it will be dark at first but will lighten as you mix it now add the rest of your coffee to the creamer and stir until all the sugar dissolves pour immediately into the cups and serve you should have enough to fill two cups the coffee will form a nice thick head on it just like a pint of guinness enjoy !
this is your basic italian single shot espresso maker for the stovetop i used practically the same model for almost a year while in florence i 'm tracking down some killer illy dark coffee to run through this puppy and am salivating until i can find a can it works very well this unit produces a very small amount of very strong coffee about the same as a single espresso from that corporate giant in seattle the keys to success are 1. fill water no higher than the nut pressure relief valve on the side of the bottom section and 2 use only low to medium at most heat to keep it from boiling over yum
i 've been using this every day since i received it over a month ago it works perfectly it 's more than paid for itself with the savings of not running out for a latte and it makes a great cup i ca n't say enough good about it
great coffee maker you have to be very attentive during the brewing process so you remove the maker from the stove as soon as the coffee is ready also never carelessly place it on the stove where the plastic handle is above a flame
i love this product ! it makes the perfect amount of espresso to start my day off right it 's easy to set up and easy to clean my only complaint is that the rings of these espresso makers wear out too quickly
the product is as sdvertized and is very simple to use i am not a coffee connisseur but i do enjoy a good espresso it has never been bitter or burned i am very pleased with this product
a this little cheap device makes wonderful coffee b it 's termed a 3 cup '' because italians generally drink this coffee in small cups serving size two sips
fortunately ours did n't break during shipment i am not too crazy about this pattern but still bought this set just it was the best one available in my price range they are quite heavy a bit too heavy for everyday use and will last a long time i really like the large bowl and especially the design of the lids ! the lids are so light and easy to grab place and remove the flat design makes it easy to store in your fridge which to me is a big plus over those bulky traditional corningware glass lids
item looked nice in the store so i ordered it from similar to what another reviewer mentioned the items arrived broken return was not a problem but because of the fragile nature of these itrems you would be better off buying this at a local store
i like the other lady ordered the textured leaves products i ordered two each of the rectangle baking dish and two sets of ramekins and one each of the bowl set and the covered all were shipped in perfect condition and the shipping was free via amazon i plan to order more pieces the product itself is quite heavy and study i was amazed by the weight of the pieces i look forward to using the new additions to my textured leaves dishes and cookware thanks
i 've had my step savor for several months now and i am very happy with it the griddle accomodates four pancakes and the small lip around the edge keeps the batter off my countertops the skillet gets hot enough to brown hamburger meat and has enough capacity to prepare a substantial main dish for a family of the temperature control has temperature markings for both the griddle and the skillet since the skillet temperature runs lower than the griddle is easier than with traditional electric skillets you do n't need to worry about immersing the electrical components because the skillet lifts off the base which is the griddle and can be washed like any cookware the griddle wipes clean with a paper towel or damp sponge though i 'm not much for home entertaining i can imagine this electric skillet being very handy you can cook in it then turn the temperature down to keep the food warm for as long as you need to the lid has an adjustable vent in it to control the moisture level inside i only wish that the coating was a bit tougher i 've been careful to avoid scratches so far but i know it 's only a matter of time i just hope that keeps making these clever kitchen tools because when this one becomes unusable i 'll certainly buy another one
i bought this for my boyfriend and i to use in the tiny 360 sq cottage that we live in i love that it 's both a skillet and a griddle or a skiddle '' so we get maximum function in the smallest package we 've already used it to make pancakes sausage links eggs chicken and some delicious cheese crisps it heats up fast and is very easy to clean it 's the perfect size for cooking for two people and is designed to that it does n't take up more counter space than it needs to i would highly recommend this
i think this combo is fantastic i use mine almost every day the only problems that i have encountered are once i dropped it while putting it away and part of the plastic base broke off this has made it more difficult to pick up but it still works fine and it was an accident also the nonstick coating has been scratching lately it does get a lot of use but i was hoping that it would last longer i am planning to buy another one though
the hamilton beach is the perfect griddle to use on a regular basis even heat easy to clean and takes very little space
the fry pan is easy to use and clean the skillet part is easy to remove when heated and also stores well in the provided tray holder we use it every day what a wonderful machine ! ! !
the step savor performs excellent i love it ! i highly recommend it
our family has purchased 7 of these cookers it does not stick and maintains temperature perfectly it sits on top of my cooktop which i rarely use anymore a for every kitchen
we were somewhat skeptical about buying a dual purpose but after using found it to be the best ! we use the griddle all the time and like the deep skillet that provides for cooking large roasts
this works well you do have to adjust the oven temp for the darker pan i was worried about using non tools on it but it did not scratch
my girlfriend could n't be more excited that i found her a pink coffee mug it seals real well and the insulation is great it is too tall for her cup holder but at least it does n't spill when it falls over one major warning do n't put this in the dishwasher or let it soak '' in hot water just fill with warm soapy water and sponge clean the outside otherwise the air seal around the mug sucks in the water and holds onto it when you go to fill it with hot coffee then the water all squirts out on your counter honestly if it was n't pink i would steal this from my girlfriend when she was n't looking there is a blue and red one out there for 7 more
the lodge is a very heavy skillet it is almost 15 '' on the inside and requires a large burner for heating howver it does cook very evenly clean up is simple just make sure you have a large enough space for storage
this pan lives up to the high quality i 've come to expect from lodge
i am absolutely sold on cast iron i have 4 different size skillets plus covered casserole fryer dutch oven i really enjoy using this giant one pick your size for your crowd i it in a 350 degree oven for stove top cooking i bake coffee cakes corn bread and fritta 's in it it 's roomy for grilling sandwiches i have also broiled and oven fried '' meats in this skillet i love to bake one pot meals casseroles from cheese to rice in the dutch ovens wet roasting is nice too but the pots do need to be after i agree with two other reviews 1 clean up while still hot on the burner 2 no tomatoes ! acidic foods destroy the seasoned coating making gravy in these pans really cleans them up i will never need '' to buy another set of cookware !
this skillet was purchased to use outdoors with butane heat excellent heat retention and distribution allows even cooking and browning being over 15 '' in diameter it will also fit across two electric cooktop elements on the range inside using both heating elements also allows for even cooking inside
the only thing it lacks is a lid lodge seems to make a lid for everything but this pan
i purchased this item based on other reviews and i am not sorry i made the purchase for several reasons i love lodge cast iron amazon has the best prices anywhere and free shipping however i was taken aback by the size of this skillet it is huge ! i tried it on my gas range and it takes up the front and the back burners but adjustments are needed to keep the sides from burning if it is used on just the front burner the larger burner the flame is directed to the middle of the pan but there is so much skillet left over that the outer edges never get really hot i would think the skillet which i just purchased also would make a more reasonable purchase becuase it is between a 12 which might be too small and the 15 which is toooooo big
this farberware millennium ss set which i received as a gift this past christmas has totally won my heart over and i would not hesitate to buy more from this series or even buy these as gifts for others i 've been using my set nearly every day since january and they have made me a very happy woman in the kitchen for one this attractively designed set has stayed nearly as pretty as the day i unpacked them from their box thanks to the smart lip design around the rims liquids do n't haphazardly drip down the sides burn and stain the pots or pans this also makes them easier to keep clean i 've also received compliments on how attractive my cookware set is i like that ! two the handles work great not only is it easier on the hands they also make it easy to handle your cookware without potholders every single time yes they do grow very warm and uncomfortable at times but nothing that i 've experience that can cause injury now i have n't used my pans in the oven so i can not speak for that type of scenario but for my every day gas stove top uses they 've kept their cool three they cook great ! ! ! i 've never been a fan of stainless steel in the past but that 's all changed now that i have this farberware set this set works efficiently enough to avoid having to use high heat all the time i get better results working with lower heats now it took a bit of a curve with my cooking initially but once i got the gist of it i had no problems working with stainless steel ss and my meals come out to my expectations four easy cleanup i used to believe that ss was such a pain to keep clean but once i learned to cook properly with ss cleanup is not such a hassle that i thought it would be also this cookware set easily cleans up in the dishwasher and it does n't ruin their external appearance i 've also hand washed my farberware millennium pots and pans plenty of times without much effort they truly clean up quite easily but with one exception eggs ! ! ugh ! i 'm sticking to teflon pans for those while i do love my farberware millennium set it does n't 100 fit all my needs so i do have a select few other pots and pans i 've kept from my old collection of cookware like i mentioned before i keep a small skillet for cooking eggs i also keep a couple of saucepans to accommodate my steamer the narrow design of the farberware set keeps me from using the smaller saucepans for that purpose and what kitchen would be complete without a set of skillets but for the most part my ss millennium set is my main workhorse cookware set that i use nearly every day with pleasure who knew that one did n't have to spend to have a great cookware set that acts like you spent i originally planned on getting another high end set but now that i have my farberware set i truly do n't feel that i need to look any further for my cookware needs i will gladly buy more from this series if need be i 'm very very pleased what prompted me to finally write a review for my 10 pc farberware millennium soft touch stainless steel set i recently finished hand washing my smaller ss skillet and was tickled to see it looking so great after so many uses i just had to sing it 's praises on amazon
i bought my farberware millenium set nearly 2 years ago they clean up really well and look pretty much like the day i got them no problems with the dishwasher at all ! the silicon grips are my favorite feature aside from being stainless steel they make it so much easier to cook and not have to grab pot holders all the time i 'm a person that is clumsy with hot pots so this was perfect the handles are really sturdy too i grew up in a home with the farberware classic series and the plastic handles on those would always come loose and have to be tightened a screwdriver this has n't been the case with the millenium i really would like to buy some more to expand my set in the future these were an amazing price for what i got highly recommended
i was very pleased with the 10 piece cookware set it really heats evenly and cleans up easily
decided to buy new pans for me and give old set to my daughter going away to college i did a lot of research before purchasing amazon had the best price and free shipping ! i wanted stainless steel lids as opposed to glass ones so that was a plus for this set the silicone covered handles are wonderful this is a heavy duty set and cooks and cleans up beautifully the only change i would make is to substitute a 12 inch skillet for the two smaller ones this set contains
i have owned a variety of cookware from skillets to porcelain pots almost all have frustrated me to some extent but to be fair i am not a '' chef in the kitchen i thought long and hard about how to get the best value for replacements out of a limited budget i dreamed of brands made from stainless or copper but i had to be reasonable one day in desperate need for a new teflon skillet i noticed a farberware millennium on sale at a local shop and i liked the feel of it i took it home and liked it enough to buy an omelet pan a few weeks later a on i needed a more comprehensive rennovation of my cookware and my experience and research led me to this stainless millenium set i could n't be happier with my purchase the feel is substantial but not too heavy for slinging around the kitchen eases the burden too it heats extremely well quickly and evenly on my electric stove i handwash the new set but even my teflon millennium pans look pretty darned good after repeated dishwasher cycles in hard water for new and experienced cooks on a budget i strongly recommend the millennium stainless
i have had these pots and pans for over a year now and am still very pleased with their performance i did have to learn to cook differently when using stainless steel with encapsulated bottoms people need to understand that hard water will cause discoloration on stainless but using barkeepers friend will remove any marks i love the soft handles and never have to worry about them being hot highly recommend these pots and pans
i ordered millinnium soft touch stainless on a saturday it arrived the following is beautiful perfect weight and love the heat proof handles and lids had to try it out so i fried a hamburger then put the pan in warm soapy water and let it soak came clean without any elbow grease i did some research on several brands including all clad too expensive cuisinart and costco 's kirkland farberware is just as good as far as composition my son is a professional chef and he recommended farberware to me i did need to adjust my cooking temperature only medium and low i have a ceramic cook top and the cookware works fine on it i am very pleased i only wish there would have been a larger skillet 10 inches is a little small other than that i would recommend this cookware to anyone it has a life time guarantee and the price is great
a 10 '' pan is my preferred size when i am just cooking for my wife and myself and this ltd pan is phenomenal i have never used a better or more expensive ! pan i have given it five stars because it was a gift and i did n't have to pay for it if i had the rating may have suffered since for that price it should probably make coffee and take out the trash as well a couple notes 1 if you maintain the surface consistently it is as easy to clean as i like to use bar keeper 's friend 2 it requires a few minutes ' if you are used to thinner pans you will need to give it some extra time 3 this pan cooks more evenly than i thought was actually possible you do n't even realize how uneven your old pans are until you try one of these 4 i wanted the ltd for its rugged good looks '' the other pans perform basically the same so if you do n't like the dark exterior go for one of those
when choosing this pan i was a bit concerned that it might tip over easily or do not heat well at the edges but it turned out to be simply fantastic even on the cheap electric stove from hell that 's installed in our apartment this pan keeps perfectly heated and balanced the size is enough for exactly 4 slices of bread which means now i can make french toast or grilled cheese sandwich twice faster than on a round pan and save time and electricity
we have allclad ltd but when our old electric griddle died we picked up one of these it 's such a luxury to have flip food so easily compared to a regular fry pan i actually look for excuses to make eggs pancakes grilled cheese etc on this griddle
this is a great pan easy to you can practically wipe it clean with a dry paper towel it is extremely durable i have about pieces of ltd in my collection this is my first piece of to add to my collection my husband is a and he loves these pans i would take 's advice and only preheat pan to medium heat it is a quality piece and distributes heat fast and thoroughly the pan only cost 49.99 with free shipping thru amazon what a deal other 's had it priced between 50 120 plus shipping also shipping only took about five days when they said it would take 10 14 days
my son recommended this griddle as he had purchased one and liked it i am satified
i have never written a review for anything before but just had to for this great griddle everytime i get it out i comment to my husband how much i love it ! this is perfect if you make pancakes eggs french toast or grilled cheese as much as i do nothing sticks to it and it is an absolute breeze to clean
for the single household i think is a wonderful griddle pan perfect for making french toast grilled cheese and tuna melt sandwiches cheese quesadillas and pancakes the heat from a gas range transfers through the pan quickly and pretty evenly the surface is a breeze to clean and the handle is sturdy i do n't use it for any dish that requires a greater amount of oil or butter because of the low lip but that 's fine by me at 11 square inches it 's too small to use for parties but on the other hand it is easier to carry and store unlike the 20 by grande griddle i am amazed how often i use it simply for the convenience as it is this is a highly recommended piece of cookware to add to your collection
great pan ! it makes cooking fun again ! super and very heavy duty lifetime warranty but i do n't think i 'll be needing it for a long time the only thing i do n't like is that the sides are too short
this axis ice bucket will last forever it is top quality and the right size for the real world
the box that my tree came in was falling apart so i needed a new way to store it for the next season i originally saw a christmas tree storage bag on another website and i think it was advertised for 15 but when i went back to get it it was gone thank goodness and i searched on amazon and ended up finding this bag at a much better price the bag is huge my tree is only 7 feet tall and there is a ton of room left over in the bag not to mention the handles on the bag make it super easy to move around i am a small woman 5 ' 4 '' and i had no problem picking up the bag to move it to storage when usually i have to have my husband do all that i would definitley get this bag if you are looking for one
it is bulky and akward to transport will not hold up for years to come i knew this getting into it you can tell by the photo that it 's cheap plastic material good as a for now '' fix
i use my bags to store all the linens and things we remove from our boat when we put it into winter storage it keeps everything together dry and dust free i 'm buying 3 more to use when we move my daughter out of her college dorm a lot more versatile than plastic bins
this tree bag will fit a tree or if you have two ! very roomy i still have alot of room to fill in mine seems to be a pretty good bag that will hold up as long as you do n't drag it because it 's too heavy once you fill it !
we recently purchased this to store an 8 foot christmas tree the material is heavyweight tarp '' type material and seems adequate the handles are well sticked on and the opening is wide enough to make getting the tree in and out easy overall what we expected
we ordered 2 of these so we could store our tree pieces across a couple of bags and make easier great product
it was a lot bigger than i anticipated but it works just like it should
at less than 5 you do n't get much but what you get works look at dimensions 60 '' long it wo n't fit a 5 ' tree or larger tree since the bag is only 5 ' and the zipper takes another foot away due to it 's side entry vs being at an end buy 2 and store your tree in two bags it worked for me only after i had to cut the bag a little more to fit the bottom 2 sections to my tree
this storage bag is everything i expected and at a great price it is sturdy and protects the tree i was orginally going to store the tree in the box supplied but was unable to keep it closed and it was ripping i did not want to spend a lot of money on a cloth bag and was trying to figure out what separated the others based on features and price points nothing stood out and decided on the lowest price the quality is good although i would recommend taking care loading the tree and moving the loaded bag it is n't cloth another advantage would be because it is not cloth the bag is easily wiped down dust build up etc
i 've got two little ones a 2 year old boy and a 3 year old girl my first worry after reading many of the reviews was that most who seemed to be having success had cats under a year old well i 'm about 3 weeks in and so far they are adapting nicely the instructions in the kit stated to put the litterbox by the toilet for a week then just take it away and put the citikitty kit on the toilet well after a day of some panicked looks and panicked meowing i decided to take a step back i put the thing on the floor and started raising it a few inches every few days i 'm happy to say that we just graduated to putting it straight on the toilet ! i 'm taking much longer than the kit recommends at each step as i am very determined to make this work so i 'm sure they appreciate that as well downside my bathroom has never looked worse there is litter flung and tracked everywhere but i would go through that for a year if i had to in order to ensure the next 15 years would be litter free ! another downside is as others have stated there is no going back in steps ones the holes are punched i think i will be cutting my own much more gradually than the perforated ones i think the holepunching process is what will make or break this deal ! but as i said i 'll go as slow as i have to i 'll check back in a few weeks with an update
we live in new york city and have two cats younger cats 18 months and about a year old needless to say it would be really nice if we could rid ourselves of the litter box forever we had originally purchased a cat system from another company it was not nearly as good as this one in fact it was a total failure flimsy plastic and you could n't punch out the insert gradually like you can this one at this point we are almost there we have punched out about half of the insert and the cats are acually perching on the toilet seat and aiming for the hole just incredible we are very happy ! the plastic is strong and easy to clean
sturdy plastic handles my 12 lb cat easily not for someone who is n't ready to do the training steps you will have to share the bathroom with the cat move the citykitty every time you need to use the toilet clean up misses '' that catch the seat and keep the seat down and lid up to make the transition we started by putting her self scooping litter box on a platform next to toilet then we moved her litter to the citykitty we also used about and inch of litter so we did n't scare her as the first week progressed no holes punched we transitioned to the flushable litter having two bathrooms is a plus we just opened the first hole only in 1. this way if she protests she has an acceptable option suggest a container of those disinfecting wipes sometimes she misses '' and catches the seat she also still likes to bury and gets litter on seat and tracks it around floor the little swiffer vac is getting a lot of use however anyone with a litter box already has to deal with tracked litter i keep reminding myself it will be worth it in the end
we have two little monsters and found out quickly that it is best to separate the two during training it is a good thing we have two bathrooms if you have multiple cats another thing you might consider is that it can be much easier once your kittens are spayed or neutered we started with a litterkwitter the litter kwitter costs more but has insert rings with variable sized holes that are switched as your cat progresses this makes it reusable and gives you the ability to back up if your cat is not ready for the next stage the citikity has rings once you go to a stage there is no going back and when your cat is trained you throw the citikitty away however you can break out stages making it possible to make the initial step from full pan to pan with a hole in it less tramatic that is one drawback with the litterkwitter the first stage with a hole was a big jump for our cats 4 stars because 1 it is not reuseable and 2 i think the 29.99 price tag is a bit steep for a toilet seat sized piece of relativly thin plastic drop that price to 19.99 and it would get my 5 stars because you can breakout stages i would choose this over the litterkwitter
i have 2 cats and they are 8 months now i started them on the citty kitty about 2 months prior and so far its great i was fortunate to have already placed their litter boxes in the bathroom so drawing them from that to the toilet was easy for my cats it seems they follow the litter they also love to on fresh litter especially after i cleaned and replaced it SMILE i bought 2 training cats for the 2 toilets i have in my house and they use both of them well once i placed the kits on the toilets and poured fresh litter on it they were ready to use it i am on the last 3 rings and am confident they will have no problems it looks like now they are working their aim into the actual toilet and scraping as much litter in the hole the only thing i suggest is if your cat likes a clean litter ensure you clean the kit daily my male cat got pist one time and pee 'd in the corner of the bathroom thats the only time any of them made mistakes '' punching holes can be a mess too suggest getting disposable gloves also sometimes your cat may miss or splatter or what have you i bought a bunch of those cleaning wipes for the bathroom so that before anyone uses the toilet they can wipe off any excess litter or splashes and toss it in the toilet lastly learn your kitty 's bathroom routine last thing you need is both of you showing up at the bathroom ready to go
this is one of the best investments i have made for the kitchen with this pan you can make seared scallops so tender and succelent it will make you feel like a professional chef i also grill vegetables of all kinds on this pan with a little bit of olive oil for a delicious and side or main dish you will not be disappointed
what a great deal this was the grill pan was less than half price and the two oven mitts are a terrific bonus macy 's shipped this almost immediately and it arrive very quickly
the stovetop popcorn popper is incredible the popcorn is the best tasting ever ! i use 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a half cup of popocorn and this popper pops every kernel in just a few minutes time on the stove the crank on the popper is a little squeaky but like i said the popcorn is awesome after using the popper it is very easy to clean i just wipe it out with a paper towel and then put it back in storage i would highly recommend this popper to anyone who is a popcorn lover
i use my whirley pop every day i bought a 50 lb bag of popcorn from sams as my niece suggested i go to weight watchers so this method of making popcorn works very well for my diet the popcorn tastes so much better than
this is the best popcorn popper ever ! it 's easy really fast and fun every kernel pops up light and fluffy we used the movie theater packs and we think the popcorn tastes better than what we get at the movies we also popped a store bought corn and it also popped up light and fluffy with no kernels unpopped we are not fans of microwave popcorn and we usually popped in a pot on the stove the makes a better popcorn and is so much faster and easier because of the material it is made of and the way the steam is vented we love it and never have a problem eating the full batch
i absolutely love this popper it makes the best popcorn i have ever eaten and the flavor is just like theatre popcorn it is easy to use and pops up the corn very fast and is easy to clean i would recommend this product to anyone who likes popcorn i will never go back to microwave popcorn again ! ! !
requires a lot of turning on the handle but worth it for that old fashioned movie type popcorn ! i recommend for family fun
good quality pans however if you want a crispy bottom you wo n't get it unless you take the pizza off the pan and place directly on the oven rack good for homemade crusts though
i have three sizes of these skillets i love all of them you cook without oil the clean up is great every thing is cooked on med to low heat they are wounderful i would tell anyone to buy them
we know have 2 10 inch analon titanium skillets we like them all very much we had some earlier analon skillets and they are very good but the titanium series is better an earlier anolon skillet still is but is starting to lose something the titanium does not seem to be losing it great skillets
heats super evenly works fantastic dishwasher safe as long as you use the right detergent it does n't get any better than that
i first discovered analon titanium restaurant tested fry pans in macy 's they only had an 8 inch model which i purchased as it is perfect for making a personal omelet they are heavy gauge aluminum clad in titanium on the bottom and have completely steel handles unlike the lower grade of analon which look very similar but have silicone rubber handle grips as such the metal handles are much better for popping a meal into the oven after initially it on the stove the nonstick coating is very high grade as well
i just love my analon titanium cooks evenly goes in the oven excellent nonstick and has the world 's most comfortable handles if you 're like me handles dig into your hands painfully these handles nestle stably in your palms
the knife set is absolutely fantastic ! the knives are razor sharps feel great in the hand and ring like a tuning fork when sharpened they look feel and cut like quality they hold an edge far longer than i expected staying sharp for weeks between honing on the sharpening steel they are a little heavy in the hand but very well balanced i highly recommend them the best knives i 've ever owned
i really am truly satisfied with this product the dimmension where it set up is different at top and bottom due to the base boards the gate can adjust for this and is just as secure i also like the fact that i found less expensive then ordering it from the manufacturer
between basset hounds and babies we have had too many gates to count not only was this gate easy to install but it is also incredibly sturdy this gate has been working marvelously for over a year and we are now replacing all of our pet gates with this model this is definitely the gate to have
the richell 94118 adjustable pet gate with wood finish is awesome i 'm so glad i paid the extra money the gate is actually wood and metal it is sturdy and relatively easy to assemble the gate swings both ways and is easy to open and close
good gate and the wood finish looks well with house decor easy to use with one hand a little hard to install in doorway and the piece at the bottom can cause a tripping hazard would be better if the bottom rail was lower profile or if the bottom was wider and angled on both sides as a ramp so that you do n't trip over it we have all hit our toes and tripped going through this door you will trip or hit your foot if you do not go slow and raise your feet
worth every penny it is truly a beautiful pet gate with class goes well with wood floors and you can not purchase this in a pet store wonderful price and free shipping i will definitely purchase more things from amazon
loved the look of this gate even nicer in person when people walk in they say what a beautiful gate '' it matches all of our woodwork and nobody can believe it is n't screwed into the doorframe very sturdy excellent value if i ever had to purchase another gate i would n't even consider any other kind
i highly recommend this gate it looks great you can see ours from our front door and we get compliments on it all of the time the door also swings very smoothly it is also easy enough for the kids to close properly as we have had other gates in the past that were difficult to close
i love this gate it is really good looking and does n't take away from my decor i highly recommend it !
it 's a gate for the money it also functions very well and is adjustable just be sure that you measure your doorway and put it together using the correct hardware configuration for your doorway 's size
i 've had this for almost 2 years and it 's a great little crockpot '' i 've put several dips in this over the time i 've owned it and the only hassle is the cleanup as mentioned in another review the unit is one piece so you ca n't submerse it in water other than that i love having this for holiday entertaining when i only want to keep a small amount of a dip constantly warm although i believe it 's 12.99 at bed bath and beyond
the only reason this does n't get 5 stars is the fact that you can not take out the pot you also can not immerse this in water so cleaning is a giant pain that said it 's great for dips that need to be kept warm such as my famous 'chile con queso ' just put everything together and plug it in a few hours before a party cut a 4 '' block of velveeta into 1 '' cubes put in the lil ' dipper add a few tablespoons of medium pace picante add of a small can of chopped green chiles for more spice dribble in the juice from a jar of jalapenos to thin it out you can add cream half and half or milk or even water but that will dull the taste serve with your favorite torilla chips you can also make this in the microwave if you need to make something 'in a hurry ' i would n't recommend putting this on a dining table as you 'd need an extension cord and kids could trip over it and burn themselves heck i guess at some parties adults could too ! but a buffet or counter against the wall would be fine
great for heat coming from the bottom and sides of the crock does a better job of keeping dips warm than a pot with the heat source on the bottom only compact so that it does n't take up too much space on the table needs a few minutes to warm up and you might need an extension cord in order to have it on the table
my wife japanese was pissed when i ordered this she thought a stone would work best she was very surprised and happy after trying it however it 's a fine sharpener and easy to use price is right recommended
i got this a couple of days ago because my chef 's knife was starting to squash tomatoes rather than cut through them sharpening both the chef 's and a vegetable knife following the directions i was pleasantly surprised when they each sliced through the paper towels i was using to dry them off i finished the sharpening with a steel and am very happy with the results i have n't done anything to the blades but use the steel after each use since i bought the knives and am jazzed that this little guy brought my blades back to life i know there was some negative reviews of the blades but keeping the blades perpendicular and not pushing down to hard i got a good edge i think if you push down too hard you put the blade edge flat on the wheel and grind off the edge which would make the knife duller keep it perpendicular so it puts wheels faces against the blades faces and it will give you what you are looking for but of course a professional sharpening from someone who has been doing this type of thing for years would produce an amazing edge probably for about the same cost as this little baby
i read the reviews below and saw that there were a few bad ones and then mostly positive one i decided to give this sharpener a try when i got it one of the wheels was n't on its tracks and so i just popped it into place filled the sharpener with water and directed and started sharpening my knives it has made my two global 's razor sharp and another knife almost as sharp i decided to give them the real test and took them to work sushi chef they worked so well sliced through everything i think for anyone that needs a fast effective sharpening tool this is a good choice
what are other people are doing to their globals with this sharpener mine works extremely well and makes my very sharp in a matter of a few minutes trust me i am as bad a knife sharpener as anyone could be in fact this sharpener is part of the reason i bought my global in the first place i can only guess that using a light even stroke and making sure that the knife is straight up and down in the sharpening slots is important to the sharpening technique also the sharpener does n't work on many knives because of the weird bevel global edges have so do n't think it 's going to work on your wustof unless you have a professional the bevel to a buy one follow the directions and you and your globals will be very happy
i 'm not sure how people are banging up their knives using this simple effective sharpener slow down folks take your time i own a number of global knives and sharpen them all using the minosharp with tremendous success i 've even had luck sharpening henckel and wusthof knives with this i enjoy using it and when i 'm done my knives are like new
i 've only had the product for a short time but it 's definitely making a noticeable change on the edge of my global knives i 'm rather impressed
this was a very nice knife sharpener it was easy to use and it provided a very nice sharpness to the blade main points easy to use provides an effective sharp blade within a few minutes
my cat absolutely loves this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! she was glued to the tv the entire run time of the dvd you must try this dv
our cat was mesmerized by this video at the very beginning she did n't pay much attention but then the video showed a cardinal and her ears perked up and her eyes grew big as saucers ! she was hooked ! mostly she sat in front of the tv with her eyes glued to the screen ! about five times she actually tried to climb up to the tv ! she will enjoy this and we shall enjoy watching her
my cat loves this dvd just do n't use with a flat panel unless it 's behind glass as your cat may attack the screen
i like it the shaped tongs help in gripping heavier things as opposed to a smooth tong end it was worth the purchase
these are the tongs every cook bbqer needs they are chef quality throw away all the others that do n't really grab '' anything and slide from side to side from picking up a thick steak or one thin spear of aspargus this is a tool you need
i highly recommend it i 've never had any problems with it measurements are accurate there is really no need to put it in the microwave and if the product inside is too hot you can use oven mitts a very practical durable and sturdy kitchen tool
this excellent kitchen tool has metric conversions right next to the us measurements which makes it a perfect item for the international very affordable and durable its shape makes it really easy to hold and handle with bare hands using a real stove to heat your liquids in a pan the good old fashioned way eliminates any risks '' of getting scalded
item arrrived on ahead of time and in good conditions at a great low price
roomy sturdy well made and attractive i am very pleased with this item it exactly matches my ocean breeze place settings
i love these canisters the best i have ever owne
i love this set it will look lovely as a decorator piece on my counter tops
this little chopper does wonders it chops nuts and veggies like a much bigger chopper it 's super sturdy i keep all of my walnuts etc in the freezer to keep them fresh and this chopper chops the frozen nuts wonderfully i was leary at first hanging on to my old crank nut chopper handed down from my husbands mother it did n't take me long to toss the old one away i just love this chopper and use it for all my cooking needs a wonderful purchase at a wonderful price
i purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms she finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck
i should know i have bought it twice now ! i started off buying the cheap ones but they are ugly i walked out of the room while heating water by the time i came back it was completely stuck to the burner my fault i then decided to buy a nice tea kettle bought the le creuset larger one really loved it but it was just so big i seem to be the only one who makes tea so i did n't need the big one the 1 quart demi kettle is teh right size for one to two people and you can have several cups of tea from it i use it to heat up water add it to the coffee grinds in my coffee press i finally bought this one love it ! ! it 's perfect for me looks nice on the stove when not in use i did have to buy another when i burned this one on the stove as well it did n't melt away on the stove but the enamel did start to chip but i loved this one so much that i immediately set out to find the exact same one i abslutely love it and i am being much more careful to not leave the room when i have the stove on SMILE i am a firemans nightmare
as long as you have the proper lighting these bulbs will flourish mine have grown beautifully and they were all different kinds some purple some green with very different leaves one of them even had small white flowers it 's so much cheaper than buying plants and also you wo n't get snails or other unwanted pests accidentally i have goldfish in my tank so i grew these in a area so they wo n't eat them completely on me they grew fine in an aquarium at room temperature
i love these things ! within 2 to 4 days after placing these into my aquarium most of the bulbs had started growing roots after planting in the gravel as instructed they began sprouting leaves there were different plant varieties in my package they grow very fast and look great i use a fluorescent bulb on a timer for 9
this is a wonderful inexpensive little space heater that functions perfectly for my needs office it 's unfortunate that this item has received so many poor reviews but i feel that 's mainly the result of operator error the timer function seems to be stumping quite a few people if you purchase this heater and have trouble after reading the enclosed instructions simply read the review things you should know before buying '' from november 4 2006 everything is explained very clearly
i bought this for my daughters bedroom that has no heating at all i live in ny and it has been extreemly cold this winter it keeps her room very warm a great little heater
i love this heater it has several safety and convenience features i actually could n't figure out how to get it working though a helped the instructions were n't well written however there is an 800 number on the bottom for customer serice i would strongly recommend it 's a great value
after using this heater for a few weeks i 've found it to be a good value and a good product it distributes heat evenly through the area we need heated and has features that are quite easy to use it was good choice
excellent solution to the odor that occurs during the of the cartridge
i love my cat but detested the cat box after reading the reviews i bought this and it is the best buy of the year ! no smell my cat took to it right a way after i ordered i bought a box of the crystal litter and put it on top of her litter by the time this box came in she was ready ! no smell and it last over the suggested 30 days almost makes me want to get another cat
this is a wonderful product that saves so much time as far as cleaning out cat litter boxes on a very regular basis as a person with a bad back and shoulders it is ideal our cats became used to it very quickly which was also a bonus they seem entranced when the cleaning mechanism goes back and forth which is funny to watch i really would recommend this to owners i have just realised i am giving an all around review which i am sorry for the hood is great for the privacy that people cats and everyone neeed
we bought one for all three of the litter boxes we got we were afraid that our kitties would not like the open boxes they love the privacy the hoods offer and it also gives a finish look to the scoop free box i urge anyone who buys the litter box to purchase the hood
this would work better if it was more secure on the litter box it does a pretty good job keeping the litter in the box but my cat is pretty spazzy and knocks it off pretty easily maybe i 'm just not getting in on right though still it 's better than cleaning up all the litter he would spray everywhere without it
my only complaint is that amazon does not properly pack their products it took 3 attempts to get them here with out any damage ! the canisters are pretty and are able to hold a large amount of product
the product shipped great only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned the colors are great and the storage is good
these canisters were bought at a great price through amazon jcpenny wanted we waited a month for amazon to ship them and then when we got them the 2 big canisters were demolished in shipping so we sent them back and asked for them to send us another box we recieved these 4 days later and they too were cracked everywhere so we asked them to ship a new box and if they were broken then we 'd go somewhere else and sure enough the box was intact and is sitting on our counter top with sugars and flour in them
i love the capability that can be transferred from a microwave to an oven i use it primarily for my frozen crab cake that i microwave it first for couple minutes then move it to an oven to finish cooking with crisp textures
i have had the more travel mugs and thought that they were the best well i was wrong this travel mug is by far the best out there it is truly my friends get tired of me turning it upside down i guess i 'm easily amused hehe but i really do like a mug that wo n't spill if tipped over when turned to the drink side the liquid flows at about the right rate not too fast not too slow anyway i ca n't say enough about this mug and the price also beats the competition i am not sure about the red color i have the blue and the black and i prefer the black out of the three choices
i love this plate ! ! i am actually waitng for the other 10 that i recently ordered my husband loves them becasue they are heavy duty and have a large eating space love the fact that they do n't chip and the paint does not wear off everyone that eats over my house comments on my dinnerware all fiesta
this plate is n't quite as big as i expected but i love it ! it is gorgeous and works well as a serving plate i have used it for serving garlic bread and quesadillas size is perfect for the big tortillas i usually buy so far i have the sunflower color and it is beautiful i look forward to purchasing more fiestaware !
i have about 20 chop plates i have most of the colors i use them for barbeque dinners and for italian meals they will hold the whole meal on one plate southern style they have enough space to keep messy foods separated with no need for separate side plates the standard dinner plates are too small stacked on open shelves with my other fiestaware pieces they give a burst of color to my neutral kitchen i started with my 's collection that was passed down to me the older plates are larger than the current style with mixed colors you can set the table to any color theme warning ! no one likes the pink one it 's the tongue plate '' the last person to the table gets that plate and it 's not unusual to see it sneakily moved from place to place after the table is set kids love to switch it around these plates are fun amazon has the best price on single plates
just received my cobalt tones chop plate it 's beautiful i plan to use it as a serving platter more than a plate i saw this listed on amazon last fall and put off ordering it when i decided it was a must have '' it was out of stock i tried other sites and could n't find cobalt tones anywhere i contacted the company to find a retailer and was told that it was exclusive to amazon ! however i have seen this pattern or something very close at tamarak outside beckley wv it is a west virginia sponsored open mall featuring crafts and products made in wv which fiesta is i was thrilled when it was back in stock it will give my fiesta table an even more creative look
i love this plate and it 's good for serving something like roast chicken but it 's too big for everyday use so it sits in my cupboard the rest of the time just know that this plate is big ! if you do a lot of serving it 's probably good for you but i only bring it out at thanksgiving holidays and large dinners with friends
this is a very versatile piece it really brightens up the table a must for fiesta collections i have extras that i use as chargers underneath other colored plates
they 're pillowcases they hold my pillows well good fabric and stitching comfortable
these pillowcases are very soft and comforting when you go to sleep yes they are a little slick but i use them with flannel sheets and we have no problems with them falling off the bed i have 8 pillows in these pillowcases and at the cheap price that they are i purchased 4 more in case something happens to one of them these are a great deal !
this pillows are so incredably soft i wished they had a zipper so they would not fall off that would make them perfect but they are still worth ever cent and more
these pillow cases are great nice color nice material when washed and dried they come out nice and smooth i would liked for them to be a little bit longer but the quality is great
these pillow cases are so soft to sleep on they 're large enough to fit a king size pillow so they 're a little large for my standard size worth the money
first of all the price was wonderful i was not expecting to purchase them for such a great price they sleep very well and they are lovley against my decor
these are very high quality of pillowcases i got as many as i could and in all different colors and sizes because i have twin queen and king size pillows at my house i did n't worry about colors white wine plum light blue taupe it really did n't matter what color case i put on because with such a variety it was easy too coordinate but nobody cares because they are so soft and you can change them every day in the heat when everybody is sweaty at night or for whatever reason it 's dirty they wash and dry just like new every time ca n't sleep better than with a fresh clean and soft pillowcase under your head at night
the plates arrived in good condition and are what i needed to complete my servic
this set is a great addition to my kitchen it 's functional and adds a great red accent to the countertop matching my other kitchenaid appliances i highly reccommend it
this kitchenaid cutlery set is a beautiful addition to my kitchen which is decorated using red and white appliances the cutlery set includes a variety of different size each perfect for chopping and slicing beauty and function together
i ordered from amazon the kitchenaid cook 's series cutlery set with traditional natural block red handles which is exactly the same as this set but cheaper the picture for the other set is wrong though because it shows polished handle ends for the steak knives but the handles are red plastic only and the handle ends for the other pieces are actually brushed steel and not polished as shown in the picture in essence the knife set that is pictured here is the knife set that you will also get if you purchase the other kitchenaid knife set that i 've mentioned above as far as the knives themselves the weight is perfect for chopping and the blades are nice and sharp the funky red color looks cute in my kitchen too the only negative is they 're not dishwasher safe but luckily they do clean easily by hand even though amazon is having a hard time correctly picturing the kitchenaid knife sets i 'm very satisfied with the set that i received and thrilled to finally have a knife set to be proud of
hey the thing opens cans i am not that picky as long as it works i am happy
buy one you and your cat will love it too good to be true and the price is fantastic !
i 've gone through so many cat collars over the years they either break mat my cat 's hair or he scratches at them until i worry he 'll hurt himself not with this one ! as soon as it arrived i slipped it over his head he had no idea and still does n't i 'd all but given up getting him to wear his tags due to the problems with other collars now thanks to this one his tags are where they belong i 'm so happy that i 'm thinking of ordering more to give them to all the cat lovers i know for christmas stocking stuffers this year
i bought three of these collars for my cats because we 're moving and i want them to have ids in the past i 've tried the wider collars with the safety snap when i put those on the cats would wiggle and squirm trying to get the collar off and with the safety snap they eventually unlatched them plus the width of other collars tends to mat the hair around their necks this collar so far is far superior two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head but once the safety collar was on they have n't thought twice about it they have n't tried to get them off or scratched at them it does n't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin the fur on their necks are n't suffering the sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use the colors are very vibrant i got mango orange maui blue and tulip red but unfortunately since my cats have long hair the color gets lost in their fur but that does n't take anything away from how much i love these collars if your not sure these are inexpensive enough to give a try ! if you need to put a collar on your cat i think these are one of the best options available
my brother and each got one as a gift about ten years ago i currently have both of them while they definately have some limitations the asthetics and ease of use balance them out reasonably reliable after 7 years of use and three years in a controlled the motor in one of them gave out i am ordering a replacement as soon as the marineland website comes back online if i were going to buy this myself i would instead opt for a traditional setup of seperate glass aquarium filter and hood you would get more for your money however if you want a sleek system that looks great and runs silent this will be a fine choice just be careful not to scratch the acrylic tank also instead of buying expensive filter cartridges i remove the blue filter and charcoal and use far cheaper boxed charcoal and fiberglass floss saves about 75 off the cost of the cartridges
this tank was purchased for my 5 year old i have a 10 gallon for myself and she wanted a seperate place for her snails this tank is awesome great price and comes with everything you need but the fish ! take the other readers advice on operation and just enjoy the only thing is the bio wheel can be a bit annoying when the water level is low but it may not be enough to bother most people would buy again
i have been using it for over a month and i love it the only disadvantage is that this tank is made of plexiglass which scratches more easily than glass so you have to be careful when you add gravel eclipse 6 has mechanical and chemical filtration plus biological filtration the mechanical and chemical filters are enclosed in one easily replaceable unit replacements can be found easily at your local petco or online cost about 3 per month the biological filter biowheel never needs replacement i replaced the light that this system comes with a hagen and plants grow fine under that light just remember to not add too many fish in the beginning it takes about 4 weeks for beneficial bacteria to establish on the biowheel until this happens the water will have too much ammonia which kills fish to kick start the bilogical cycle you have to add some fish add a couple of livebearers platy guppy molly etc but never goldfish the ammonia level will increase then go down after about 3 to 4 weeks after this you can add more fish
i have mixed feelings about this knife first of all according to the consumer report it does n't cut as well as the wusthof classic knives this size is great for me because i have very small space to prepare food and ca n't manage with the 8 '' chef 's kife because it is long
my dog really loves this bed i really like the idea of a 'cool side ' a 'warm side ' however the color is not what i would call 'moss ' but 'teal ' just fyi ! no complaints about the quality tho
has worked well with the crate we purchased to go with it wipes clean easily
this washable cedar bedding fits in the pet gear home 'n go soft sided pet crate and the manufacturers really should have included it with the crate do n't buy the crate without also purchasing this necessary padding the combo makes a great starter home '' for your new puppy
i had been mourning the passing of the visions line of cookwear for years now finally the line has returned and on i love these pots ! ! ! the ones that i have are over 20 yeears old and have suffered through teaching my 2 youngsters how to cook with only 1 pot being broken in a few years i will be teaching my grandson how to cook with these same pots the new pots are just as great as my original ones you have made me very happy by offering them again and over the internet
surprised to receive this cookie sheet with a recipe and statement that says that this sheet is great for making a jelly roll '' cake no way ! sheet doe not have sides to hold a batter ! nice size and weight cookie sheet and easy to wash
i really love these pans the size is small but that is not really a drawback because i can get 2 of them on one oven rack so they really give me more flexibility than a larger pan they still look brand new after about 6 months of use and clean up so easily ! i avoid nonstick '' coatings as they always end up peeling off and i am not convinced they are safe especially peeling and sometimes you have to live with some sticking that way but with a light greasing cookies slide right off these pans even without that yukky teflon coating that so many cookie pans have definitely a winner
i first tried the shun chefs knife and loved it this paring knife is great everything i want from a paring knife sharp comfortable just flexible enough and a great grip
we have several shuns and they are a cheaper alternative to hattori they are worth what you pay but not the best out there as some have declared they like other top japanese knives need to be sharpened at 12 to 15 degrees to get the best performance this negates their use for heavier use so a traditional 20 degree knife needs to be kept as well the spanish henckels or forschners do this well they are available for lefties too but you have to ask or special order them
i believe if you 're serious about cooking you should own great cookware and excellent knives i finally stepped up and got excellent knives for those who have n't heard the hype shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world check them out on the web at great features of the entire line include these cool d '' shaped handles that fit your hand better each knife is made in a and version for lefties the handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe ! ! the steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives the knives are extremely sharp cut myself day one one thing to note about asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle degrees 20 degrees for german knives the shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle this knife is light and just feels right in my small hands my old knife was 4 '' but the difference is n't that noticable to me this knife makes quick work of garlic it is so sharp that it seems like i just have to lay the knife against the food this is an expensive but lifetime investment i encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them for more info on shun check out alton brown 's website for ratings on various brands and types of knives check out ' equipment ratings this is probably the best kitchen purchase i 've made and the one i 'm most proud of
before i started doing any serious cooking i never quite saw the point of the 'big ' knives and ended up doing practically everything with a cheap stamped paring knife then i discovered the beauty of the chef 's knife and the rocking action you can use to make short work of veggie prep finally i discovered the sheer bliss of very sharp large knives starting with the great german brands and graduating to these new shun knives after my hero alton brown started shilling for shun and khershaw it was easy to forget the utility of a great little paring knife especially if it was just as sharp as its big brothers now that i 've gotten one of these little beauties i have come back to admiring its qualities without a very sharp paring knife jobs like cleaning and butterflying shrimp can be a real drag in that the flesh of the shrimp is so soft a dull knife wo n't even cut into it without really dangerous pressure or shear here 's a poster case for the dangers of dull knives as you are typically not pressing down on a nice firm cutting board you are usually cutting toward your thumb or index finger all lecturing aside if you do a wide range of cooking you may not use a paring knife often but when you do you will really appreciate having this little sharpie on hand
i agree with all of the accolades given to this paring knife by other reviewers it 's razor sharp and a work of art however it is designed for a right handed person which should n't be surprising given that it 's designed and made in japan as you may have guessed i 'm most people do n't realize how many products are designed for righties and the challenges this presents for lefties the asymmetry on this is n't so severe that i wo n't be able to use it largely because it is so small the d '' shape described in the product info is n't quite accurate there is a ridge running down the right side of the handle designed to fit in the crease of your hand that ridge hits the middle of my thumb when i hold the knife in my left hand this knife is great but i wo n't be able to get a larger version unless they do away with the pakkawood handle comfortable offset steel bolster '' or make a version
i have a whole set of these blades so i 'm breaking down my review to two parts review of the shun classic blades and the portion as it pertains to this knife in particular i absolutely love this knife and it 's my second most used knife my first most used is my work horse the shun ken onion 8 '' chef 's knife there are many small tasks that the paring knife is a must for though and that 's when i grab this one when you want to trim a nice piece of meat rib a green pepper etc you do n't want a big knife you need this little one it 's little but so sharp that it slices through anything like butter making prep work so easy and enjoyable shun knives are beautiful creations period since i 'm asian i love the tradition look and feel of this japanese knife i love the beauty of the blade and the dark polished pakkawood handle the unique d '' wood handles are preferable the shape fits my hand perfectly and the wood does not get slippery when wet providing a very secure hold the steel is of utmost quality and sharpness do not put this blade into any old electric knife sharpener ! electric knife sharpeners are made to put one angle on any blade these blades come with a 16 degree angle and you do n't want to be changing that angle there are electric knife sharpeners that can sharpen these knives but you 'll have to do some research and find out which ones can be a fit with these knives i prefer to hone with a sharpening steel and manually sharpen with a stone if necessary and i do n't see it being necessary to touch it to a stone any time soon the blade is sharp straight off the factory and as alton brown says it 's the sharpest straight out of the factory edge as he 's ever seen these knives are more expensive than most but i think it 's definitely worth it to have the sharpest most beautiful knife around it 's no contest if you are on a budget build your collection slowly it 's been said that there are only 3 knives that are the absolute basics for any kitchen a 8 '' chef 's knife a paring knife and a long serrated blade for cutting bread and larger items i would add a thin utility knife and a boning knife to that list next then i would add those '' sizes as i get more money flow in SMILE if you plan on spending any time in the kitchen good kitchen knives are a definite must preparation is the bulk of cooking and when you have good knives it cuts down on the danger of cutting yourself it adds pleasure to the work and it cuts down on prep time knives are also a very personal choice and it 's best to at least go to a store and try it out for yourself first shun knives are designed by the japanese so remember it 's designed for small hands this makes it fit most women 's hands perfectly but i 've heard of guys with larger hands not like it so much and going back to the german knives so definitely try it out it 's a personal thing it needs to fit you why spend so much money on a knife well if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen and you almost always have to bust out a knife to prep a meal from scratch why not use the best why spend that time with items that you love and brings you pleasure to use many times it 's the small things that brings us the most pleasure in life and i consider my shun knives as one of those things having something so beautiful and yet so sharp and perfect it makes my time cooking just that much more enjoyable another good thing to know is that although the shun knives are usually offered for you can get these knives for you just need to find the guys who stock and sell those ones as they are less known and less common
this is my second shun knife i fell in love with the knives after using my 10 '' chef knife for about 6 months while i use the chef 's knife for just about everything there are certainly times when accuracy and precision are important you just ca n't get the same results with a 10 '' chef 's knife as you can with a 4 '' pairing knife and so back to the chef 's store i went to try out this little bad boy it 's amazing how sharp these knives are out of the box just a few slides on a steel and the knife is back to peak performance while i own a ceramic sharpening device i still have n't had to use it on either knife this knife is absolutely perfect for any small task deveining shrimp peeling fruits or vegetables cutting tomatoes especially cherry tomatoes shaving asparagus you name it the only downside with this knife is its price while you can easily go out to the supermarket and buy a 10 oxo knife that will provide you with some good results i knew i had to get the shun after spending a little time with it at the store it makes all prep work so much easier and when combined with the 10 '' chef 's an experience that gets the exact results i wanted from fine cutlery go get it
i loved my 6 '' shun chef knife so much that i just bought two of these little knifelets one for my mother and one for me the razor thin edge tore through the bases of 4 day old asparagus like butter i am very very pleased will use this for tomatoes and everything else that requires a knife of manageable size plus for my mother who does n't take very good care of things in the kitchen these have the advantage of being dishwasher safe a huge bonus as the saying goes when you try a shun your german knives are
i love this storage system the revolving holder is flimsy but serves it 's purpose just fine i only wish i could find a way to specifice size containers every where i 've looked it seems i have to the whole set i need more of the conveniant containters
i have owned this system for and have never had one of the containers break it is a great space saver i got rid of all my old containers when i purchased this it is not a space saver if you keep all your old containers too ! okay i kept some 'big ' containers in an undercabinent space for the rarer occasion that i need them i love that the lids are interchangeable !
i really like this cookbook many of the recipes are based on a cake mix which you add additional items to there are pictures in the book but i am glad to have a book specifically of bundt cake recipes
i bought this set for a recent trip worked out great attractive unbreakable and practical
excellent item at a fantastic price ! holds up well wonderful to cook in and when you wash it it dries nice without spots highly reccommended cookware the helping hand on the frying pan is the 'icing on the cake'
i have a set of the traditional circulon as well as a piece of the new steel circulon i have never had a problem keeping the 'grooves ' clean i put my circulon in the dishwasher it 's very low maintenance food cooks great with it both my mother and have made positive comments about it when visiting i have never had the problems which the negative reviewer has made i recommend this brand highly
i just received this set of cookware and found it to be one of the best i have ever used i will keep them forever
i recieved the sango blue set for my wedding and needed more pieces if you really like the color blue you 'll love this the color is beautiful i needed a serving dish you can use this one for lots of different stuff it is a bowl but it couold be used a a plater with high sides it is wide and kind of flat so it has it is truley a must have for anyone who has lots of parties or family dinners
my husband and i had a hard time agreeing in a dinnerware set when we got married after a lot of discussion i thought we would never make it to the altar at this rate ! ! we finally settled on the sango nova blue pattern it is beautifully colored with just about every variation of blue from navy to royal to a beautiful sky blue in the glaze pattern we absolutely love the way it looks with so many subtle color variations it can coordinate in a million ways in one 's kitchen we also liked the fact that there were so many coordination bakeware and serveware pieces available too nothing looks nicer when you 're entertaining than a well coordinated table we have not regretted our decision yet
dyson dc 14 does the job well really impressed but then any new vacuum would do that i have to wait a few months to really know if it continues doing a good job
i was a little apprehensive after reading some customer experiences luckily my dyson arrived in perfect shape it was fairly easy to assemble the only weird thing is when you switch it on and have it in upright position the way it 's made the airflow comes out near the handle it does n't affect the functionality of the machine and as you get to see how the extensions fit together and work it 's simply ingenious ! they 've done an excellent job putting this together also i 'm really glad that dyson made it to the us some other companies here ripped him off and i 'm glad the original cyclonic vaccuum cleaner is on the market here no i do n't work for them i used to live in the uk and know his story it does n't bother me that the vaccuum head will only go flush underneath couches just use the extensions ! the amount of very fine particles and fibres it sucks up is amazing i got at least half a canister full after freshly cleaning with my old vaccuum cleaner my daughter has allergies so this will make a difference i 'm sure the only negative is that the unit falls over fairly easily it 's a very small price to pay and i would thoroughly recommend it
do n't be afraid to purchase reconditioned the first one came and it had little plastic pieces floating around the box i logged on and in two minutes i had told amazon what the problem was and asked for a new one in two days a new one was at my door ! i packaged up the broken one and off it went back shipping paid for and everything the dyson works great though i have to say i have it under glass and we all just sit there and gaze at how pretty it is and that it 's finally home '' ahhhh
when i bought this machine after haveing to by a new vacuum every year for the past 3 years i was afraid it was all just hype amazon shipped it in two days and i was off and running it is easy to use not at all noisy made my rugs look new and picked up everything on my hard wood easy to set up and get moving i would highly highly reccomend my 'reconditioned ' vacuum came like new with no indication that it was not completely new
i have two long haired shedding dogs at home and there is black hair everywhere ! ! i looked everywhere for a vacuum that could suck up all of the hair ! the guy i work with has this dyson at home he loves it and recommended it i figured why not what have i got to loose let me tell you this is the greatest vacuum ever i used to dread running the sweeper stopping times to clean out the hose etc with the dyson i have to stop once to empty the canister but that it is it sucks and cleans like nothing i have ever seen i absolutely love this vacuum and would recommend it to everyone it is just a shame that i can only give it 5 stars
of course it is a vacuum so that is what it is supposed to do i am very pleased with this product and impressed by its performance it really does suck a lot of dirt out of carpet the carpet actually looks refreshed '' after vacuuming my only knock against it is the accessories using the hand held brushes is a little unwieldy in close quarters however my previous vacuum was no star in this area either
this vacuum has exceeded my hopes and all at a great price !
for 300 this vacuum was a no brainer it works far better than all the others we 've had wife is please so i 'm happy just wish we would have purchased this one before the last two junkers SMILE the only issue we have is the hose extention length it would help if it were longer but considering the design and where the hose is located i 'm happy
we just purchased the reconditioned dyson dc 14 and so far it works pretty well 1. the noise level is a solid ok '' 2. the suction is decent 3. it has a rotating spiral brush that automatically brushes the rug when the vacuum is turned on you have the option to turn it off when you have to clean hard wood floors 4. it has no bag filter which is a plus the collected dirt can be easily removed from the container with one press of a button do have the option to clean the stairs with a very flexible attached cleaning hose that can be extended 6. unfortunately the reconditioned version comes only with a 6 month limited warranty 7. it is a bit bulky but that is forgiveable 8. the weight of the vacuum could be lighter 9. the price is reasonable i assume compared to the original retail price of approx 550 overall out of a 5 star rating i would rate the reconditioned towards a 4
completely pan and his recipe mario 's that is was perfect ! i am way over the age of 13
maybe because i did n't purchase this a a pizza pan it has so many more uses the only restriction is to heat it up as you would a cast iron pan slow and steady this pan stays on my range at all times pancakes bacon heat up vegetables a quick chicken breast so many uses and such a great price ! mario has done it again
the batali pan is a lot heavier than expected but the handles make it easy to manage i 've only tried using the pan to bake pizza so far and using my favorite pizza crust recipe the pan proved to be a very worthwhile investment i like that it baked the crust quickly at a lower oven temperature than was required with baking stones it also does an excellent job of drying out the crust to make a nice crunchy feel that 's the way we like our pizza i 'm looking forward to trying it on a few other items pancakes roasted vegetables etc the pan is definitely worth the price
this pan is great from the design point of veiw except that its handle is made so fragile it could break easily if not handled with care when i first received it the packing was poorly done and because of that the handle was broken i observed the handle and noticed that it could break easily if not handled with care but the baking surface is excellent and the look is excellent too so i it and i am hoping that this time i will get it in tact well i finally got the second shipment i still think the packaging is poor for such a fragile item the packaging from the manufacturer is itself not good to top it off amazon 's packing was poor also which is very unusual hopefully this will serve as a constructive criticism for future improvement
i used store bought pizza dough and the pan delivered a nice crispy crust here 's a hint roll out or stretch the dough on parchment paper then transfer the parchment and all directly to the preheated pan no cleaning of the kitchen counter or the pan
wonderful pizza pan i enjoy having the handles to lift the pan in and out of the oven makes very crisp pizza and is easy to clean i love it
the first pan arrived with a broken handle due to being packed poorly after contacting amazon a replacement pan arrived packed much better and in good shape thank you for your quick response
this pan is great read about it in our local newspaper a chef used it in his home kitchen to test and he loved it i do to now i can finally get pizza at home as good as the stuff we used to get in san francisco north beach area
this is a wonderful pizza pan makes great pizza and is easy to clean although it 's a little heavy
i received many compliments on this beautiful tree wish it were a music box too folks keep picking it up to turn it on
i bought these sheets for about 20 egyptian cotton queen size sheets for 20 ! what an awesome deal my sheets were a steal but these are a really great deal for anything under 50 i was prepared for cheap sheets sometime you never know even with the higher tc but they turned out to be awesome the sheets are thick but not heavy and soft and the color is a mellow green i 've had them for 6 months now and i love them
this is a great sheet set nice cotton the only thing i would advise is taking them out of the dryer while they are alittle damp and putting them on the bed they do n't wrinkle as bad that way and do n't have to iron them they are a very nice cotton not lightweight but just right i 've enjoyed them very much would recommend ! !
as subject says soft and comfortable for the price you ca n't beat it fits well
it really cools the wine fast and looks nice great gift to take to a dinner party not good for keeping things cold for long hours so drink fast
i mostly pick projects that require rounds this is perfect as i can mix and match sizes and having to run out and buy new circular needles each time ! ! !
this set is substantial in size they were easy to fill because the plastic plug partially screws unlike others that require a lot of pulling and prying to remove the stoppers the finish is easy to maintain
was looking for a crockpot small enough to cook one meal for two i have used this one for soups and stews and it works perfectly it is a great time saver and the price is right
umm i think this is the same one i have ! when it comes to quart sizes it 's all the same to me haha anyway i love my lil crockpot it 's one of those nifty items that has so many uses you can have it for a long time and still discover something new it can do i 've cooked all kinds of things in this beans are a dream to make now i do n't even soak them anymore just toss them in with some water and they 're good to go i like this because it has a lot of great features the best is the removable inside that makes it so much easier to clean seriously do n't buy one with a innerware ! you 'll spend extra effort bending over it with a wet towel because you ca n't submerge it with this kind you can take it out and even put it in the dishwasher and the work is done for you it 's awesome i think everyone should have one it 's not only for big families either i live alone and use it a lot my advice as to the size get this particular one because it can make enough for one person if that 's your thing but it can also make enough for three or four so go for it
i had one of these for over 10 years and it never gave me a day 's trouble the only reason i purchased a new one was that the old model did not have a removable crock fantastic addition to the small family 's kitchen
i love this smaller crockpot for dips of any kind my family has food at every get together and having this 2 quart crockpot is perfect it makes cleaning up easier too
this is a must for anyone who longs for a sharp knife for many people this type of sharpness is unknown and should be experienced and enjoyed sharpening should be left to kyocera as they can do the best possible job and this knife should only need to be sharpened about every years based upon how often you use it i agree with the chipping liability but this is a small price to pay to have an incredible knife in the kitchen be sure to keep your eyes on what you are slicing
the kyoto ceramic company makes all kinds of stuff out of ceramics from circuit boards and transmitters in mobile phones to excellent writing pens with sturdy ceramic tips they 've got their brand of excellence in everything their entire line of ceramic knives is no different ! being hardened ceramic this knife and its brethren can not be rusted and the blade seems to stay sharper a lot longer because the edge does n't need to be trued like steel it 's to acids and bases and you can easily clean its surface with warm soapy water the weight balance and blade control are excellent and the knife seems to dance as it cuts i am really impressed with the overall quality of the blade itself there is only one caveat but it is a big one the blade will chip if you are not careful ! cutting on surfaces other than cutting boards or pizza stones can cause tiny chips in the edge improper sharpening you should get a sharpener specific for a ceramic knife and use it exactly as instructed and throwing the knife in drawers without a blade cover will also chip the blade edge dishwashing is a since the edge might be damaged as well if you get some chips or nicks the blade will still cut but the edge will slowly become serrated instead of smooth i recommend getting a proper sharpener bamboo cutting board and blade guard for this or any other ceramic knife so that you can make the knife last for generations ! a good buy overall but only if you take care of it
i ordered various cookie cutter sizes and shapes i was pleased with them all they were shipped quickly and packaged carefully
i just started buying fiesta ware and amazon has been the best source i love the combination of persimmon and cinnabar and have acquired quite a bit of these dishes i like all sizes of plates and bowls which are heavy and durable persimmon is my favorite color but second is cinnabar
enjoy the different colors able to mix and match to suit moods or food being served they seem to wear well and be chip resistant the only downside for me is that one of the cinnabar plates came with an etched '' scratch mark on it not sure if it was from manufacturing it is only slightly visible they are standard size '' dinner plates at times wish they were just a little bit bigger otherwise so far quite happy with them and they can always be
i have used the same fiesta ware for the last 12 years and i have not broken a piece yet ! even when my 2 teenage boys were babies and doing dishes a piece may have slipped out of their hands but nothing was ever broken this shows how durable the fiesta ware really is i would highly recommend fiesta ware to everyone of all ages i own piece settings at the present time and plan on expanding i like the fact that you can collect all different colors and it looks great ! i will be ordering more for when my 2 boys go to college i plan on ordering my mother a 20 piece set for her birthday i love it and i know you would toooo
you just ca n't go wrong with fiestaware it 's sturdy durable attractive cleans up easily from table to dishwasher to cabinet and if my family ca n't break it no one can
i work in an assisted living facility and we use fiestaware in the alzheimer 's area these dinner plates are great because you have room for a main dish and two side dishes as well as a dinner roll with being used in an alzheimer 's area these plates are occassionally abused i have seen the accidently dropped and i have seem the purposely pushed off of the table in either case the plate did n't break though they were a little pricey and we even get a deal because we buy in large quantities they are worth it ours seem to last forever they get used for all 3 meals plus snacks and if we need it these plates have double and mini serving platters
i have occasionally noticed restaurants using fiestaware which is an accurate testament to the product 's durability
i always loved the original fiestaware that my grandma was very happy when the new line came purchased my first placesettings at least 8 years ago and they are wonderful ! they take a lot of abuse as we do n't have a dishwasher and not one has broken or cracked my sister had bought pfaltzgraff at the same time and has since replaced them all as they cracked chipped and am still buying additions to my sets now my kids are buying it for themselves great stuff
what 's not to love fun halloween shapes good size for cookies with kids not too big or two small easily recognizable shapes metal so they cut well and they come on a ring so you can keep the organized ! i 'm even adding some of my other cutters to this handy ring
i 've never used a before but it made me an expert after the first time i cooked a delicious one afternoon and it cleaned up very nicely too the removeable crock is very convenient and cooled down relatively quickly after turning it off and removing the food no scrubbing was necessary and that was what i was most impressed with nice clean look and i 'm sure i 'll make use of the two smaller dip '' trays that were included package included a few recipes which is great for a beginner like me
just wanted to say i finished making a delicious beef stew with my new slow cooker it is wonderful came in excellent condition all the temperature settings definitely are very different our stew was cooked on high for 4 hours and now its on keep warm i absolutely love the new appliance its wonderful to be able to throw a meal together in the and evening time its done i do n't have to stand over it and watch it i am making a chili for my dog tomorrow i love it ! i recommend it to everyone
this is a great idea i still use a crockpot cookbook my mother gave me 15 years ago with my old rival crockpot in order to get the meat just right the vegetables and potatoes would overcook with the hamilton beach the meat turns out great and i put the vegetables in the second dish later in the cooking cycle both come out the way the should do n't settle for a one purpose unit when you can get the hamilton beach
these sheets are extremely nice and i am very pleased with them they fit my older mattress well but are made so they would also work for a deeper pocket they do wrinkle some when washed but still remained soft great value for the price and i would definitely buy these again
this sheet set is one of the best the bottom sheet has elastic all the way around for a great fit plus they are soft wash without fading great produc
i bought 3 king sets when these were on sale and my only regret is that i did n't buy more even at regular price these are worth the money they are so smooth and silky soft and i am super picky about sheets i absolutely will not sleep on any sheet that has any pilling or roughness going on my skin is too sensitive the pockets are deep and the sheet stays on the bed they also launder well i do wish there were darker shades though these pastels are nice but i prefer deeper shades that wo n't stop me from buying more though i ca n't see the color when i am blishfully asleep
the sheets were soft right out of the package we bought the sage green king size the color is nice and the pockets are extra deep i have a pillow top and there is more than enough room to keep the sheets in place i highly recommend these sheets and will be purchasing more for myself in the near future
i just love my new sheets and i like getting then at such a low price
really comfortable sheets looks like they could be high quality and long lasting smooth and soft delivery was good value was at 59
if you have a mattress with deep corners not a problem covers the pillow tops with ease and the material is extremely comfortable
these sheets are extremely soft and durable we 've had them for about a week and love them washed three times already and still look as if brand new the hot water does n't affect them at all not sure why this would be but both husband and i have had a better nights sleep sleeping on these sheets they are very comfortable soft and luxurious i would highly recommend and give them as gifts
i have had a brikka for about three weeks now and think is the greatest ! it is easy to use clean and the espresso comes out with crema and is very hot every time ! i have n't had any problems with it at all a few tips in order to unscrew it for cleaning simply run it under cold water for a minute and then pull the valve inside the top chamber up to release the pressure then it will unscrew easily also you will hear a distinct noise when the espresso is almost finished you can look into the top of the coffee maker and see the crema at this point do n't wait too long before you take it off the stove and serve as the creme will disappear if you cook it too long enjoy
i have been drinking my cuban coffee since i was four years old so i have some experience with espresso and the usual moka pot the brikka absolutely makes a fantastic espresso even with a standard brand like bustelo or paloma the crema is delicious i had no problem getting it even in the beginning with the first few sacrificial '' pots the coffee is so smooth i 've also brewed side by side with my other pots and there is a difference it just taste yummy that 's the right word here do n't worry that you ca n't get the 2 cup in the us the 4 cup will do you fine really it 's not that big a deal the 4 cup looks larger than you 'd expect but i think that 's just because it needs extra room to make the steam 4 cups '' of espresso is not even one full cup of american coffee there 's no need to hesitate it and enjoy
i bought mine about a month ago and love it first someone mentioned how difficult it is to take apart after i make the coffee i rinse it with cool water then lift up lightly on the valve after the pressure is dissipated it is very simple to unscrew the top from the bottom i still am not getting crema most of the time and the amount of coffee varies even though i am being very careful about using the right amount of water just up to the line in the plastic measuring cup the last pot i made i packed the coffee slightly and ended up with about 30 more coffee than any other time i 've made it i 've been using lavazza espresso coffee from the supermarket already ground in a can it tastes fine to me i 'm not a nut about the coffee process i just like i 'd like to get more crema to see if it tastes different but i do love the coffee i 'm getting i use it almost every day i did have one minor problem with it the relief valve on the bottom leaked around it i simply tightened it a bit with a wrench and since then it 's fine i definitely noticed a difference in the quality and quantity of the coffee after tightening the valve before i fixed it the coffee was burnt tasting and i got only about of what i now normally get
i have used this espresso maker for two months and find it excellent it takes a little time to get proportions right but eventually it produces a very good cup of coffee i had two the bialetti moka easy electric models and both failed in a relatively short time this model is a much better alternative
i actually bought this for my wife for her birthday but i think i enjoy it more then she does i know that this does n't make true '' espresso but it comes mighty close in my opinion i 'm not much of a connoisseur but i do love a good cup in fact this is better then most any other espressos i 've had ! i love the coffee this thing produces ! the first night i ended up drinking 6 shots of 'espresso ' made with fresh baba budan beans and i still wanted more ! i could n't do it though because it was in the morning and i was wide awake from drinking so much coffee here are a few tips for you make sure you have a burr grinder you want a fine grind but not too fine to get the most out of your coffee burr grinders can be quite the investment but well worth it you will need a burr grinder for any espresso machine anyways make sure you have cups close by this thing will suddenly shoot out coffee and if you 're not quick enough you might get some coffee on your stove as soon as you hear the gurgle and whistle get your cup ready ! you 'll know what i 'm talkin about after a few rounds you 'll have it down chances are your first pot will not turn out perfect unless you 've done something like this before which i have n't the good news is that after your first time you will understand how the process works and everything will be fine after that ! clean this as soon as you can ! it will be hot for awhile but try to clean it asap to make cleaning easier it 's worth it trust me follow the instructions exactly it 's not hard to do by any means but make sure you read the instructions if you accidently do something wrong such as pack in the coffee tightly then you will be sorry the instructions are very simple but very useful i noticed one reviewer mentioned that this coffee comes out tasting burnt if you grind your coffee too fine then it gets caked inside the coffee holder and it takes longer for the coffee to make it up inside the main chamber excuse my lack of correct terminology this does cause a burnt flavor because only a little bit of coffee comes out at a time which causes that little bit to become a bit burnt before the next splash comes through if you grind it slightly more coarse then this will not happen and your coffee will taste amazing i have a feeling that the people that mention the burnt flavor are grinding their coffee a bit too fine you want the coffee to be ground fine but not like flour more like fine sugar have fun ! this simple little gadget makes a fine cup enjoy
first i 'd like to thank my friend tony from italia for introducing me to this little gadget on our campout last month secondly i 'd like to thank daigo for his excellent write up and brikka blog if you are a coffee addict especially to espresso macchiato or cordato and are a cheapskate like myself then you 've found yourself the right product while technically mokka is n't espresso it 's pretty darn close and only an espresso aficionado will know the difference this product does a great job of making that intense robust elixir to sharpen the senses i 've had it for about a month now and find myself daily back on any street in italy or spain mornings start out with a couple espresso with foamed milk and then comes the afternoon espresso bump it 's great ! if you do n't want to drop the 500 for the official machine then this little guy will do the job a note concerning the cr me and 4 cup controversy to be honest my 4 cup maker cranks out the cr me you have to play with the grind the way it 's packed and even the volume of water you add folks say the 4 cup wo n't do it but down here in texas it does it 's job lot 's of cr me in the pot and on my lips ! SMILE so maybe it 's the water or technique i do n't know but rather than going through the cost and hassle of getting an italian 2 cup version i recommend you get this criticisms well i gave this 4 stars because it is a bit tedious to get your coffee going and more of a pain to clean my biggest gripe is unscrewing the bottom tank from the top it 's a real bear even when completely cool all in all it 's a great product worth the money i 'd buy it again given the chance if you love espresso and do n't want to buy the ferrari then get this you wo n't be disappointed
i agree with daigo and others that the brikka i only have the model makes a really nice caf that while technically not espresso is very very tasty and the model does produce crema as for david 's results it 's puzzling if the coffee is boiling in the upper chamber i 'd guess not enough pressure is building i would speculate that the seal between the chambers is not complete check to see if there are any grounds breaking the seal before you screw them together if there is nothing blocking a perfect seal i 'd suspect a defect even if the model is superior to the i ca n't imagine a functioning to produce the results you 're getting
full review with pictures and video http wonder how brikka makes crema actually it 's a simple and neat trick at the nodule of the upper chamber from where the coffee comes out brikka has a metallic valve on the nodule that keeps the coffee from coming out until the pressure of the coffee from the bottom chamber becomes string enough to push up the valve once the valve opens the coffee comes out with a strong pressure going through the narrow exit of the nodule this makes the similar effect of the espresso machine and thus foams the crema how does it taste it 's by far superior than moka pot or cheap espresso machine when you carefully follow the instruction that comes with brikka the crema is very smooth and the coffee has the characteristic of espresso the instruction includes the careful measurement of water strength of the stove flame and shaking down the new brikka for the first use the crema is such a delicate matter and you also have to be careful when you pour the coffee into the cup all these things may sound too much work but actually it 's not bad at all after you get use to it washing brikka may be more pain than the all in one espresso maker but i can not complain when given this good production of coffee and brewing a good coffee in a traditional way is always fun the pot is made with aluminum i saw some reviews that complained that it is not made from stainless steel but i also heard most of the italian makers say aluminum pots make better coffee and i believe it is because of its high conductivity this review is based on
the coffee i made with the brikka tastes so much better than any i 've made before and i have an espresso machine which i no longer use the directions do say to leave the lid open while you are brewing so the part is unnecessary really
i thought this was a nice pan but i do n't think it was quite worth the 16 plus shipping i thought it would be heavier for that price it 's still a good pan and i found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts they usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet but i just used the pan instead with fine results i do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal cake donuts but still they are good just do n't over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking nothing stuck not even to the center flutes i will definitely use it again and try many different recipes the donuts are not too big or too small fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better
i 'm a proud celiac chick from finland but i 'm also a lover of homemade donuts now for those of you who do n't know what celiacs are we ca n't eat any wheat or gluten in no i 'm not implying you 're stupid we ca n't eat flour it runs along the lines of an allergy although the experts will gladly look down their noses and tell you it is not so how the heck do i eat donuts when they 're made completely of flour the answer is my cooking angel bette hagman who wrote up a donut recipe in one of her books more from the gluten free gourmet anyway i use that recipe however i do n't use this donut mold like i 'm supposed to no i do n't do baked 's a donut if you do n't do the indulgent thing i put the batter into three of the molds at a time tip it into the oil and i deep fat fry those little suckers and god are they good ! so my ultimate point here is that this donut mold is extremely useful in more ways than one so grab one especially if you 're a celiac and put your imagination and cooking skills to work
this is what i was looking for to cover my other burners while i cook but the depth of the covers do not reach down to the stoves surface you can tell that they do n't fit the burners but it is covering them and i will deal with that for the price that they cost
these are very attractive to look at although the discription is a little wrong it says green flower pots on white background but the background is actually cream i have a white stove therefore the covers clash a little but they are pretty and fit nicely i would have given it a 5 stars if the color would have been correct
what can i say it lives up to its hype it covers 1 stick of butter and fits into my decor
this is the best covered butter dish i have ever owned it is very durable dishwasher and microwave safe and has a handle on the lid which most do not
excellent product i especially like the roominess of the cover no more butter crawling up the sides ! yea
it came quickly 6 days with amazon 's free shipping it came today and within 10 mins all my knifes were very sharp i then gave my new oxo 6.5 knife i ordered this with the hone a few passes over my sharping stone then 10 light passes on the hone wow '' i can shave with this now i like the on all of my oxo products very pleased well worth the price 14.95
this is the usual high quality of oxo however it 's a bit smaller then i expected the directions told me to put the tip on the counter and sharpen down and toward you a different method the i had been using but it works quite nicely
very good kitchen tool as always with kitchenaid enough said
this is the best media storage cabinet i have owned in over 25 years of storing media it 's outside design is great the shelving design inside is flexible so you may use it to hold cds dvds videos including those sized special edition sets '' if you like it 's durable i 've bought six of these and placed two in 3 of the rooms in my house each of which have different availability and i 've found that these are the right overall size for all of my conditions
beautiful and solid this cd storage unit arrived quickly and in perfect condition its simple clean lines perfectly match our aesthetics now that our cd 's are organized we listen to them more since it 's easier to find what we 've got our only challenge is to find exactly where to put it since you need ample room on either side to open the deep doors with the cd 's in them
this cabinet is pretty very well made and great for cd storage it came in a timely manner and was very well packaged i would buy another one if i needed it in a heartbeat
this is an excellent item for media storage which delivered all that it promised and then some it is very well made the wood of superior quality not pressed board and the shelves are perfectly made it does store cds dvds and vhs media depending on how you arrange the shelving the shelves fit in on little pegs which can be arranged in whatever hight your media requires in fact the assembly was far more simple than i had imagined only the shelves needed to be put in place i was so happy with it i bought two more
the first order for this arrived damaged and had to be sent back and replaced the second shipment arrived in better shape and is exactly what i was searching for however it had a broken shelf which was replaced i am a very satisfied customer as the cabinet was exactly what i wanted however i was disatisifed with the packaging and shippment process due to the damage although i must admit the company was very responsive to my return and replacement needs
this is a very sturdy beautiful piece of furniture it holds an incredible amount of cds and looks wonderful in our room the storage cabinet was packed very well and looks beautiful
i was so pleased with the description of this product that i ordered two today i have placed my order for the third the finish is beautiful and the cabinets very well built the design is handsome a welcome addition to our livingroom one of the units was dammaged in shipping and the company replaced the part fairly quickly we have a large collection of dvds and tapes with numerous attemps over thiry years at storing them this is by far the best solution we have found
i have had this grinder for just a few days but have to say overall i love it in particular i like how easy it is to set the coarsness of the grind an the volume and just hit a button and walk away there is one item that is clear in the instruction booklet however the bean hopper holder for the beans can be removed and placed in the dishwasher for cleaning i could n't for the figure out how to get it off well you simply turn the until it unscrews this is not intuitive because turning the holder left or right also changes the coarseness setting caution empty the beans out of it first or they 'll wind up all over your counter ! i should n't be permitted to do anything mechanical before having my morning coffe ! also depending on the of the grind you select it will produce a slightly higher or lower volume of cofee for instance i found that the medium coarsness setting set on 8 cups actually produced enough coffee for 9 or 10. i found that the slightly finer grind 2 clicks of the which worked better for a metal filter produced exactly the right amount for 8 cups after your first batch you 'll get the hang of it what 's nice about this is once you know what amount and to set you can just dump the coffee into your coffee maker rather than having tomeasure it out a spoon at a time the grinder comes with a 90 day warrantee a longer warrantee for a new one
i purchased the very same model from amazon and it did n't work ! amazon sent me another right away and it has been great for a few months i must admit that i do not make espresso at home and i no longer use the old perculator so i can not speak to the fine and coarse settings i use it daily it is really loud but that 's not a problem for me
i have resisted a burr grinder for years too big too complicated too hard to clean got a french press recently and was advised by starbucks barrista to get a burr grinder for the best coffee experience well i got the reconditioned cuisinart supreme and am absolutely thrilled ! it 's not too big and clumsy and is very easy to clean the ease of storing the beans in the unit and just hitting start for an accurate measure and grind is incredible have only tried the medium grind in my drip pot so far and the flavor is definitely superior to the blade ground coffee i should also mention that i use an amazon visa card that earns amazon points 25 at a time so this grinder only cost 9.99 and the shipping was free my usual experience with amazon is that they under promise and over deliver got a great product at a very good price that was delivered almost a week earlier than i expected
this grinder is good enough for a french press fa real fa real love the hopper have n't tried to clean it yet but looks simple enough feels solid good engineering
well can all my plaudits three weeks of moderate use and it 's already broken bah
i purchased a better coffee grinder at a lower price than i could find at a local store and i received it promptly as well
this works much better than the blade type grinder i think you get a much better flavor from your coffee and it seems milder also i would highly recommend this mill
this unit is awesome best looking and best working for the money i could n't ask for a better working item for the money put the beans in and set and you get the ground coffee in seconds
this grinder may be noisier than some others but it stays clean and grinds a perfect grind each and every time excellent
since i no longer have a gas stove i purchased the rival electric wok the temperature is consistent the bowl of the wok is large so plenty of veggies etc can be stir 'm very pleased with my purchase of the rival wok
we got this for our apartment and have been very happy no cord is nice and with the charge station it 's always ready to go in our small it 's not a pain to empty the small compartment a couple times each time we vacuum the place the trash can is close only problem is that every 5 vacuums or so the rotating brush gets snagged where hair wraps around it otherwise good power and small size is fun and eas
i 've had this little vac for about a month now and i use it all the time and just love love love it it 's great for the rv and it 's just what i needed for my entry room and kitchen using it in these rooms which only takes a couple of minutes every day keeps the mess out of the rest of the house and soooo easy ! ! ! now i do n't have to drag that big vac around the house so often the dirt devil is easy to use and it 's easy to clean it 's light weight and does a great job on my floors and flat carpeting and it holds a charge for as long as i 've needed it so far maybe 15 or 20 minutes at a time this is the best purchase i 've made in a long time and i highly recommend this little work horse
this vacuum does a pretty good job it is lightweight and easy to use it stays charged for quite a long time the purpose is not intended for general housecleaning but for convenience and quick use it is great
the dirt devil 083414 extreme power stick cordless vacuum really performs ! i did 1200 square feet and it was still going strong bigger collection cup than others and this dirt devil goes easily from the bare floor to the area rugs or carpet without a hitch i have a lot of tile with area rugs and some carpet every other vacuum i have had sucked up the area rugs and had to be lifted onto them and avoid the edges this vacuum just rolls right on and cleans them corner to corner ! i leave the brush on all the time since we have 2 large hairy dogs the hair does not build up in the brush because suction is strong enough to pull it thru small footprint stores on charging base lightweight and easy to assemble and use it has dual filters so there is absolutely no emission smell and the outside filter that protects the inside filter is very easy to clean then all snaps right back in place the best stick vacuum out there
this dirt devil has been a life saver for me it picks up lint dog hair crumbs from every meal my 2 boys eat and pretty much every other small thing on the floor it has good suction and does an ok job on carpet too it wo n't pull up the dirt embedded in the carpet but picks up the noticeable stuff the only thing i would change is that the size of the floor piece is pretty small which helps it store easily but it takes a little longer to vacuum each area overall well worth the money spent
i purchased this vaccuum just to use on the hard floor surfaces in my home and it is great for picking up food crumbs and hair off the floor i love it !
what more can i say i was very pleased and surprised with how quickly they arrived
great transaction fast shipping geniune miele bags will purchase from this seller again
okay so it 's hard to get excited about things like hepa filters or the vacuum cleaners and other devices they are used in when my wife concluded her extensive search for a replacement to our old canister vacuum and anointed miele the winner i was slightly less enthusiastic than she it 's a vacuum cleaner it 's just a tool for keeping things trim after a very short while i began to understand her admiration for the design and build quality of this particular tool the hepa filters and bags used are no less a part of this than is the vacuum itself if you tire of vacuums that are constantly gritty with the dust they but do n't quite capture get a miele if you distain the smell emanating from your vacuum 's exhaust get a miele if you long for a simple easy to use and maintain system that even your husband will use get a miele use genuine miele bags and change your hepa filter as recommended the difference in cost is minor but you will be amazed at the difference in results
i had been using my victorinox steak knives for all my cutting needs because i ca n't be bothered to get out my huge cooking knives and have to clean them afterward yes i am that lazy i finally decided to get some knives for paring etc that i can throw in the dishwasher the first time i used the paring knife in this set i actually cut my thumb because they are so much sharper than what i had been using yes i have that horrible habit of cutting towards my thumb and not away anyway i was pretty impressed this is a good brand and this is a nice little set
i have had my set of swiss army '' paring knives in red for something like 15 years i have always called them my ultimate paring knives '' the serrated knife is by far my favorite for slicing up fruit and other small tasks it 's amazing they are still very sharp and cut perfectly after so long i just discovered them here on amazon i have n't seen them for sale for a long time you ca n't really go wrong with these knives
i adopted a 6 year old male coon hound he was already set in his ways being an older dog i started working with him with the training collar on i rarely had to even use the shocking button the collar made training very easy he can be able to be free and run but also know that i am still the master and follow my commands just by using the tone button on the remote i stared training him with a much shorter range collar and it did not give him the freedom that i wanted while training the collar is very durable and works very effectivly for me and my dog i recommend this training collar to anyone who is serious about training
works like it should no problems good pricing would like to have a regular size battery in the handheld but almost all of them use the same odd
i really like these wipes for all of my stainless steel appliances they clean and shine everything really well i just use a soft cloth to dry the appliances after wiping them down i also use the spray made by the same company along with the wipe i have several appliances and 1 wipe dries out before i am finished no streaks doing it this way
this stool is very versitle it is a step ladder it 's a stool and it 's a fashion decorator accessory for kitchen
i have wanted one of these for years i put off because i did n't want to put it together i 'm a 75 year old alone i kept looking for one locally guess what ! ! ! it 's already assembled comes as you see it thanks so much
i bought this stool for my daughter to use in her grade classroom it serves as both a step stool for retrieving needed materials on top shelves in the classroom and a place to once in a while sit in front of the students she loves it ! lori thinks it 's the coolest and it is ! addition to a classroom and the bright red color makes it a happy fixture in the room so while this is very servicable item it also looks retro cool to the students sharon perkins cordele g
my grandmother had one of these in her kitchen and it was always my favorite place to climb up and sit at her breakfast counter i loved it and am so glad to see it back in style after possibly hundreds of children and adults using it to sit stand and climb and after years it is still working and in fine condition if these new ones are as good quality definitely a great buy ! very sylish too !
my husband bought me these for christmas and i love them the cups are feel like a restaurant cups and the tree is very decorative i love the way they look and feel we use them every single morning for our coffee
although i 'm not using the cups that came with the set the mug tree looks very nice against my color scheme it is sturdy and easy to clean
i 'm very happy with the quality of this set one small problem that i 'm sure bodum will stand behind is a hairline crack at the bottom of one of the handles highly recommended
this was the perfect size and shape for my morning cup of coffee the stand makes it convenient to have them next to my coffee maker i am very satisfied with the purchase

i do n't always like purchasing reconditioned things but got in on a great deal during a sale and so could n't pass it up as it ended up only like 30 more than a spare 6 qt bowl for my other kitchenaid ! so i got it as a second mixer and love it yeah its a little loud but that 's fine i think its supposed to sound that way i prefer coated beaters because i 'm lazy and like a dishwasher safe attachment but i can order one if i really want it but the main thing is this is just like brand new and you ca n't beat the price
love it ! love it ! love it ! what more can i say works great like new
i bought this mixer knowing that i was taking a chance on the quality and this time it paid off i bake occasionally and this has satisfied my needs completely i have n't tried any yet but may in the future the only reason this did n't get 5 stars is because it is a bit noisy around the or speed it sounds a little rough but at higher speeds it runs like a champ despite the noise i think this was a great purchase
i have been using this reconditioned kitchen aid for 100 days i think that is the good thing with a strong power it srand up very well so i would like to recommend you to keep one in your kitchen furthermore the price was very exciting i got it about free shipping
this is a great mixer its a little loud but worth it for the power you get
i 'm delighted with my refurbished kitchenaid mixer it 's a delight to use and the first stand mixer i 've owned i 'll never buy a brand new kitchenaid again
why did n't i buy a kitchenaid 20 years ago last night i made meatloaf it took exactly 5 minutes to prepare it i used it to mix lefse norwegian for christmas i use it for cookies this is the bare bones version but if you wait for a 40 off coupon at linens things or bed bath and beyond you can get accessories at a reasonable price great
although i have only used the mixer a total of 7 times since my purchase i am pleased with its performance a friend who visited at thanksgiving said hers is much quieter and that mine sounds like it has a loose bearing oh well all i know is that it works for me i am pleased with my purchase
i love these screens because they do so much more than pizza yup i 'm a gadget junkie and these fit the requirements use them for a splatter screen '' when pan frying roast nuts make croutons or bruchetta and of course pizza crust is done from underside like it should be
i 'm writing this review mostly because of oldamazonian 's complaint that the foam pad is made by leggett and platt i do n't own this particular size serta pad although i have recently purchased a 1.5 inch version in the 3 pound weight and it too came in a rather generic and unmarked bag however all or almost all of serta 's foam products are made by leggett and platt ! ! ! and leggett and platt supplies serta with much of the materials that go into their mattresses too so in essence a serta foam pad is a leggett and platt foam pad ! serta does n't make foam themselves they simply market the foam products that leggett and platt makes so no the pad probably wo n't come in pretty serta packaging but it 's made by the same company that any serta foam product is probably made by my guess is that serta is doing marketing '' in selling it for leggett and platt as a serta product here
overall my girlfriend and i are both happy with this topper we 'll be combining furniture and households in the near future retaining her bed so i needed a temporary solution to my aging mattress before that happens thankfully this topper has provided it and my girlfriend who hated my old mattress has slept more soundly and comfortably since the first night the first few nights i found it very uncomfortable and woke with pain in my lower back and hips but after about three nights my body adjusted i found that i much prefer sleeping with the topper than without i 've spent some time on beds and the topper feels close to but not quite i feel that when the topper is placed in its protective slipcover and then my bedsheet is place over that the of it is diminished and it doesnt feel dramatically different from the old style of foam toppers that have been around for years as far as some other concerns go i did not find the rubber smell to be overpowering but it was noticeable for the first night or two now the smell is also i live in florida and i was concerned about the topper holding and radiating too much heat thankfully this is not the case and the topper provides a comfortable sleeping temperature finally i had to cut 7 inches off the width of it to get the queen sized topper to fit on my full sized bed a full sized topper would have been too narrow and considerably too short it may cost a little more but i recommend going a size larger and cutting down to what you need cutting the topper was very easy with a yardstick and an ordinary pair of sharp scissors and i 've seen no crumbling or fraying from where i cut bottom line do i feel like i 'm sleeping on a brand mattress no not really but i am enjoying a more comfortable sleep and i do n't regret the purchase at all oh and the look on your cats faces when they jump on it the first time is worth the price alone ! SMILE
i have collected all of le creuset 's fruit and vegetable shaped cast iron enameled casseroles they are beautiful to display on a table or on a kitchen counter and very practical in cooking great casseroles the color that they can add to a kitchen brightens every vist there the exterior and interior enamel coating is very durable and easy to clean i have cooked a multitude of dishes in these casseroles and have found them to be excellent in heat conduction and preventing hot spots '' the comments of guests served from these casseroles is always positive and never fails to bring a smile to my face there is a drawback to these whimsical cookers and that is the rim of both the top and bottom of the casseroles there is no enamel on these rims and they can rust if not dried immediately after hand washing they are dishwasher safe but i do recommend that you hand wash and dry immediately i also recommend that you let them sit out for an hour or so to air dry before storing them when wet this casserole can be very slippery and the handles on the bottom and top help in preventing dropping them finally closely inspect your casserole when it arrives my first garlic casserole had a two inch crack in the enamel immediately sent a replacement to me and had the defective item picked up at my home at no charge i commend them for standing behind the products they sell
your charges on shipping make it stupid to order from yo
in an attempt to get red coffee mugs i ordered two cinnibar '' fiestaware coffee mugs while they are in the red family the color has too much brown in it for me i wish fiestaware would produce a true red shade other than that they were fine price reduction did n't mean much once the s h were added could have driven to the store paid regular price and still gotten them for less my fault for being lazy
if you 've bought fiestaware place settings in the past you 've surely noticed the awkward shape of the coffee mugs of yore the old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably while the art deco design is lovely using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting morning coffee '' experience we 've come to expect from diner mugs anyway fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle and it 's a realistic size too not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee yay for the java mug
i would like to know where are these pots and pans made i have one revere pan that was made in china and it does not set flat on my stove before i place an order i want to be sure that i am receiving the best product
i 've had my revere pots and pans for years and they 've been great they 're stainless steel with copper bottoms so they heat up more evenly than aluminum everything looks good and fits together right i even have a 10 quart revere pot that i use for boiling lasagna noodles ! what more can you ask
i bought this cookware for my mom and it is working out well for her
i 've had my revere 1400 set for about a month now it takes a bit of time to get used to cooking at the lower temps it cooks well evenly easy to clean even if you burn something could n't be happier
i have been so impressed with this set it all cooks great i think the frying pan would cook best with a gas stove i love the mixing bowls that came with the set it is a very good buy
all the bad reviews on the revere pots and pans are totally off base the newer revere pots and pans are not excactly like the ones made 40 years ago in clinton illinois but this cookware is wonderful i love the light weight it making cooking easier also the taste of the food using these pot and pans is worth the puchase i am so impressed with my set that i bought on amazon and the amazon price was great i 've used froo froo pots and pans heavy in weight and they did not cook my food as well as the revere !
this is a great set you get a lot of cookware for a decent price revere ware lasts this was to add on to a set my mother bought me when i moved into my first apartment 10 years ago the only diffence between my original set and the new one my origianl set was made in ohio now they manufacture in asia the metal is a little thiner and lighter but all in all i am happy with the purchase and would recommend this set to any person looking for a quality cookware set that is n't
before revereware came in sets you could only buy it open stock in better department stores when i was 19 my dad bought 5 sauce pans 2 fry pans and a dutch oven with lids for each he said at the time here you go these will last the rest of your life '' that was forty years ago in that time i have packed my revereware back and forth across the country three times cooked with them on gas and electric ranges on camp stoves and over camp fires the cookware is still good no hot spots no warping and the copper still shines it is going to outlast me i have added to the original cookware my dad bought over the years but i have to buy used revereware to get the heavier pots with the thicker copper bottom to get these i go by the trademark on the bottom of the pans mine has 1801 with paul revere in profile a newer lighter cheaper version has a patent number and something about process
the dirt devil vision self propelled is the best vacuum in the world for carpets not bare floors it does a loisy job on bare floors it is better then any dyson or any hoover or the expensive kirbyvacc you ask why why indeed first of all you probably gotsucked or suckered into believing that suction is the most important thing in a vacuum right no im afraid not its all in the beater bar brush the faster it goes the better it will clean your carpets all the so called suction does is remove what the beater bar brush pulls out yes the better the suction the faster it gets rid of what the brush pulls up mr dyson seems to think that suction is all that matters its not dyson vacuums are poor on rugs becausethefloatingheadon them doesnt get down far enough to get the really deep down dirt like the dirtdevil vision self propelled an important thing is having a solid line of brush on the beater others like dyson or hoover well theyvegot gaps in there brushes why who knows maybe they think there is better air movement or rates that the hoover windtunnel self propelled is the best vacuuminthere i have that model too and yes it does do a good job but it doesntdeep clean like the dirt devil the drive belts also burn outreally quick so its hard to push and pull the cons of the dirt devil vision are its noisy yes its bad on bare floors yes you have to clean the filter ihappento clean mine with another vaccum or i use my air compressor to blow it off i have a very big house and have tested vacuums for years i have a dyson animal a hoover windtunnel and a the way the selfpropelled motor doesntuse a belt like hoovers windtunnel i tell you folks for carpets its the it for the hoover for and the dyson for and the kirby for a you will find that nothing pulls out more then that machine nothing for the money u can buy a dirtdevil vision at your local walmart for 98.00 pretty cheep the design is one of the best easy to empty dirt container the self propelled feature is much better then the hoovers windtunnel why these other reviewers say the belts burn out fast is beyond me i vacuum every day or everyother day because i have pets and my wife has got allergies just to let you know the dyson is a good machine but dosnt have the power a dirt devil has you turn that dirt devil on and you can feel the floor just vibrate and you can hear that beater bar just going like crazy on the floor if you buy one youll be in a shock as to what youll pull out of your carpets and people this vac like most other bagless vacs have filters of some sort they do have to be cleaned now and then the dirt devils suction is very good and it doesnt lose suction very fast the only way it ever would is if you never clean the damn thing thats the price people that you pay for bagless vacs clean the filter once a week or every two weeks depending on how much you use it again i use mine almost everyday and i clean the filter once a week if you never clean the filter you know it probably would do a poor job after seeing the other reviews im very interested in finding out how theres seem to be falling apart or not running very well ive owned mine for and never had any problems yes ive changed the belt on it and have bought a new filter for it now and then but im wondering why these other people are having such difficulty folks the vac is like anything if you take care of it it will last i mean the things got one belt and one filter how hard is that i suppose if you beat the hell out of it i suppose it could brake dum da dum dum dumm
besides looking nice when hung from a pot rack this big pot heats up quickly cooks food effectively allows for metal utensils to be used and is simple to clean i especially like the long handle on one end and the short handle on the other makes maneuvering easy it is a bit pricey but i think it 's worth it
tricky trying to find the perfect window treatment from a pic online but i can not emphasize more strongly how delighted i was to receive this item in a smaller size from this fantastic seller not only did it arrive promptly but it was absolutely perfectly consistent with the description online and the terrific photo as well if you want to soften a window and the room as well for a great price go for it you will not be disappointed from my experience thanks ever to this seller we love a bargain and getting exactly what we pay for
good sturdy pan handle stays cool to the touch easy to clean nice even cooking not too heavy lid seals well i have the 5 quart too and recommend that one as well if i 'm cooking one or the other of them is sure to be in use
if you want to spend this much money for a slicer go ahead and buy this machine ! i use it for almost two years now it 's not so hard to clean as described by a previous simply sponge each side of the blade with a solution after each use and i had the blade removed only a couple of times if you go out to eat you have a much better chance to catch foodpoisoning certainly not from this machine
we 've been using it now for about four months with out a problem it works well on breads meats and cheese contrary to the previous comment the unit is easy to clean and in my opinion some people wash there hands 50 times a day too ! i would recommend this unit to all who wish a rugged and dependable product
i 'm very pleased with this slicer shaves ham and slices bread cheddar cheese does n't slow the motor down in the least nicely designed easy to clean it takes less than 10 minutes to disassemble wash and it fits on the kitchen counter and is good looking highly recommended
this is the lexus of the bottle opener world ! very heavy duty lovely stainless steel business end and pretty shiny handle in the color of your choice ! what more could you want this is a substantial piece of wo n't get lost in the crowded utensil drawer this is not a item ! so do n't get it if you are short on utensil space ! this opener has considerable heft and grabs hold of bottle tops easily if you want your bottle top popped this would be the one to go with
this is a great bottle opener sturdy and only 3.96 everyday at walmart it 'd do you good to pick it up there rather than spend nearly 10 here
i think you could do just about anything to this bottle opener and it would come out just fine as noted by other reviewers this opener has a wonderful substantial weight it has kitchenaid 's signature quality and great color ! goes well with my other utencils and gadgets oh it opens bottles very well too
yes yet another fan of this bottle opener i bought a blue one and a red one i 'll never go back to the kind again ! works like a charm and feels great in your hand i 'm very pleased
this is a great bottle opener because it is deceivingly heavy and sturdy and i actually prefer off beer bottles now simply so i can use my trusty bottle opener i plan on buying more to give as gifts because it makes a perfect accessory to a gift
i love this bottle opener and would buy another if needed without question it is very heavy compared to other openers which makes it all the more durable i love kitchenaid products
oh yeah ! i love this can opener it 's the greatest i tie two of them together with a piece of rope to make nunchucks out of them ! ha yaa
this is probably the sturdiest bottle opener i 've ever used it opens pretty much any bottle with ease and leverage is easy due to its bulk and size you probably wo n't ever lose it either since it 's so big it 's definitely not for travel because of its weight so you 'll want something else if you plan to bring a bottle opener to picnics or camping trips
do n't get all excited it is just a bottle opener you get what you pay for this one is high quality and more expensive if you are a kitchenaid nut this one is great for you if not it is an expensive bottle opener
i was looking for a long time for a mixer that seemed like a good quality i did buy one from the store but it was not high enough quality to suit my online reviews were a big help so i thought i would share mine i bought one pistachio hoping it was not to ugly not knowing what the picture looked like i sent 2 pics but they still are not quite right it was perfect for me more like an old time mint received it only 6 days after i ordered is heavy and seems well put am very picky about quality which seems hard to ran it through a test of 8 cups whole wheat for only small problem i had is the bowl seemed to taking it out i noticed there is a clip on back where the bowl had to pushed into a little to fit made the dough and kneaded it with little am impressed with the like the bowl lift is a little loud but no more than i would expect for a powerful only thing i do n't know at this point is i will last or impression is that it overall quality seems would say it is well worth the money if want something with enough power to get the job done
this product meets any expectations i had for a stand mixer previously i was using a hand mixer for nearly all needs and have found the kitchenaid to make the task so much easier hands free operation is wonderful clean up is easy and it has enough power to mix a large batch of cookie dough !
this is a great do n't know how i lived without it baking is much more fun now
this new one replaced one i had a long time you just ca n't beat ! they 're workhorses and the one i bought is the ! ! luvvit luvvit ! ! buyit buyit ! !
i grew up having a kitchenaid in my home so i knew i always wanted one every sunday we made several batches of cookies we were kids so we were pretty hard on it my mom still has hers and the only thing that needs replacing is the beater that has been well used so no wonder it 's a little shabby looking i was willing to just get the white 4 quart but once my husband got in on the decision we had to have the lift handle it 's nice that i do n't have to pull the mixer out to be able to lift the top of the mixer most people i know say this is n't a big inconvenience my husband did n't like the look of the white and worried it would look dirty we got the imperial gray and i really like it it 's nice having the 6 quart bowl even though it seems a little excessive most of the time except for when we need a ton of cookies at once you know a real emergency it mixes everything so evenly and i like not having to worry about my cookies turning out my sister got one recently and still does n't use it much because she is n't used to having it i find lots of little ways to use it to make cooking and baking easier my son says it looks like a robot and he is sure it 's a boy he has three sisters and no brothers the kids ask me every night if i made the dinner in the kitchenaid and if i say yes they go on and on about how good the dinner is it only took 10 years of marriage to convince my husband it would be a good investment he is sold he loves it too i almost have him convinced to start baking i wish i had gotten it ten years ago i would n't let small children use it unattended as teenagers we thoughtlessly broke several wooden spoons in the mixer because we thought we could get around the beater that always made my mom so mad hehe i look forward to buying the attachments i just bought a wheat grinder last year and i am thinking of selling it and getting the wheat grinder attachment instead if you buy it and use it you will love it but like any other handy appliance it 's a waste of money if you just let it sit there if you like to bake it 's a must have
this has been the perfect purchase for my baking and cake decorating needs i ca n't believe what a great job it does in mixing my decorators frosting clean up is so easy
i have wanted this kitchenaid for years now it was just a bit out of my price range but through amazon i was able to afford it and the service was fast we did have to return our first mixer it was damaged in shipping but amazon quickly sent us out a new one now i have the best mixer on the planet ! i love this machine my sister has had her mixer for over 5 years without a problem and let me tell you we cook alot ! this is well worth the money ! kitchenaid is top of the line in product and customer service
i bought the kitchenaid for my husband who has been whining for one for 5 years he loves it amazon shipped it fast we havent had a problem with it and he uses it for everything i highly recommend it
firstly got ta love 's surfaces which are really durable and easy to clean the colours on this range are really vibrant and can liven up your otherwise bland kitchen space the combination of these 2 pans really make it a pleasure to cook up a storm
my husband and i are wine lovers and have accumulated several types of corkscrews over the years but were never quite satisfied with any of them this corkscrew is really easy and effective it holds up to any corkscrew that we have had for a fraction of the price and no complication
this corkscrew is easy to use and will avoid breaking the cork thanks to it 's two stages you can find the same model here at amazon far cheaper via target
the double step levered corkscrew is a great improvement over a single step pull i first saw this in spain where the pulltap is made and knew i had to have one strongly recommend this item they come in at least two sizes slightly longer handle most descriptions are n't very good
this works great and priced regularly at 7.99 at beverages and more was on sale for 5.99 the easiest corkscrew i ever used was the pocket screwpull which does n't seem to be produced anymore just the table model
i am not a waiter that serves wine an overseas traveler or a wine expert i am just a joe schmo that was looking for a corkscrew i read the reviews on amazon and noticed this item had an average customer rating of 5 stars boy were these customers on the money i bought this rascal and am absolutely amazed that such a simply constructed tool can be so efficient it works great all the other fancy schmancy corkscrews may be cool to look at or lend some to the owner whatever blows your skirt this baby is all anyone needs to open a bottle of wine and enjoy it although i enjoy and trust shopping on amazon readers should note that this item is available at some stores for 10
i have prettier bigger and more expenseive wine openers but none of them match this pulltap for being easy to use the two stage design for removing the cork is genius i 've never broken a cork or struggled to break loose a particularly tough cork when using this pulltap i hate to part with some of my fancy and expensive corkscrews but the truth is that when i want to open wine easily and quickly this is the tool i go to every time i give this one my highest recommentation
we were just at the wine festival in the okanagan valley in british columbia and almost all of the wineries had this type of corkscrew available for sale for 10.00 canadian or less now i 'm wishing we had bought one up there ! the blade was a sharp little regular knife blade though not a serrated blade as shown they were very nice well made and heavy for the size
as a server in an italian restaurant i have to open a plethora of wine bottles in front of customers based on experience with many different corkscrews this is by far the easiest to use it is one of the fastest and smoothest of any corkscrew i have experienced i have however seen it other places for much cheaper than here
i dont honestly know where i first found mine but i fell in love with it immediately you never have to struggle with the cork my parents recently discovered a love for wine and as a gift i was going to get them one of these well to my suprise there is not a single shop in a 100 mile radius that carries this everyone still uses the one step approach or worse yet the auger approach five stars all the way
this is the best easiest waiter 's corkscrew i 've ever used my only qualm is that i 've seen it offered for much cheaper than 19.99
after having purchased several other oxo products naturally when i saw this i had to have it performs well and stylish a loyal oxo fan
i had this white plastic portable paper towel holder i loved and i had it for about 20 years i 'd never seen another one like it it was perfect for my apartment it fit nicely on top of my refrigerator and in my small kitchen there really is n't any place for an mounted paper towel holder then one day i knocked the thing off the top of the fridge and a piece broke off this stainless and black plastic oxo goodgrips grip and rip is close to the one i broke and better actually the brushed stainless body of it looks great it has enough weight to stay put the rubber ring on its bottom grips the countertop and leaves no marks of any kind the bottom of the unit has a slightly raised rim to keep the towels from unwinding on their own and unlike another unit i considered the base is n't larger than it needs to be yet it will hold the roll of towels as well as the smaller standard size what i really like about it is the fact that the whole unit rotates on a bearing when you pull towels off you can put your hand flat on top of the knob to steady it and the stainless top of the knob allows the unit to rotate underneath it when you 've unrolled just the number of towels you want to tear off you only need to grip the clingy rubber underside of the knob with your hand and the unit wo n't turn so you can tear off the towels to refill just press the black button top center on the knob and it comes off so you can remove the empty carboard tube and slip on a new roll the knob snaps easily into place again could n't be simpler and could n't work better and it fits into the limited space i have on top of the fridge seriously i have to hand it to oxo good grips their products are typically excellent and this one is too
i like the look and the length of this mitt the only drawback is that if you have to hold something hot for longer than 2 or 3 seconds you really start to feel the heat for the price i expected it to protect better
i was looking for a tea kettle for my sister for christmas and could n't find one anywhere finally i tried amazon and came up with a new problem which one to choose amazon had a wide variety of items to choose from their prices were excellent and with their super saver shipping i saved a lot of money shopping online versus a store the kettle came very fast and was everything i wanted it to be it 's not some cheap flimsy tea kettle but the real deal my sister loved it i would definitely recomment using amazon for anything you 're looking for the prices are great and you ca n't beat the convenience
awesome mop the best one i have ever had worth every penny really cleans the floors great
this mop is amazing no stinky chemicals and i have really really clean floors my husband read a bunch of reviews and bought the map based on those reviews we have gone through several mops in the past few years because they could n't hold up to a household with 5 cats i have had standard mops the fancy '' kinds from the grocery store and every other mop out there but this one works i have had this mop for only a few days but i am so impressed i am beyond impressed
i was very dubious about the glowing reviews that this product received from other buyers but i bought one anyway despite what seemed to be a rather hefty price tag for a mop well you can now count me as a true believer this is a great product ! it is very sturdy well manufactured and built for years of service yet during use it feels like half the weight of a traditional cotton head mop when other reviewers say it does a great job of cleaning your floors they are not exaggerating to top it all it could n't be easier to keep clean just toss the easily removable mop head into the washing machine i ca n't imagine anyone being disappointed or regretting the purchase of this fine product do n't let the cost scare you away this is truly a very pleasant exception to the cornucopia of junk littering today 's marketplace my friends tell me that i am always hypercritical and not a person who is easily pleased
this is the most effective and easiest mop i 've ever used ! it effortlessly glides along while cleaning it 's perfect for the environment i love not having to keep buying replacement cleaning supplies and just using water no chemicals ! it 's more sturdy than the cheaper ones not flimsy at all i will always use it ca n't get any easier than this
this mop does an excellent job just with plain water i think it is easier two have two that you can rinse at a time so it goes quicker i am impressed with how much dirt it pulls from linoleum it glides easily and rubs off hard spots i highly recommend it as well as the dust mop
this mop is the best i have purchased we have ceramic tiles and they are a little difficult to get into the grout areas this mop works great and turns into every nook and cranny my daughter told me of this mop she loves hers
i ordered two of these one for a friend and one for myself my first one just died after the first use amazon was wonderful about replacing the unit fast delivery no problems with return ! and i 've been a happy ever since this is a great machine
this waffler makes some great waffles no need to go to go the restaurant anymore for waffles
i bought one of these wafflers after doing more research than the subject warrants i 'm sure my local mom pop carry this line so i purchased it from them the first waffler would n't heat up out of the box so i exchanged it so far so good with the replacement this would be a review if the first unit had worked and if the belgian waffle '' recipe was n't such a waste of supplies first trial using the recipe booklet 's recipe for belgian waffles '' produced some rather inedible results even my son the hoover vacuum thought they were n't very nice the finished waffles were pale and spongy despite being baked at a thermostat setting of 6. second trial run using my tried and true joy of cooking '' basic waffle produced if heavy waffles crispy outsides tender insides the vacuum pronounced them fit to eat and proceeded to tuck away 6 segments or 1.5 total waffles this morning 's recipe used a modified buttermilk waffle recipe from joc '' the results were light and crispy crispy on the outside tender and airy on the inside my son got around two entire waffles modified recipe separate 3 eggs melt a stick of butter whisk the yolks with buttermilk toss together flour cornstarch baking powder baking soda pinch salt optional sugar beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry using a spatula quickly stir the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture then quickly add the melted butter and stir until the batter is mostly smooth fold in eggwhites make waffles
the waffler works great effective for those who the bell reminds me when to add batter or when i must remove a waffle the box mixes come out but more tough the yeast recipe tastes yeasty '' i recommend a recipe with whipped whites lemon juice and cornstarch for lightness freeze well a little more sugar and vanilla for kid friendly waffles a great way to wake up kids in the morning on a busy day
this wafflemaker is very easy to use and makes perfect crisp belgian waffles the recipe that came with the wafflemaker is particularly good waffler lets you know when to start cooking and when to stop if you follow the instructions you get great waffles that do n't stick
makes perfect waffles and we have no complaints so far big fluffy waffles 1.5 inches versus the regular 1.25 inch waffle makers
yes like the other reviewers say it works just as you 'd want it to work i do have a few nits to pick and hence the four stars that i do n't recall anyone else mentioning the cord is really short i suppose it 's designed that way so it can be stored in the base but it only extends 29 '' from the base may or may not be a problem for you depending on where your outlets are the temperature adjustment knob feels really cheap a friend of mine said it feels like it is n't attached to anything i agree but in fact it is i just hope it 's more durable than it feels unlike the waring pro this has no spill tray the plastic base is just to contain spills and crumbs i did n't really have any spills but a removable tray would be nicer if not as attractive made in china not that i 'm opposed to china getting my money but until china does more to protect its workers and environment i prefer my money go to countries that do better on those fronts just my 0.02 the description is incorrect the waffles are 6.5 '' across the top and 7 '' across the middle my favorite topping so far is sliced frozen strawberries thawed of course and fresh real whipped cream elena lisa i followed the instructions to apply oil with a pastry brush and never had a stuck waffle personally i hate aerosol cooking sprays they work but it 's impossible to confine the fine mist they produce to the cooking surface and i rarely want to oil my stove or counter top according to calphalon they use a propellant that can make cookware harder to clean i ca n't confirm the latter but i know that they get an oil film on things i do n't want oiled
i purchased this waffle maker in early december as a gift for my husband who was on a quest for the perfect waffle right out of the box it made the thick fluffy waffles we were hoping it would make they were a full 1 '' thick and crispy on the outside we had found waffle perfection ! i only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that 3 weeks after we started using it it quit heating up however since we had purchased it through the customer service team really stepped up and we had a new waffle maker within a week the new one is producing perfect waffles as well going on 3 weeks now we are hoping that it will continue for a very long time and our first waffle maker just had a manufacturing defect
this was delivered promptly packaged well and looked exactly as i expected it to the only downfall was that one of the beads was broken during shipping but for my purposes it worked well i suppose if i had been using it as a curtain i would not have been pleased that there was a broken bead however it was just what i wanted
this is a doorway curtain not a window curtain the spaces between the strands is exactly as shown it 's a d cor accent not a light blocking tool and i assure you the one i have in my closet door way makes my room feel tropically stylish luv it
the color detail and quality of this set is just perfect i love it and have receieve many compliments on it i intend to purchase another set very happy with set and the manner it was packed and shipped
everything arrived in great condition the set is wonderful ! even better than pictured it was a gift but i may need to order one for myself !
i wanted to check my email before going on line to order another rooster pasta bowl set and this request for a review was in my my husband broke one of the bowls this morning and asked me to order more because he likes them so much i have 2 sets of the dinnerware and a set of the pasta bowls and we love them ! they are truly beautiful
i 'm very happy with this pasta set it exactly matches the dinnerware set and the quality is great the pasta bowl is huge ! i am considering a second set to complete 8 place settings the second pasta bowl would make an excellent salad
this blender is fabulous although pretty expensive i would n't recommend anything else my favorite feature of this blender is the blades they are super heavy and thick and they are not sharp as with other cheaper blenders secondly there is no mistaking when the blender jar is placed correctly on the base because of the construction of the base of the jar lastly the blender starts every cycle with a stir '' setting as to not throw food up into the lid i would definetely recommend this blender as well as any other kitchenaid product it 's worth the extra cash to own the best
this is just what i was looking for thanks again for you are the best !
the shot glass is for a bar and was marked in measurements the price was right it was a gift and was a perfect addition to a new bar
this cutting board does a great job of staying in place while you chop slice or dice the surface is soft enough to protect my cutlery and after hundreds of trips through the dishwasher the rubber is still tacky and no worse for wear my only complaint is that the large handles make the board harder to store and wash
i never know what to do about cutting boards my preference is wood but the upkeep to keep them from warping and in good shape is too much for me the thought of plastic flakes in my food creeps me out but i 'm too clumsy for glass we bought this cutting board when we bought a new knife we do n't have a dishwasher and it is a little unwieldy for the sink however it is great for serving and it actually fits across our sink which is nice for say washing green beans and putting them on the cutting board we bought the smaller version and use it for everyday stuff they have held up well so far and the plastic is pretty tough recommended
this cutting board is all that it is advertized to be i liked mine so much that i went out and bought a smaller version being able to put the cutting board in the dishwasher makes this my favorite cutting board and one that i look forward to using on a daily basis
first i 'd like to say that lodge logic is the greatest no seasoning could it get any better this is a great little pan that does a wonderful job at making perfect little cornbread sticks i 've done them in the oven as well as over coals and they 've turned out fine every time first time they stuck and broke when i took them out but the pan still cleaned fine the only reason i gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because it 's not terribly practical it 'll only cook one small batch at a time 1 cups of cornmeal mix however if you want something really fun and different this is it
saying these glasses are too small is a lot like complaining that shot glass are n't big enough they 're highballs bar glasses made to hold specific styles of drinks mojitos singapore slings cobblers etc and they are the perfect size for that excellent quality
it looks very elegant with full of iced beverage in the sunny afternoon kitchen it feels so good while holding the glass and chatting with friends the distinguish quality has captured every guest in the house the size is just right for such occasions
i weigh flour for waffles and bread to a tenth of an ounce as for the switch it could be a little frustrating if you got one that 's too touchy but mine works fine no regrets
again despite what the first reviewer states this scales does display weight in tenths of an ounce perhaps had it set for weighing in grams i bought this as a postal scale for mailing letters and packages from my home and not for weighing food a 10 lb scale of lesser quality for postal purposes sells for 70 at office depot the only thing that would be nice is a hold '' function commonly found on a postal scale but for the price and swiss quality i can live without it
i do n't know what that other customer is talking about this scale can weigh down to the oz i 've used it for soap making for 3 years now often times measuring in ounces and it is very accurate easy to use and precise
i make lots of costumes particularly period dresses for theater productions and when i finally got desperate for a steamer i went for this one based on these reviews on amazon just wanted to say they did not lead me astray ! it 's perfect for both at home and on the road when i 'm delivering the goods and it 's not given me a hiccup yet highly recommended
it is a brutalistic ugly appliance but it does the job well water well is visible it 's ergonomic and makes just enough steam to finish three wool suits well maybe more like two and a half i was skeptical of the high price but after much research i 'm convinced this is the best travel one available makes other travel steamers look worthless and they are jiffy can charge such a high price because there is no worthy competition nothing comes close
just used the steamer for the first time and was impressed with how well it got up to temperature it produces a good amount of steam for dewrinkling clothes but keep in mind this is for short term use you will have to refill several times if you need to do several articles of clothing the reason i purchased this was to block sweater pannels after knitting i will need to send this gem back because the instruction clearly specify that you must keep the steamer verticle you ca n't use this with your clothing article on a table your item must be hanging
this light weight travel steamer has saved me many dollars for the price of what i would have paid a hotel valet service to press my suitcase wrinkled clothes i could probably have room service breakfasts ! the esteam made quick work of the folds in a gabardine skirt and spiffed up the collars of many a blouse and jacket while esteam has become a for our travel it has also become a standby at home we do have the which is great but because of the easy maneuverability of the hand held steamer i find that we use it more often try as i might a steam iron was leaving shiny spots on a taffeta skirt the steamer smooths wrinkles with no trace whatsoever there is a silk table skirt that we love but it was impossible to get it home from the cleaners unwrinkled esteam to the rescue the uses we 've found for it are countless it 's simply one of those household items we now wonder how we ever did without we like the wide mouth on the water tank which makes it easy to fill and the fact that we can use plain or distilled water the handle is ergonomically friendly and the nine foot cord allows us to move about as much as needed thanks to jiffy esteamer wrinkles are no longer a pressing issue for us
firstly provides a much better price on this product than amazon secondly i write this review based on a holiday experience in which i utilized the steamer on a diurnal basis pros 5 minute warm up period uses hard or soft water compact and durable does an adequate job of steaming dress slacks trenchcoats jeans ties and dress slacks 800 watts of output power most powerful portable steamer out there never clogs lengthy power cord and easy instructions steams vertically as well as horizontally really ! and balanced cons goes through quickly which is a testimony of its steaming power and the limited water chamber no switch only 4 steaming vents bores steaming head collects dirt and lint promptly easily have to purchase plug converters separately utterly stupid since this unit is designed for the traveler it 's always about and aesthetically unattractive is it quicker and more efficient than a clothes iron are the results better than a clothes iron in my humble opinion sometimes yes sometimes no for trenchcoats ties suit coats jackets and jeans this steamer definitely has the edge for dress slacks and dress shirts the jury 's still out as it stands right now i would have to say no '' all in all it is a wise investment with ample potential hope this helps
this steamer works great on light fabrics such as silk however when i tried steaming my cotton dress shirts it took forever just to get a couple of wrinkles out for its small size and price i 'm fairly satisfied with this steamer but do n't expect it to replace your iron
i compared this travel model with the steamer they were both very good at removing wrinkles from clothing we steamed a full week 's wardrobe and the clothing done with the travel steamer looked just as good as the others the only drawback to the travel model is related to its small size it needs to be refilled every garments and the smaller steam head means that it takes longer to steam an item however i actually found that the small steam head worked better on small areas like collars and cuffs especially since it has squared corners the corners mean that you do have to be a bit careful with delicate knits though worth the price if you really need to look your best when you travel
the hostess set is the perfect completion to this beautiful flatware set
i purchased the carafe to use with my french press it works very well keeping the coffee hot for several hours construction fit and finish are all up to standard i find that it keeps my coffee hot longer if i first the carafe with boiling water for a few minutes good value for the money
this carafe is inexpensive and keeps the liquid hot for at least 12 hours the only problem was that it had scratches and little stains on the lid and the surrounding area even though it was delivered perfectly packaged i am guessing amazon sent me a returned item not properly check two out of three items in that order came with scratches ! i am a new customer and this is very disappointing since up to now i did not have any problems with other sellers i am not returning it because my previous carafe guzzini after six months began to leak so i need the carafe now
i was originally going to sink a lot of money into some sort of airpot but i found this while looking for a rice cooker and could n't resist the low price wow i 'm amazed at how long this keeps liquids hot ! hours and hours ! no leaks the top is a snap i agree with the reviewer who made the comment about fussy caraffe kids this is a great item i 'm glad i bought it
i put boiling hot water in this carafe at and at it still comes out steaming i 've had it for one year and it still amazes me i 've had no leakage or dribbling problems the metal black body is sleek looking and has no fingerprints on it since i usually hold on to the handle or the top that are plastic my only problem is having enough tea bags to keep up with it all day ! i 'm working on that five stars for
i 've been using my zojirushi carafe for about a month now and i believe it 's awesome like the other reviews here note it keeps your beverage hot for hours for the money it 's a great deal i 'm using my zojirushi along with the manual drip coffee filter cone by rsvp can be found here on amazon if you 've never tried manual drip i recommend you give it a shot
my husband wanted something to take his coffee to work after doing some research and seeing the ratings this item received on amazon i gave it to him for christmas he absolutely loves it one morning he filled it up with hot water so it could later be ready for the coffee and he forgot all about it when i was getting ready to do dishes at about i poured out the water and it was still steaming hot i highly recommend this to anyone we have not had any leaking problems like some other reviewers
the ice cubes come out intact not chipped or cracked to get them out push each cube from the bottom with your finger for fastest and easiest results wait for 5 minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer this way the ice cubes will pop right out if you do n't wait your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out
if you do n't have an these are convenient the ice pops out easily my only frustrations were that i wanted pieces than i got that i wished it had a harder form to sit in so that it would n't splash or twist funny on the way to the freezer shelf
this is without exaggeration the greatest knife ever made i have some decent enough knives that i 've used before sabatier but this makes my other chef 's knife look like an idiot it is so effortless to use and such a pleasure seriously your food will practically cut itself with this knife your vegetables will part themselves and the fat will slice itself away from your meats i 've always loved chopping food ever since i learned how but this raises the act from an enjoyable necessity past hobby and into the realm of culinary bliss
this is a very egg slicer which i like but it is very hard to clean there are very deep crevices and many nooks and crannies for egg to get caught in nevertheless it is worth it to have an egg slicer with wires and other parts that wo n't get bent out of shape
this egg '' slicer is great ! not only does it slice eggs it also slice mushrooms perfectly much better than a food processor and more even slices than by hand and quicker too i used this slicer to slice the mushrooms for a pork dish for 150 people and it was quick and the slices were all uniform and neat heavy duty too well worth the price
i have had the capresso for just about 2 years see my earlier rating it is worth it 's weight in gold the coffee is terrific have no desire to stop at starbucks on the way home from work for my usual evening caffiene fix the customer service has been terrific last week the steam knob was stuck and did not turn to open since the warranty period of 1 year was over i was concerned about having to spend a huge amount to get it fixed i tried cleaning the knob thinking maybe some milk splatters and grunge had crusted underneath i also tried wd 40 no avail when i called customer service i spoke with 'gunther ' who kindly walked me through prying off the knob and replacing it now it works perfectly ! the machine is operated by my 10 and 12 year olds as well as my cleaning lady and sitter it has never failed a reproducible cup of coffee pretty much each time on a rare occasion the coffee is luke warm and has to be discarded i have learnt the machines little nuances and can tweak the settings to make a perfect cup i always use whole beans i have found that when i use ground coffee i have to put in a tremendous amount per cup brewed i also have only used non flavored coffee beans the frother can get pretty crusted so i usually take it apart and soak it in warm soapy water every other day on occasion if it is not reattached well it can pop off while steaming and make a bit of a mess and possible scald you be careful that has happened once or twice and was probably why the steam knob got stuck with dried milk at any rate the jura capresso gets 5 stars from me at the 2 year mark
after staying with friends and enjoying a morning cup of coffee from their machine i decided to purchase my own after a month of now owning my machine i can not express how much i enjoy the ability to make a perfect cup of coffee the machine works very well and i have had no problems with it i received the optional siphoning attachment to make latte 's and hot hot milk drinks this also works well for heating the milk prior to putting in the coffee my only question is whether to purchase the after sale factory extended warranty as it is rather pricey
i 've been using this machine for a couple of months now and so far so good the espresso is rich and tasty i 've used starbucks beans as well as coffee bean tea leaf '' beans and have had no problems with them at all i have found that if i run the rinse cycle a little more frequently i get better espresso the only downside i 've seen is the size of the water tank the machine will say it 's out of water well before it 's empty so the usable volume of the tank is much less than what they state as the size
i actually have the capresso but was also experiencing problems with the frother i took the tip posted by another reader and switched out the existing frothing tip with a krups frothing tip i had an old krups machine left over before i upgraded to the capresso what do you know it totally worked ! the froth is sooooo much better with the new tip !
i ca n't say a lot about this machine that has n't already been said the build quality is excellent and the coffee is the best i 've ever had consistently i had avoided automatics for a while simply because pulling a shot seemed like such a romantic notion hah ! switching to a schedule that kicks off at am makes anything 'automatic ' look a whole lot sexier i am setting aside so that when this one finally fails and that should be a while this machine demonstrates superior engineering i can dart right to the store and buy another and although i think microfoam might be another romantic notion if it tastes good and wakes me up i 'm good the previous reviewer might want to check his or her water quality i have deliciously pure backwoods north carolina well water that gives me superb crema
this machine is outstanding however this is just a version of the which is less expensive they both do anything and everything you would want to do if you 're a coffee snob so unless you 're trying to match other shiney silver stuff in your kitchen save a couple hundred and get an
after 7 years or so of using a bulletproof starbucks barista which produced great espresso and copious microfoam i bought this machine for my wife for christmas although she swears it was yet another gift to myself the build quality and ease of use is great the espresso is very good but not up to the standards of a well pulled shot off a nevertheless the lack of any mess and pushbutton convenience outweighs any complaints about the quality of the shot do n't get me wrong it pulls a very nice shot what it doesnt do well is create the beautiful microfoam an experienced user can get using a traditional steam wand all of these have that annoying wand which is supposed to require no skill to create foam unfortunately all it does it create these large crappy bubbles and very little foam to make matters worse the side steam holes get clogged very easily and then the result is no foam i called wholelattelove and capresso looking for a solution and they each had no clue either a how to solve the problem or b why in the world i didnt like the crappy large soap bubble excuse for microfoam well for 8 i found a krups metal steam tip off the net go to for a 1.99 steam tip plus 6 shipping and screwed it on to the end of the metal wand after having discarded the useless steaming aid sleeve and old plastic tip and voila ! awesome foam made in half the time i could do the same thing with my old starbucks barista these machines all have a thermoblock for steaming unlike the traditional boiler on a better nevertheless it is enough and the foam is first rate as i said the only other thing to be aware of is that these machines cant use my beloved peats coffee beans too oily and they get stuck in the so i am still searching for a good dark roast which is not too oily but for now after a month of use i am happy with the espresso and the foam and delighted to make my morning cap with a minimum of effort the in particular is a great machine as against the other juras it is more programmible than the and much simpler to use and smaller footprint than the pricier units i almost bought the but there is just too much to think about on that machine and the bright chrome is a bit too shiny and pretentious the is the perfect mix of functionality and understated good looks it is also the newest technology from jura so it has some small touches that the doesnt have such as a 120 second steam timer versus the 60 second timer on the update to the above review after many more months of use i am loving the jura and i found the beans to use blue bottle coffee hayes valley espresso not too oily but very flavorful perfect for this machine better than peats and definitely fresher i am not going to list their website here cause i dont want to look like a shill for them but you can find them i am confident they will mail out to you for no additional cost by the way the review above that says the is a shinier version of the is incorrect the basic mechanism may be the same but the programming functions and other nice features are significantly different if you 're already spending this much coin the is a better deal than the just my humble opinion
i got the impressa for mother 's day and it has changed my life around ! the coffee is predictably par excellence and both my husband and i have no desire to go out for coffee anymore in fact when we are out we would rather come home than go to starbucks the machine seemed formidable at first i find any thing with manuals to be intimidating but after reading the manual and trying out the a few times i got it right i have since perfected the art of frothing and steaming it comes with a video though i did not watch it cons has a fairly large foot print a lot of counter space flavored coffee beans can not be used in the grinder to do with the oils because of this i have switched from hazelnut coffee to unflavored coffee and frankly the coffee is so good that i do n't miss the flavored kind the accessories such as the water filter and the cleaning tablets are not easily available have to order them directly from capresso or from williams and sonoma finally although this is a somewhat expensive machine 1400 we have recovered half the cost of the machine over the past 3 months by not going to specialty coffee stores and spending 3 for each cup hope you find this review helpful k
i am not a coffee shop expert so my expectations may be different than yours my needs were the following when considering buying this machine 1. consistant coffee shop taste and quality 2. easy to use 3. easy clean up 4. an intelligent machine 5. well built this machine is really cool it makes the whole coffee making process so simple the results are fabulous everything comes out nice and hot the machine is very intelligent with a lot of cool little features in place to make your life easier the frother works great setup was a breeze i got it on for 853.00 brand new from a marketplace seller a great deal it was !
i donate feliway to our local humane society and have educated them on how to use it to reduce stress by applying it in the cages i also volunteer and take photos of the cats i have found by applying a small amount to each arm it is easier to get timid cats out of the cages i have also used this product in our home to help with introducing new cats to existing ones and to eliminate spraying problems by a female i highly recommend it
fastest shipping ever ! thank you so much we will buy from you again
one of our two cats has chronic litter box problems i have done tons of research and taken him to the vet numerous times tried special litter and special food even considered medication then the vet suggested feliway i was amazed ! my cat completely stopped urinating on my living room carpet and actually began choosing a sandbox over the carpet within two to three weeks of consistent use of feliway spray i do n't have any idea why this product works i just know it does work you have to be very consistent with it and reapply to the problem spots every day but it does work it even works if i catch my cat looking for a place to go on the carpet once i spray the feliway he will literally walk away from the carpet and use the box instead from other reviews it seems feliway does n't work for all cats but for us it has been a life saver our cat has always had a nervous personality so maybe it works better for anxious kitties also it seems the spray and the diffuser do n't work the same we tried the diffuser too but our cat seems to need it sprayed directly on the problem spot i really recommend this product try both formulas and just be patient and you may get the results i have !
hi everyone last friday tazz our male cat was attacked in our yard by a loose dog needless to say i rushed him to the hospital friday afternoon and upon the initial examination the vet did not find any external damage the next day i gave tazz a bath because he was covered in urine from the attack and that is when i noticed a lump on his right rear hip i took him to another emergency hospital at which they did an ultra sound of his hip and found he has a hematoma fluid in his hip the vet gave me some liquid to give him but he is still in pain and you can see it when he tries to jump or climb in addition his whole demeanor has changed to being scared of the slightest noise or movement he hides frequently and does not talk meow anymore my veterinarian recommended feliaway spray which the veterinarian said would help with his anxiety in addition to helping him heal from the emotional trauma of the attack i received the feliaway today in the mail and after spraying it on a couple of places where tazz frequents i must say his attitude is very much improved i would highly recommend this product even though it is a bit pricey it just takes a wee bit for it to have an effect call it aromatherapy for cats whatever the case if can help a cat after a dog attack then i say it 's a product that deserves high marks
this stuff stopped my cat from peeing all over the furniture which started after bringing a new cat into my home also spraying it on furniture the cats claw up stops them from doing it no cat owner should be without this
i used this product in combination with sticky paws found on amazon and both vertical and horizontal scratching posts we bought two new upholstered chairs 3 weeks ago and my 3 boys have n't touched them ! ! this is a great product and i will buy it again two paws up !
i love this product ! we use it mainly for grinding chicken breasts i find it very easy to use and extremely easy to clean up
this grinder does just what it says it is fast and easy to use simple to assemble and disassemble and easy to clean and maintain i just received this yesterday and today i ground approx 30 lbs of meat with it i did it about 5 lbs at a time i did let it rest between each load '' it did n't overheat or even get hot i would recommend this grinder to anyone for home use
i love steamed fish this steamer is a wide flat stable place to put my plate for steaming i tried to use my vegetable steamer with the post removed but it just was n't stable enough this is perfect we also steamed a few tamales left in the freezer from christmas i 'm sure you could steam other things like buns or vegetables but i have n't tried those yet also a big plus is that it stores in the wok so it does n't take up space in the kitchen delivery was very fast as well
i got this because i saw rachel use it on her food network show i watched her show occasionally and i like her and some of her ideas although i am not a devoted follower i use this pan to make meat sauce for spaghetti to brown chicken for my mom 's shrimp creole to stir fry to saut vegetables fry chicken wings pan fry cornbread and to make two grilled cheese sandwiches when both my boys are hungry and ca n't wait this pan does it all the center stays hotter so you can cook food in the center and move it to the ends to keep it warm the shape also makes it easier to handle i cook on a gas cook top with 5 burners and the oval shape is easier to maneuver when using all the burners and having handles of both sides makes moving the pan easy even when it is full it also cleans up easily as you would expect of a pan there are two rivets inside the pan where the handle attaches the rivets are not if you know that food will touch the rivets i suggest spraying the rivets with oil before cooking this will make clean up easier this is a great heavy duty pot and the glass top is nice so you can see how the food is cooking without taking the top off and altering the cooking temperature i also like the look of these rachel ray pots her other line has handles the color of safety orange that remind you of construction cones i am not sure why anyone would think that looks attractive in a kitchen i also purchased the oval pasta pot and the lids are which is great if you are cooking something that requires a taller lid the price on this pot went up and down as high as 99.00 and as low as 65.00 a friend who is a longtime amazon shopper suggested putting it in my cart and waiting until it hit a good price to purchase it i did i got it at a good price and i am happy quality pan easy to clean and looks nice no safety cone orange this is a great choice
i had looked at the oval saute pan for quite awhile i 'm a rachel ray fan so i 'd seen her use it too frequently i found my pans bumping each other on my stove top and i have a large stove top i decided to try the oval pan and it did n't disappoint it cooks evenly and is easy to it holds a ton of food another plus for me since i often double recipes i would highly recommend this product and plan to purchase addition anolon pans
i did some research on pans because i wanted some for christmas to replace the old ones i have a 10 inch skillet 4.5 quart sauce and 5 quart oval pans and they are best pans i 've ever owned what i love about them 1. mine do not have any sticking issues what so ever 2. they clean extremely easy and fast via hand washing no hard scrubbing at all 3. since it only takes seconds to clean i can reuse to cook something else without any flavor from the previous meal 4. the handles do not get hot and they have a good grip i have the silicone rubber handles 5. they apparently can be put in the oven up to 350 degrees but i have not tried that yet 6. they are not as heavy as some professional ones i would recommend buying this brand con if i had to say anything bad about them the only thing i can think of is the rivets that are inside the pan that attach the handle to the pan can get food stuck around them so you really have to clean around that area good i wish they would have just attached the handle to the outside of the pan
i 'm also surprised at some of the reviews i love this pan i have a full set of kitchenaid pans that i bought about 3 years ago and just adore and i thought i 'd add another chef 's skillet since i cook a lot the oval shape of this pan interested me this pan is terrific and has been getting almost daily use since i bought it about 3 weeks ago it works well on my ceramic cooktop cleans nicely and is quite versatile i should mention that analon makes a product made specially for cookware which i bought a few months ago and that does a terrific job of removing the little scratches on the cookware as well as cleaning any discolorations so i 'd recommend looking for that if you find that your pans are looking scratched
i agree that this pan would do much better on a gas stove i wish i had a gas stove but i still love this pan it 's big enough to hold a lot of food and the handle is to 375 degrees i used it in the oven to bake chicken with 40 cloves of garlic '' at 350 degrees for an hour and a half and had no problems whatsoever and i did not cover the handle it is a tad on the heavy side but it 's still easy to lift with the helper handle and i have wicked tendonitis in my elbows i would recommend this pan to anyone and i hope to get the matching pasta pot soon
i cook every single day i 'm told i 'm an excellent cook trying different dishes complex and simple i like rr 's recipes but ca n't stand to watch her anymore this pan as well as the large pasta pot also oval looked like good ideas and i got them i love them i want a second saute pan i have n't had a single issue with the pan i love how you can move things that are cooking too quickly to a far corner and move other things to the center where the most heat is i saute fry and cook many many things in this pan and have no problems the pasta pot is perfect for boiling spaghetti and other pasta products no sticking whatsoever and i can get 4 pots on the stove top with these two pans
item was satisfactory but thought it was bigger probably my mistak
great size for a small to moderate serving fiestaware has been a good find and value for our family 2 generations as all the place setting colors we have are still available 24 colors we have been able to replace anything that has been broken plus add different pieces just added these bowls to the original 2 colors to which we atarted our home mixing colors makes for a variety of beautiful table settings for seasons and hoidays
these are called fruit bowl '' but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream
perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who do n't like their food all running together on your plate good for snacks like pudding and jello also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing plus it wo n't take up alot of space on your table this is a very nice color
i have several of these bowls and use them frequently they are the perfect size for snacks i also use them frequently for food prep tasks when i 'm cooking they 're a good size to hold a to one cup of a dry ingredient and of course they are the perfect size for their intended purpose fruit i find myself putting fruit on the table more often now that i have these bowls a cereal sized bowl seems like a lot of dish for one serving of fruit this smaller size prevents clutter on the table especially if you are serving salad and bread on individual dishes
i did what you 're doing now and read these reviews from my perspective this is the single greatest travel mug on the market one reviewer mentioned that it does n't stay warm long enough however my stays respectably warm for at least an hour usually more there is something truly satisfying about tossing a full travel mug of coffee onto the floor of your car if you 're in a hurry or placing it in your backpack between classes and neeever worrying about it spilling pure genius ! my only complaint is that the handle is n't conducive to the cupholder in my mazda 6. the handle extends too far down which causes it to get in the way of my center console i can only stabilize it in the cupholder if both cupholes are empty but since it 's leak proof i have no problem setting it on the seat next to me
i have had only good experiences with this travel mug as well as with other trudeau insulated products the 360 degree drinking meaning you can drink from any side is a good feature the mug needs to be opened with two hands so not good for people who want to open and close it while driving the black finish is very sleek but is n't a tough finish if the mug is going to be banged around i have seen ones in stores with scratches on them
i have had the more travel mugs and thought that they were the best well i was wrong this travel mug is by far the best out there it is truly my friends get tired of me turning it upside down i guess i 'm easily amused hehe but i really do like a mug that wo n't spill if tipped over when turned to the drink side the liquid flows at about the right rate not too fast not too slow anyway i ca n't say enough about this mug and the price also beats the competition
i love the curved handle it feels great ! this company knows what they are doing ! ! ! i put up two towel bars one above the other and hung on hooks all of their tools and gagets
do n't expect this to be the same quality as corningware it is n't lots of useful pieces not positive about quality re how they will hold up but the range of sizes offers lots of options
all the pieces are great the sizes durability functionality etc i ordered to add to some previously purchased pieces my only complaint '' is that the pieces are really beige not white but in reality so what the big deal if they do n't match right ! ! ! it 's well worth the price i paid
i gave this as a christmas gift to my mom she has always used glass and metal bakeware for the price it was a steal
this is an excellent set and a fantastic bargain it is perfect for someone who is just outfitting a kitchen i am going to use it as a shower gift i notice it is currently unavailable but if and when it is available do n't hesitate to snap one up i might even get a set for myself
the only reason i didnt give this set another star is because i havent actually tried them yet but they are fantastic looking seem very durable and well worth the 26.99 i paid for them you can tell just by looking at them that they are well worth this price and more ! i bought these for myself as an early christmas gift and am really looking forward to trying these out
this cookware is so wonderful that i ca n't find the words to describe it ! not only is is absolutely gorgeous in classic white but it does everything the manufactor says kinda rare these days ! im so happy i took the chance and purchased two sets at 25 its already made thanksgiving cooking so much easier and elegant ! thank you amazon for a winner
i snapped up this set when it got marked down under 30 mainly because i needed ramekins and some casserole dishes with lids i have n't actually in them yet but they look great and i 'm looking forward to trying them out the only thing that perplexed me was when the box arrived it said on the side ship to qvc germany which i thought was kind of odd inside i located instructions but unfortunately they were in german and since i only had semester of the german language in junior high school i have no idea what the instructions say to do but i can live with that feeling i got an awesome deal on a nice looking set
look i consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to ceramic bakeware sets i 've tried them all the set from luber corporation falls short and do n't even get me started on cerama what a disaster ! ! if you 're serious about laying down a little bit of your hard earned cashed for ceramic bakeware make sure you grab this nifty 11 piece set from the good folks at meyer they wo n't let you down this will handle all your baking needs from the every day to the extra special circumstances none of the competitors can match up and in case you did n't notice it comes in white ! ! no more crummy colors like electric green or fuschia just good old classic white like grandma used to use
works like a charm great for pizza and homemade bread and biscuits
bought this set after many years of homemade pizzas in deep dish pans too high in carbs so we thought about a pizza stone for thinner crust pizzas this set works great heat the stone for 20 minutes while the dough is rising on the peel and you 're layering your ingredients then slide it onto the stone for minutes great pizza just like a pizza cafe ! !
arrived very fast and am looking forward to using it for a long time
what can i say it fits perfectly over the pan and covers all the contents
i received my chair and it was missing a side panel the chair was hard to put together the chair is of quality and very comfortable
this is a great chair and especially at this price i bought one a year ago and paid more and thought i got a good deal then i purchased another 2 months ago on sale and was i ever happy this is a very comfortable chair easy to put together and the fabric is great liquids just bead up this is a fine chair !
our beagle and our lab are both heavy we saw the video for the furminator in our local petstore and thought we 'd see if it might help normally we use a regular brush and a slicker brush and there 's still hair floating around all the time on the advice of the cashier we used it outside for the first time good idea ! i have n't seen that much fluff come off of any animal before other than shearing sheep ! both dogs loved it no pain no fuss and their coats look wonderful best of all there 's hardly any hair in the house these days our lawn however looks like a dog i recommend this to anyone whose dog fits the list of appropriate shedding '' breeds it 's completely amazing
i have two cats one is a shedder the other a short haired tabby this has worked great on both of the cats i already notice after using it a few weeks i can actually pet the female cat now without getting hair all over the place the hardest thing with it is the static created with the brushing then the hair wants to stick to my hands while i pull it off not a problem compared to the benefits
hair all ovah sick of sweepin fuggeddaboudit and do n't listen to that wuss who complained about the hair flyin in her face what a wuss all ya haffta do wid dis ding is gently pull it over your kitty 's back and baddaging baddabang no more loose hayah in all seriousness folks i was amazed at how well this worked and it will certainly cut down on the daily clean up of shed hair from any shedding pet my cat loves it too so there ya go take it from a soprano
i could n't belive how much hair came out of my dog lab especially compared to a conventional comb her coat actually felt thinner i can not say my house has no dog hair but it has decreased dramatically less vacuuming less frustration and more time to spend with zeppy ! i highly recommend the furminator
this dog rake is the best i have ever used my dog is a chow chow so lots of thick winter undercoat needed to come out i get lots more hair in much less time i had broken my arm so i did n't have the strength to comb my dog this spring the groomer suggested i get the furminator wow ! it was so much easier this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone with a dog that has a thick undercoat
i was stunned by how much hair this thing took off ! i have 2 welsh corgi 's and most brushes just run over their surface hair but the furminator brought out all the fine underneath hair i just love it and have told all my dog loving friends about it my aunt bought one and then ordered another for my cousin
i recommend this item for anyone who enjoys wine but does n't have the manual ability to deal with the hard to use corkscrew gadgets i appreciate the easy grip on the top and the way the screw part does n't jam with the cork i initially was introduced to the oxo good grips line through a family member with multiple sclerosis the good grips products seemed to be the only thing she could easily use and that would not break easily when dropped i quickly learned however that the line of products is not limited to use by folks with dexterity issues and have since fallen in kitchen love with my various oxo food gadgets
the oxo corkscrew consists of a black plastic corkscrew that screws down into the cork surrounded by a black plastic surround with handles and a wide but maybe this will make more sense if i try to explain how you use it you raise the handles which lifts up the surround exposing the corkscrew you grasp the handle at the top press the tip of the corkscrew against the cork and twist pushing so that the corkscrew enters into the cork and spirals down through it once it 's firmly embedded you grasp the handles and push them down this lowers the surround and raises the corkscrew pulling the cork free of the bottle disadvantages it 's easy to get the corkscrew and end up having to start over advantages the give you so much leverage that it 's child 's play to get most corks out of their bottles this is absolutely fantastic for those of us with this is one of the few oxo items we have that has n't in some way broken down admittedly we do n't use it as often as some items but it has certainly withstood what use we have put it through it 's a design that makes opening bottles very easy on my hands despite my tendonitis i only occasionally have troubles with the corkscrew going in i think because the surround can partially block your view of the corkscrew as you put it in and the distance between handle and corkscrew tip decreases accuracy and it is n't that large of a problem
if you are familiar with the le creuset brand you will already know the quality this is fantastic quality cookware the beauty of buying it from amazon is the price i purchased this set when it was on sale for 179.99 at that time they also had a promotion for ramakins and a free set of spatula 's and canister items totalling around 95 ! ! so that just made the deal extra special all i can say is if they have a similar promotion running in future you should jump on it as you wont find such quality items at the same great price anywhere else ! !
this set is really nice it warms up super fast and retains heat longer due to the cast iron it looks wonderful hanging in my kitchen too ! ! the pots have been used heavily and still no chips cleans up super easy with soap and water i have never tried the dishwasher it is a heavy set but the bestest of quality
i received this water filter two days after i placed the order i 'm happy with the fast service as for the water filter you might want to consider rinsing it after taking it out from the package before inserting it into the coffee maker also i ran water through the coffee maker twice before making the first pot of coffee for the peace of mind if you have paper filter placed before running the water you will be able to see little green particals in it at the end of the process
our water is just horrible prior to purchasing this coffee maker and several of the little filters i would just replace coffee makers every couple of months no amount of cleaning would help i loved this coffee maker and have been really upset because i ca n't find the filters glad to find them here ! !
i have had the braun coffee maker for 6 years and enjoy the great tasting coffee that the braun filter produces with this coffee maker it is easy and convenient to use and i would not make any coffee without it however the filters are a bit difficult to find in my area
you 're supposed to replace these filters every two months i could n't find them in a store anywhere and tried ordering them online directly from the manufacturer but i guess my order was lost somewhere in cyberspace amazon to the rescue ! i have finally replaced my coffee maker water filter after 2 years and that 's a good thing
the water filter is inexpensive and pretty serves the purpose and light on your
i really like this new version of the oxo good grips pepper mill it works great better than the old one
i bought this pepper grinder because i love oxo products and i also have carpel tunnel and arthritis in my hands i do n't really care for pepper but when i buy it i buy a combination of coarse pepper and sea salt i love the little window that you open to fill it as well as being able to see how much is in there i also like the cap on the bottom so it keeps it clean sitting on my stovetop but most of all i like the knob to grind the spice i have mine set on fine grind but it is adjustable i think you could use it for any spice you want to grind not just pepper it is fun and easy to use and looks nice sitting on my stove i love this gadget !
have not had it for very long i have arthritis and it is easy for me to use
we had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy i love to cook and if you 're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground in addition i have carpal tunnel so not only was i frustrated it was painful too ! i did n't particularly want to spend 100 to get a really good '' pepper mill this pepper mill like all the oxo products i 've tried is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency thank goodness there are companies like oxo
this is not the only peppermill i own but it is the only one i 'll use i hate to admit it but i have walked into the dining room to retrieve this baby even though a perfectly usable mill was right in the kitchen cupboad in front of me i did not intend to become such a peppermill snob but this is such a well designed tool that i can no longer settle for using the old ones all previous mill suffered from similar problems which oxo has solved in maryland humidity is always a problem for peppermills not for this one through the dog days of august when other mills are just mashing peppers into a gummy paste and clogging to the point where you will gladly settle to a year old can of ground pepper this mill produces a talc fine powder i 've read that other people have trouble getting a fine grind you can not just crank down on the adjustment nut to get a fine grind your have to turn the crank counter clockwise as you tighten the adjuster this helps clear the mechanism if you do n't do this the larger peppercorns block the mechanism from closing down all the way once you get the hang of how to adjust this mill it will provide copiuous quantities of pepper from extra cource to super fine the easy grip handle eliminates all the wasted motion associated with tradional mill i make my own barbeque rub and always hated grinding enough pepper for the recipe most mills only grind correctly in one direction so you twist the knob release it reposition your grip and twist again half your motion is wasted now thanks to the easy grip handle i can crank out tablespoons of pepper in seconds when i 'm done i set the mill back on it base so there is no pepper dust in my spice cabinet if you believe that form follows function this is a beautiful tool if you need more status from you peppermill get a solid walnut mill or a brushed aluminum mill from another manufacturer just do n't expect it to out perform this classic
i have purchased several other pepper grinders out there and this one is by far the is inexpensive and can grind pepper at is a life saver when you are cooking and seasoning with large amounts of pepper no more sore forearms from twisting or squeezing those unproductive pepper grinders out there this thing rocks !
just as with the vac filter these do the job they were designed to do and do it not badly more notable is the fact that i 've never heard wife cussing when using them so they must work out ok
the pads work great large and easy to put on wish the vacuum was bit more powerful but overall a good quick cleanup product
this is another gorgeous piece by fiesta it is lovely and functional my only issue is that the dimensions state it is 12 '' tall when it is really less than 8 '' ! ! ! so beautiful but small
i purchased the turquoise and sunflower a while back and just recently ordered the cobalt and cinnabar i loved this carafe especially when serving weekend brunches even with just my family of four we feel fancy using the different fiestawares and that is really special to my old i use this for water orange juice or whatever kind of juice you want and it just makes the table a little more festive the only thing i was surprised when i got this was i thought it would be a little bigger other than that it is absolutely beautiful and i do n't mind having it in more colors than i already have
the photo does not do this piece justice ! my jaw dropped when i first pulled it out of the box the color is beautiful as is the styling it feels good in hand and is as sturdy as fiestaware 's reputation i have n't however used it yet but from years of experience with this company 's pieces i 'm betting on it 's efficiency
i love the carafe and would like to know if you will receive this one in shamrock green because i am wanting to purchase 4 different colors please respond
i ordered two of these great fiesta handled carafes in black i plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so i had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase i have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces i was not happy when i received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips where the white under the glaze shows through as well as scratches in the glaze which i have never seen before and ca n't imagine what happened to put them there in my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds i love the pieces i 'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish i also received a black covered butter which was blemish free
i have the circulon elite set and purchased this pot to go with that set it 's bigger than the saucepans that come in the set so it 's a nice addition it 's a bit taller and narrower than other saucepans of similar size which i find helps to balance the pan when it 's full and i 'm lifting it between the stove and other locations it heats evenly and it seems to be of good quality
great addition to my set of these pots pans it 's nice to have the glass tops to peek inside the rubberize handles make them nice to use everything cooks even and is easy to clean up
it is very functional from table top frig microwave and even to oven
looks good works in convection or microwave comes with lid decent price
i purchased two of these bowls years ago and they have held up well i use them more than any of my tupperware because they can go straight from the fridge to the microwave and in to the dishwasher i was very pleased to find that amazon had them so i ordered another the only reason i did n't rate this 5 stars is because the new lid seems to be a cheaper quality than the older ones i already own would definately recommend this bowl to anyone looking for a good bowl
a great storage container since it 's glass you can store without worry of discoloration
i cook and freeze a lot of meals for my husband who often works late i wo n't use tupperware or other plastic because i believe plastic can leach into food while microwaving but pyrex bowls of this size are hard to find in stores most stores have pyrex baking sets with several containers that are too large or too small finally i can buy just these bowls as many as i want without getting stuck with other sizes i do n't need this is a great price for them too on ebay people want more plus shipping
was looking for clear bowls so i can see the contents while heating in the microwave and prevent foods from boiling over these fit the bill perfectly and i use them to make my oatmeal in the morning or to heat up small quantities of sauces the bowls are also nice enough to serve from or eat from and they can also be put in the regular oven or freezer to store foods simply great and the price is right !
this one is very nice serve and store hold good 3 cups ! really good for the price 2.99 lesser than the outlet price ! good buying !
it 's conveniently sized for a number of daily kitchen activities from mixing in a bowl to scraping out the last remnants of cream cheese and it 's not flimsy at all even though the whole seemless piece is silicon in fact it 's sturdy and comfortable in the hands i do n't use it for heated applications so i ca n't tell you how it performs at high
wonderful little thing ! works great ! easy to clean ! remember the regular one i have to pull out the spatula head and clean the hole where the stick goes into it gets yucky after a period of time the one is excellent there is no separable part no clean corners ! the whole thing is solid firm and easy to manipulate ! wonderful wonderful wonderful ! ! ! love it ! love it ! love it ! ! ! every kitchen should be equiped one ! !
sheets are comfortable and they look very i doubt it will last more than 5 washes to meet the my durability standards for a 600 thread count
these sheets are soooo soft and the price i payed you could not find anywhere just get them you wo n't be sorr
do n't listen to the reviews about it not fitting and the sheets smelling funny i have a queen extra full pillow top and tehy fit fine ! the only things i did find is that you should dry them with low heat insted of high heat and they werent quite as soft as i though but over all i love them the sheets do not have a weird smell to them they smell like anything new i would suggest getting them they are great
i have a 4 year old 20 lbs boston terrier male little man was entertained for almost 2 hours with the treat ball loved it
our little rat terrier can usually make a ten minute snack out of the biggest rawhide treats this thing has kept him very busy for three to four days on a refil and the main ingredients are not nearly as likely to clog his pipes the inserts force him to clean his teeth and he can not put it down does not seem to even be interested in chewing the container looks hocus but i tell you this thing is grreat
great pan i had a hard time finding some of these sizes
i really lilke the springform pan the offset surface allowed me to remove my cheesecake from the pan with easem and the dark surface aborbed more heat in the oven and there was better color on the cheesecake than that of other pans i have used the size was just perfect for a small cheesecake so if you do n't bake much and do n't want to have a lot of leftovers buy this pan just remember to scale down the recipe accordingly a note of caution i am not the athority on whether or not it is actually leak proof it has been my experiencee that all springform pans leak so i always wrap them in tin foil the pan did show the least traces of leakage of the springform pans i have though
after having my cat fod raided for the third time by our resident horse i went looking for a container that would be space saving and secure for storing food this fit the bill perfectly now he is no longer able to have unauthorized snacks and i am saving money on expensive prescription cat food that he does n't need to be eating it holds about 30 pounds of cat food easily and has a samll footprint of floor space i ca n't say enough good things about this try it for yourself and discover how great it is
for the price this bread box ca n't be beat it 's larger and roomer than we thought it would be just right for bread buns and an extra bagels muffins cookies looks neat and nice on the counter well ventilated too
these were exactly what i was looking for the are tin and sturdy i also cook eggs in them to make them round for the biscuits ! thanks !
these woven cotton blankets are yummy ! ! ! i want more ! ! ! elegant soft gorgeous and my new favorite blanket on our bed ! ! ! we are blanket officionatos now because we have lots and i 've recently purchased even more different kinds of blankets i reviewed some of them as well woven cotton blankets just look more expensive and decorative then other kinds of blankets we rotate 5 different blankets on our king size bed to cover our down comforter and not only mix and match with the decor but to protect from the dirt or hair that we or our animals would deposit while lounging this cotton woven blanket would look good thrown over a couch or chair i always get the most compliments on the looks of my cotton woven blankets however my woolrich down throws are the most popular on our couches for warmth this sage color is luscious i recently purchased 2 different brands of sage and it 's interesting how differently it can be interpreted this one was more of a light apple color or peridot green ohhh soooo very pretty the woven pattern is elegant on our bed and it makes the leaves pop from the sheets and the comforter which is folded at the bottom i love that it 's lightweight yet heavy enough and is a high quality blanket i usually buy blankets we have need for many at discount places but i found this to be well worth the great price offered here it was free shipping too one of my better purchases here through amazon my husband really likes it and he is a bit of a snob about blankets every time i walk in the room i give a happy sigh i hope this helps with your blanket purchases
i am a salad man i like to cut ingrediants ahead of time and store salad knife eliminates rust lettuce
these knives are very easy to hold in your hand because of the rubber handles they clean very easily and they are extremely sharp they cut very well with very little effort
who me cooking yes i thought it was about time i owned some knives that actually cut through all the way without pounding i love the knives a lot actually they look great cut well and now when i watch rachael ray i can keep up
i finally ordered this set after looking at it for months it is fantastic i use them every day the handles are an added bonus they do not slip even if your hands are wet i am going to order the 7 '' knife also if you ca n't make up your mind buy it ! ! !
i am enjoying these knives i have wondered if i should not have gotten a bigger chef 's knife they do feel good in my hand even my almost 10 year old daughter wants to chop carrots with them ! actually using good knives makes the food preparation and cooking just a little bit more exciting now if only the sharpener would be delivered
ca n't beat the quality everything you will ever need to make the meals in the kitchen
this knife set showed up under the tree this year and i am glad it did the set is practical incorporating the 3 most used knives in the kitchen the paring knife is slightly larger than average and makes quick work of small vegetables and fruits the utility knife is versatile extremely effecient and saws neatly through just about anything the knife is a smaller rendition of a classic chef 's knife with very good balance and smooth precise cutting it sliced through 75 frozen chicken like it was a warm knife through butter the handles are extremely comfortable albeit a bit gaudy with the blaze orange coloring the case is functional with handle grooves and silicone covered magnets to hold the blades in place you could easily spend this on a quality chef 's knife alone but this set includes just that and 2 bonus knives making it a very nice bargain
recently my wife got rid of all the dishes due to health concerns we got this pan especially for cooking eggs etc although a little heavy it is a excellent product and we are very happy with this i did not give it 5 stars since i believe the handle could be a couple of inches longer and have something like a wooden cover '' to avoid overheating and make it convenient to manage overall i have no hesitation in recommending this you will not regret the buy !
i just received it this morning it looks really black and shiny so beautiful ! after washing it with hot water only patting it dry thoroughly oiling it all over with vegetable oil i gave it a first try by frying an egg it works better than my teflon skillet ! ! nothing stick on it ! ! ! excellent skillet ! !
this skillet is everything it is supposed to be iron it performs great
is not fully seasoned out of the box but within a short time will be a high heat saute pan lighter in construction than other lodge pans it handles well the casting ridges are not ground down but you will be using a potholder great tool period
this is such a great pan for omlets because of the sloped sides that allow you to slide underneath this would be a great first peice of cast iron for someone new to using it because of the size and it is i use it all the time it just keeps getting better
item was in a box in perfect condition and delivered in 2 days
it is adorable we had a large picture just like this when i was a child so this is a special reminder of it the minidisk pitcher is just the right size for an individual syrup pitcher for pancakes i would love to have one in every color
i absolutely adore fiestaware and this color is wonderful it 's a brick redish tone however when i ordered it i did n't realize just how small it would be i was imagining a creamer size pitcher and this is almost an individual size '' creamer similar to a size you 'd get at a restaurant for your coffee that having been said the quality is wonderful and it 's fiesta so it 's still worth 4 stars a super piece to add to a fiesta table
this is the perfect little pitcher to own for serving creamer or milk for coffee or tea it 's a wonderful compliment to the rest of the fiestaware line of serving items not only for everyday use but also for parties however i do recommend that you order more than one if you do plan on using them for many people mix and match the colors for a beautiful table setting
i have two of these and use them for sauces or dressings that pour easily thick or chunky items do n't always pour so well but cream herbed olive oil au jus etc work well these are good for meals where a sauceboat is too big or where you 'd like to have more sauce containers readily available to your guests rather than waiting for the gravy boat to get passed around and around so often
i have this grill and use it times a week to grill chicken or sandwiches works great just warm it up for 5 minutes pop on a sandwich or chicken a few minutes later dinner 's ready then after it cools you can pop out the grids for easy cleaning
this was an excellent purchase the grids are removable and go right in the dishwasher without any impact to the coating it has an audible timer which also shuts off the grill making it a great purchase for the elderly who might not hear the timer this is the second time we 've purchased the grill we gave the first grill to our son after we 'd used it for a couple of years it was still like new and we 'd used it a lot we called around our local area looking for another hb grill and could n't find one so we purchased a george foreman the features we were looking for especially the timer that shut the grill off were only available on the larger grills we 're cooking for two and really did n't want the family size '' grill so we left it in the box and pursued the hb until we found one on amazon we 're now happy grillers again and hope they never stop making the hb with the features we love
my mom has owned this grill for about a year and a half and she and i ocassionally use it whenever we cook something on it i find it to cook very effeciently and at a reasonable amount of time it comes with a timer so you can cook your food at the time you feel that is needed i cook a lot of food on this grill here hot dogs fish beef patties it also has a slot at the right side of the grill for the grease to run off of into a cup i seem to notice some of the 2 star reviews mainly one of the spotlight reviewers complain about how small the grill is i personally do n't believe it is that small unless you have two jumbo burgers or something to the equivulent on your grill then you are n't much room i cooked 5 on mine without any problem also my grill 's non stick surface has n't peeled off yet also i do n't have a problem with the amount of time it takes my food to cook because of the fact that the heat can not be adjusted seriously people whats a couple of extra minutes going to do when cooking your food are you that hungry enough that you have to compain about the grill taking longer to cook food i personaly believe that the surfaces keep a reasonable amount of heat so you can cook your food without burning youself you do n't have to spray oil or put butter on the grill because of it 's excellent surface another thing about this grill is that the surfaces comes apart so you can wash them or put them in the dishwasher i find that to be very convient when cleaning the grill this grill is very effective when cooking i find it very useful when i 'm trying to cook large amounts of food when i do n't have enough room on the stove this grill has made cooking very convient and much easier if you want to compare this to the competition the george forman grill one that we once had as well i find this one to have many advantages the only difference that i found is that hamilton beach grill has a timer and the plates can be taken off while the george forman grill can adjust the temperature in response to one reviewer you might want to thaw or defrost your food before you decide to cook it that might explain why it took so to cook your beef patty this grill was n't specifically made to cook frozen food in response to another reviewer i 've used this grill for quite a while and did n't have any weird plastic smells while using it
i bought this grill for my daughter in new york i bought one a year ago and love to use it not only does it cook your food faster than other methods it retains most of the juices that are cooked out of some foods by frying or baking clean up is a snap too ! one button releases the plates and into the dishwasher they go ! i would recommend this product very highly to people who enjoy great food !
just used this once but what a difference between this and my old george forman grill my old grill was such a pain to clean that i rarely used it this grill is a breeze just put the dirty parts in the dish washer as for the grilling it is on a par with my george forman which was excellent at cooking i 'm very happy
the grill works as good as its predecessor but is smaller helpful for limited space the removeable grids are great but the slant to let grease drain out the side is too steep can not use for pancakes because the batter slides off and eggs are definetly out of the question also the grease container come off very easily
i use this little grill almost on a daily basis i use it to grill up sandwiches or garlic toast even chicken for dinner or grill up a breast to mix up with some pasta for a quick meal it 's so convenient the grills are very easy to keep clean and it looks great on my counter i could n't have picked a better product
i want to speak up on behalf of hamilton beach indoor grills i just ordered this 25295 model which is my third in about a years it probably will last a few years making that three in ten years that 's not bad at all what went wrong with the one before this the previous model 25285 with removable grids is that the mechanism stopped being dependable i noticed that my steak got overcooked but thought it had been my fault for leaving it on too long it was n't until the next morning that i saw that the grill never shut itself off eeek stayed on overnight so it 's time for replacement after four years or so of constant use and perhaps some casual abuse the model before that replaced with the 25285 for cleaning ease and because i wanted white was given to my mother who also got a few years of faithful service so that one too lasted about four years i also gave one away as a present and its recipient who had been suspicious of such contraptions and has a tiny kitchen loved it and used it for years therefore this is the fourth hb indoor grill that i 've purchased if you are single and do n't have a lot of counter space this is tough to beat particularly for less than 50 and no tax or shipping charges and an easy return policy in addition to the warranty before i bought the 25295 i checked out the george foreman grills including the next generation '' cuisinart etc some of the others have some nice features that this model lacks such as temperature control greater grilling area floating hinge but to me that was offset by how much bulkier they are oftentimes quite ugly imho and not that much more bang for the buck i really do n't like it that some of the smaller gf models turn on only by being plugged in the wall maybe this is intended as a safety feature but i would n't want to constantly have to mess with that a power button should be essential rather than considered a nicety for which they charge extra this does a nice job with grilled sandwiches meat and fish sliced vegetables etc you get grill marks and it cooks everything right after you learn the appropriate times for different types of food it 's cooked bacon fine imho it does quite nicely with frozen meat or veggie patties and chicken breasts i particularly like to throw on a fairly thick frozen sirloin or salmon or tuna steak the outside gets browned while the interior stays moist and lightly cooked if you catch it in time the reservoir cup holds a lot so if you marinate the meat or fish and it drips it 's not a problem if it 's not essential to dispose of the fat that drips off and collects in the reservoir the ostensible purpose of indoor grills and still their prime marketing claim you can find ways to use it to baste the food during cooking buy a second cup or find something else to use or use it as the basis of gravy some reviewers have noted that the nonstick surface on the gf models flakes or chips off over time these hbs hold up but you do need to follow instructions wipe the grids clean while still warm and wash in the sink or dishwasher do n't use cleaning products or tools that will strip off the nonstick covering and use spray oil before grilling also let the grill heat up 5 min before use as per the directions food placed on hot surfaces sticks less than food that heats up with the surface of course such caramelization also enhances taste to some extent so you may want to fiddle with this for your purposes carefully scraping off the caramelized parts to avoid scratching the surface if the grids get messed up they can be replaced as long as the parts are manufactured which probably will be for a while the models i 've purchased have made a tidy footprint '' on my countertop and i know how to make it do what i need it to do it was n't worth it to spend maybe even twice as much for a few more bells and whistles when i would be settling for a style that i dislike and losing half the counter space yes it can be put away after use but i like to have kitchen gizmos within easy reach particularly if i like the way they look the grill gets too much use to be constantly tucked away anyway and this model matches my other stuff if i had chrome appliances or did more entertaining or a larger counter area i would 've been seriously tempted by the cusinart model though i have to admit therefore i think some of the negative comments need to be taken in the context of maybe judging too quickly or nitpicking needing a larger size grill for a family preferring more features using it incorrectly etc neither i nor the people i know who have had hb indoor grills have had problems with melting plastic or plastic odors hb makes the honda '' of indoor grills it 's dependable rather than flashy not big which matters for those with small kitchens rates well with consumers and through independent tests lasts for years and is n't more than a or person household needs why pay and pay for the electricity over time for what you do n't need if your needs are modest a modest indoor grill may well suit your purposes i look forward to the new grill living up to the quality of its predecessors in my household
very easy to use and easy to clean especially if i remember to spray the grill as recommended before preheating i usually just soaked the grills briefly in hot soapy water and they cleaned easily they will go in the dishwasher but i prefer to do them by hand since it 's so simple i found that i do need to clean the edges of the cut out '' oval where the grease runs into the drip pan which i was not expecting but still easy enough the hamburgers turkey burgers and chicken breasts were cooked quickly and were very good even though not the same as on an outdoor grill for turkey burgers chicken a sprinkle of paprika improves the color of the finished dish i also plan to cook a few extra burgers next time for a quick reheat in the microwave with no clean up
if you ask me this appliance was designed and engineered with a little more thought that other similar retail products comparable electric grills in the same price range really do n't offer the same options and features as the hamilton beach 25295 express indoor contact grill while the higher end george foreman grills feature a similar size cooking surface and a digital timer the hamilton beach 's analogue timer works just as well personally i ca n't imagine that digital over analogue in this instance could be of any importance this grill is best used for grilling chicken breasts meat paddies and boneless cuts of meat new users should be advised that electric indoor grill do not produce the same sort of flavor in meat that you will get using an outdoor grill using charcoal wood chips the best way to make use of an appliance like this is to marinate most foods for at least an hour before grilling which brings me to one advantage of the foreman grill in the past a vhs tape was among the accessories included with the gf grill it was a thirty minute class on what to do with the grill and how to prepare recipes with the hamilton beach grill you get a little pamphlet that has some recipes and descriptions of what sort of results to expect it 's too bad that there is n't more but that 's really the only downside maybe the grill does n't get as hot as the foreman grill but so what if it cooks a chicken breast in seven minutes instead of five i thought the grill broke down easily for cleaning unlike some of the other reviewers i did n't notice any weird plastic smells when i was cooking but then maybe i did n't scrutinize this appliance as carefully i 'm not very good at picking out of pepper either
i did a lot of research for pasta makers both automatic and manual i decided to try the lello 2200. the first pasta spaghetti i made came out perfect and tasted delicious it only took an hour from start to finish if you are considering an automatic pasta maker look no further ! this machine is so easy to use just follow the directions which are very complete and easy to understand making pasta has become fun using this machine i ca n't wait to try the cookies and soft pretzels
i did a great deal of research on the internet before buying an automatic pasta maker i could n't spend a fortune but i wanted the best quality machine i could afford i read too many reports of broken plastic extrusion discs motors that burned out etc i learned that the simac delonghi and lello products were all related so the quality of the older simac brand seemed to be carried on in the newer delonghi and lello brands i liked their metal extrusion discs and the durability of them i felt a 2 lb capacity was ideal i bought this one i was not disappointed i had read a great deal on the internet that the trickiest part is getting the dough consistency right most if not all of the negative reviews of all pasta machines center around this problem when trying to decide which machine to buy i do not recommend being influenced by reviews that focus entirely on this issue that complaint is all about user error and has nothing to do with the quality or reliability of the machine experienced makers of home made pasta need to understand that the dough will need to be a different consistency in this machine than when done the manual way i measured carefully and read the machine instructions very carefully they bend over backwards to help you with this and i did n't have any trouble getting pasta dough to extrude i found that a capacity is more than i needed for a family of 3. i also felt that having metal extrusion discs is valuable in that when you trim the dough as it extrudes you really run your knife against that metal a lot in order to help get a clean cut i can imagine a plastic disc would wear considerably faster under those circumstances you literally slice and slice hundreds of times for the smaller pastas like elbows and such i would highly recommend this machine i was impressed by its quality and usefulness you will not regret your purchase with this one
love it ! simple easy makes great pasta fun ! no problems with it sturdy and heavy duty highly recommend it
pruduct arrived in a timely manner well packaged and as advertised
after purchasing a set of spiegelau 's bordeaux wine glasses several months ago and being very impressed with their quality and price i decided to order a set of their rocks glasses once again the product delivered to my door is of exceptional quality and very nicely priced the look is elegant and simple the glass is well weighted with a thick base tapering nicely to a thin rim my only problem with these glasses is that they make me want to add another set of spieglau 's many styles to my kitchen and i 'm running out of space i wo n't be able to resist temptation very long and i think i 'll be ordering the highball glasses next
having become enamored of these fine elegant but durable glasses at the bar at sea ranch ca i am delighted to find i can buy a set of my own so affordably i look forward to sipping less bourbon from them
i replaced my old oven thermometer since the small print had become difficult to read glasses this one is very easy to read and shows the same accuracy as my old one as with other miu products i 'm very pleased with the high quality and the low cost
this is the best flatware i have ever purchased it is heavy and large there is a distinct difference in size between salad and regular folks and the soup spoons are outsized it is hard to tell from the pictures i have had 120 sets of oneida and the wallace has them beat we have very hard water and after a month of diswashering their luster has not dulled i would recommend these to anyone although amazon 's original '' price of 210 is a tad inflated even macy 's regular price is 110
gave as a gift and she really liked it so far so good
this spice rack saves space in my kitchen cabinet and makes finding spices while i 'm cooking so much easier i have had no problems with the quality of the materials or breakage and i use it daily i plan on buying another
an outstanding piece of kitchen cookware it looks and performs exactly like all clad for about the price it cooks exceptionally well at much lower temperatures than you are accustom to because of the aluminum there is very uniform heat throughout the pot including the sides the handles can get hot because they are close to the body of the pot while boiling with a gas stove but otherwise are pad cool do n't believe the reviews about hard to clean food sticks etc it is in my opinion these reviewers do n't know how to use the cookware properly if you are use a small shot of pam i have tried al types of oils but this works best and make sure that the temperature 25 less than normal also bar keepers friend as recommended in the users manual is perfect for making the inner and outer surfaces shine it is this pot is the perfect size for soups large quantities of sauces and roasts it is more manageable than the 8 q one that comes with the cuisinart multiclad pro set i use it more often than the larger pot fantastic product and great value i bought it for price on amazon in december 2006
i burnt my last stockpot an inexpensive revereware and needed a replacement i seriously thought about buying a new full set they 're always just a tad more than a single piece i 'm glad i did n't this stockpot is just the right size and does n't come in any prepackaged group what i really like is the even heating and the stainless steel weight it 's probably my imagination but i swear food cooked in it tastes better than before
i paid only a small amount of money for this heater and it works fine the thermostat is a little off but i can mle adjustments
i bought one of these last year and am using it again this winter this heater is rather quiet for a although powerful at the thermostat is n't very accurate but then it was only designed to keep a personal space at a certain temperature which it does well you would need two of these to keep a small apartment near a specific temperature otherwise set this heater to 5 deg above desired temp the heater it replaced was a radiant heater which failed just weeks after purchase eventually i decided the heater could not completely replace the kind of direct warmth i get from radiant units so now depending on my activity i alternate between the holmes and a newer heater made honeywell heaters usually annoy me but this one does n't and it turned out better than i thought it would i think this one would have rated 5 stars if it had a thermostat instead of digital presets
i inherited this heater and admit that i wanted it for sentimental value but i love it now ! having the ability to target a particular temperature is great i would n't want a heater without that feature what i would like is the ability to point the airstream up or down in addition to swiveling on the base it is wonderfully light and compact and feels very safe though looks are n't important to me this little unit is more attractive than many others i 've seen
though not a large heater it heats up a room as good or better than the space heater i use more than twice as big the one touch button operation takes a little time to get used to but all in all i consider this to be an excellent little heater
what a gorgeous set ! ! ! you wo n't regret buying this it is better that the 2 pieces seperate that way you wo n't have to bring the whole plate over to refill dip or coctail sauce the plate is so thick and shaped beautifully very artistic line
i purchased this item online in september of 2003 and while i have only used it once for entertaining i use the bowl all the time for almost anything since it 's made of glass it can match any table setting and the glass is very sturdy
i bought this in a pinch for entertaining and have really fell in love i had been searching for a chip and dip set that did not have the bowl attatched and was unable to find one until now the bowl is generously sized and the platter holds enough for at least 5 people to snack heavily another thing is that the glass is thick and fits nicely in the dishwasher i also like that it is simple it is able to go with any decor
my order arrived in a timely fashion as promised however when i opened the carefully packed box the glass funnel in my for later decanter set ' was broke a quick email to the wine enthusiast 's customer service rep cheryl nadler and two days later a complete replacement for later decanter set ' was delivered to my door step now i have no excuse not to open two bottles of wine later ' ! ! great products and excellent customer service
i have been using my wine for later set for over a year and recommend it highly i can open a bottle drink one glass and the wine i transfer to the carafes keep indefinitely ! it works much better than the vacuum stoppers i previously used
i ordered these after finally giving in and buying my dream espresso machine and i am just in as in love with these cups as i am with the machine itself ! not only are they durable and functional but they are classy and cute ! they are a lot of fun and i enjoy using them every day
these are wonderful cups just the right size and hold in the warmth very well all this and a uplifting set of graphic designs everyone who gets served espresso at our house compliments us on the cups functional and beautiful ! go for it
i gave these to my son and girlfriend for christmas they just loved these and she wants a whole set of dishes in this pattern
i ordered these as a gift and love them there are 6 different patterns and you can use them as a set or mix and match they are sturdy and seem very durable
cooks soft boiled eggs perfectly every time i use it daily and have put one at son 's home for when i visit
riedel makes the finest wine glasses in the world i ca n't quite step up to pay for the sommelier series but the vinum does n't disappoint the glasses have a nice weight and they look fantastic
i must admit that i do n't know much about wine and i never thought the glass could make the difference wine is wine no matter what you drink it from or so i thought but boy was i wrong ! i borrowed a couple of different glasses from my local store just to see if it was really worth it to have separate glasses for the different grape varieties and the answer is yes ! yes ! yes ! i tried the same wine in different glasses at home seevral ordinary glasses even mugs and then in the wrong and finally in the right riedel it was an average priced wine but when enjoyed from a riedel glass it became an almost heavenly experience i sat the whole evening enjoying the colour inhaling the bouquet looking at the wine flowing in my glass after 6 hours i still was n't even halfway through a bottle it was really something extraordinary normally i finish a bottle in a matter of 3 hours or so but this was too good to be gulped and forgotten the guys at riedel got this one right that 's for sure the cleaning however takes a certain skill it 's a very delicate affair especially since this glass has a wide belly and a rather narrow opening for hands making it very difficult to reach inside with a linen cloth for drying
i am a firm believer in the use of this stemware for burgundies and pinots of distinction but beware this glass will make lesser wines unravel at the seams as an example i recently discovered a 15 oregon pinot that i found quite pleasant after sampling this wine from wine glasses at a friend 's house i found this wine quite nice and decided to buy several bottles however after trying it in the burgundy glass which has a wider bowl which allows more aromas to escape as well as a more narrow lip that traps and concentrates the bouquet the wine smelled alcoholic acidic and medicinal the moral of the story use this for your premier cru and grand gru burgundies and other pinots which have infinite layers of aroma and complexity to discover avoid the lesser burgundies and pinots out of this glass and try them in something that is more forgiving
ok i 'm wary of everyone that will read this and like me in the past think anyone who believes the glass wine is consumed from can have a bearing on it 's taste and enjoyment but it does ! try them you 'll see i especially love the thin almost flexible nature of the rim of each glass cheers
good glasses great for barolo and barbaresco in addition to burgundies my only complaint is that the stem is that these glasses are a little short
i 've been using this glass for years now i agree it 's one of the best all around for enjoying a myriad of wine types
not only do these wine glasses vastly improve the aroma and taste of burgundy my favorite and pinot noir they make all red wines smell and taste better including bordeaux and cabs and most italian and spanish wines i 've used them for my everyday cab is much improved in these wine glasses it tastes like a much more expensive wine
not quit what was in the picture but still pleased with the purchase
i have used other kitty litter mats but this is the first on that eliminates that dreaded kitty litter spread
eesy to use clean by vacuum cleaner less trush in the bathroom i have no regrets about this purchase
the reason i bought this mat was for exactly that ! helping to keep litter from the general area of the litter pan i think it must be far more comfortable for my cats then standing on scattered litter however you know felines ! one of my cats is afraid to step on it but steps over it it is comfortable on their pads i actually use one outside my apartment door with a bed for strays on top it 's just the right size and the bed never gets wet or dirty this way glad i got two
i have had many different paw mats in the past and found this one to work the best for one it is not ment for human feet it and is not ment to feel good either on your feet since it is plastic it is there to help reduce cat litter from getting all over the floor i have also found that if you place the mat about two maybe three inches from the cat box that my cats will use it when they are done and not try to leap over it like some views have mentioned it does also help when you are cleaning the cat box to clean out the mat of litter to otherwise it will not work effectively just a couple shakes in the garbage bag will do the trick i have had mine now for a couple of years now and it is the only mat that i find that works best for my two cats
unfortunately this pan is no longer sold as an open stock item and can only be found in sets such as the and piece sets fortunately i was able to buy it from a marketplace seller for a very agreeable amount of 50 however i do see that amazon is selling it for 150 which is vastly inflated but takes into account the fact that it ca n't be obtained without buying the 13 piece 399 set this pan is just the right size for sauteeing stir frying you name it it 's not huge like it 's big brother the 5 qt saute pan but is suited to most normal cooking the walls are deep enough to contain many dishes which is nice it 's a bit heavy to hold better for those muscles ! and i appreciate the addition of a small handle on the other side of most importance is its lid for some reason which calphalon does not sell separately it can fit snugly over this pan the wok the 10 '' omelette pan and the 8 qt stockpot hey it even fits some of my old pots as well thus increasing the worth of this item really a terrific addition to any kitchen a note about after extended use there will be tarnishing and brown blemishes at least on my gas range to get rid of these do not use bon ami because it 's too gentle and does n't get rid of stains best way to go is barkeeper 's friend about 2.50 at your local supermarket or cameo stainless steel cleaner however cameo is more abrasive than barkeeper 's friend and will reduce the mirror polish of these pans barkeeper 's is the way to remember to always rub in a circular back and forth will scratch the surfaces
i use this heater to heat our sun porch turing the spring and fall as well as take the chill out of the basement for my morning workouts during the winter it does a great job although it is kinda small if you need to warm up a area i 'd say up to 16 x 16 this is a wonderful reasonably priced unit
it 's quick to heat up and heat is intense perfect for small however the temperature control does n't work very well so it can get very hot and dry
i bought this heater for my office which being in an old building tends to have a hard time staying warm in winter i 've got a few honeywell air purifiers at home working so i stuck with this manufacturer for this purchase i 'm glad i did pros it heats my office quickly and maintains the desired temperature controls are easy to use it 's small and easily placed out of the way cons the fan is a little noisy wish it came in black like most of the other appliances and items in my office i 'd recommend this little space heater for anyone with similiar needs
the heater is much smaller than what i expected but it really heat the room efficiently and it has a good price which is easy to see however it causes a little bit noise and electricity unstable while working
when i first plugged it in it had a problem and shut down something with it 's saftey system i 'm sure after unplugging it and a five minute wait it worked perfectly and seems to be fine
the heater is quite good my only complaint is that there is no real temperature control it has an control whenever it is on it blasts the full heat the on period can be controlled probably also the fan speed nothing else however for its price it is a good piece
i have never had an electric heater before so i was n't sure what to expect especially when i heard so many horror stories about electric heaters starting home fires however i wanted a small heater to use on my legs and feet when i am sitting at my computer being that the heater is a honeywell i figued i could n't gone wrong with it and i bought it on sale so the price was cheap i can not raved highly enough about this heater it is so small and yet it heats up my whole bedroom which i was not expecting i can pick it up and take it to any room or place where i need it it truely is the mouse that roared when i read others who reviewed this heater their biggest complaint was that there is no off and on switch this is true but i would n't want to leave it plugged in when i am not using it anyway just to be on the safe side buy it you wo n't regret it
the size of this tray is not 7 x 4 x 1. it is larger than this i think amazon should revise this with correct sizes many times products details are not accurate i hope amazon could improve on this a little better
the tray is beautiful i bought it for a christmas present anyone who is collecting this pattern should be pleased additionally i have looked at many sites to get the best price on the pattern and amazon was the cheapest
i already had two like this and 4 cd racks of the same style but the store where i got them was n't selling any more this one is the exact same brand so it matches perfectly you can hang it vertically or horizontally which holds more discs
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat due to this efficiency it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide rust does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds 2 quarts of food measures 7 x 11 inches internally and weighs 6 pounds 2 quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need this may be the pan for families from except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset 7 x 9 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 6 pounds
the product looks great takes up very little space it is easy to clean and works like a charm
i read all reviews on the remanufactured gr 4 griddler by cuisinart yes mine had a few cosmetic blemishes that is to be expected nothing major though i wont complain i paid 70.00 off the original price i have used the griller to make flat bread pancakes steaks chicken sandwiches and veggies i could not be happier its easy to clean and heats up in a instant my only complaint is when using the griddle both sides heat up and you do n't have the option to only use one side i love cuisinart and they never fail to impress me with the workmanship
i bought this remanufactured grill last month and it arrived in condition i have used it a number of times and am very pleased with it so far i have been hand washing the grill plates after reading about them peeling after a year i am being very careful with them this is definitely easier to clean than the deni i had before
i could n't be more pleased with this remanufactured product it exceeds my expectations for both quality and ease of use any negative reviews have to be biased by some very isolated situation we have used both the griddle and the it makes absolutely wonderful burgers chicken sausages and sandwiches the ease it is nothing short of amazing this was a real bargain and i advise anyone who is thinking about it to grab it
i had a george foreman unit but the coating wore off very quickly this unit is great and much more versatile what sold me were the removable grill plates
the griddler arrived in a timely manner and in excellent shape my family uses it times a week and we all think it has been one of our best purchases
this rebuilt grill works well comes with 2 pairs of grilling plates that are easy to switch clean this is a large unit so it is more difficult to store
i ca n't say enough about this little machine it makes cooking fun again and all the food taste like your dining out i have made so many different sandwiches using flat breads tortias loaf bread etc all taste great i have grilled steaks chops shrimp chicken and veggies the griddle makes a nice amount of pancakes at the same time the heat up time is very fast and clean up is even faster if for some reason my griddler were to wear out i would absolutly buy another i would recommend you try it
received this item a couple of weeks ago it 's hysterically funny although my does n't think so the knives are nice quality and you just ca n't beat the feeling of satisfaction when you shove one back in it 's place ! bigger than i thought it was going to be but i 'm with who has seen it goes nuts for mne this was a great buy
this is a wonderful piece of modern design iconic and hilarious the holder is made of hard plastic i wish it were made of something like shiny vinyl on the outside though i think it 'd be more protected against falls if it were the knives in my opinion are n't as great as the other reviewers are saying mine have already started to get rust stains in some places so the stainless '' in stainless steel is n't quite up to snuff they keep their edge as well as an average supermarket knife would i have n't taken mine to a knife sharpener yet to see how well they 'll take a refinishing however the point of this thing is the holder and that is completely worth it it always grabs attention in the kitchen even the construction guys working on our renovation laughed if you 're looking for a serious voodoo toy this is n't it the knives do not go in an out of the sheath holes so easily that you 'd actually want to play with it
this was a great product at a great price it is definitely a conversation starter for guests the knives are excellent quality too this purchase was a steal
i bought this for a current partners xmas pressie after he found out recently during our relationship all that his ex wife had got up to during theirs i 'm not sure how much something like this really helps to get over a painful relationship but at the end of the day if you can get a laugh at their expense then it 's worth it 's weight and it sure makes a great conversation piece great quality knives too however we have decided to keep ours more of an object d'art as you do have to be careful when replacing the knives in their slots that their ends dont scratch the holder great price too 60 here compared to over 150 locally where i initially considered buying it
i first saw this in a magazine at the hair salon i go to and it brought a smile to my face hilarious i think people will get a kick out of this this was gift to my daughter who loved it and said the knives are well made the holder is a good size great conversation piece
not only is this piece cool lookin but the knives it comes with are excellen
this is by far the coolest gift i have ever purchased the recipient has n't stopped talking about it yet she says somedays it 's the ex '' and somedays it 's the boss '' i asked her if the knives were any good and she said who cares ! ! '' it is such a conversation piece and has provided endless joy ! btw the knives are just fine
these are on sale at my local store for 160.00 the price offered here is fantastic they come in several colors the chrome being a bit more expensive because it looks finer than the plastic red black white and even apple green all but the chrome look are very plastic and look plastic up close but dont be disappointed with that because they still look awesome the red has the advantage of being blood colored i recommend these im a picky buyer too great gift i 'm glad i didnt buy a set at my local store
the best surprise is the evenly toasted crunchy surface of the toast with just the right amount of moisture left in the center of the bread i also am very pleased with the design it looks like a little proofing box for rising dough very unique
this is our third toaster oven we use ours daily they seem to have a useful life of around 10 years and then the elements start to flake out very compact and versatile given the size in a small kitchen they are a life saver highly recommend
i have purchased 6 sanyo space saving toaster ovens toasters for other people that made a point of saying they wished they had one i like the even toasting they abiity to make sandwiches and the ability to toast or heat food with a variety of thicknesses i own two toasters one in a vacation rental in fl and have had several people ask where they can i get that toaster '' i wish it came in more colors
at 950 watts and with a footprint of less than 1 sq ft this is especially suited for a studio apartment or for a kitchen with limited counter space and a limited number of electric circuits it 's also a true gem to put in a guestroom breakfast bar or a vacation cottage if you are lucky enough to have either one it works well for an elderly relative in assisted living contrary to what the technical specifications state this appliance does have an automatic feature the timer shuts off after 15 minutes as a toaster it 's relatively slow but it 's versatile it handles bagels better than a regular toaster warms up pastries nicely and you can toast on only one side on the down side toasting anything does take longer as another reviewer noted this may be because it has what appear to be light bars '' instead of metal heating coils or rods so no it 's not a equivalent of an oven or even a toaster oven the temperature control is set in the vicinity of 375 you ca n't broil but you can bake just a few cookies whether you use one of the refrigerated rolls of cookie dough or make your own batch of cookie dough you can freeze the or divide the whole batch into in portions then bake cookies while you prepare dinner what an aroma to have them fresh ! and no temptation later you can also let the take out a portion and bake them a bonus is that the toasty also makes superb english muffin pizza no soggy bottoms like in the microwave i also like it for melting cheese on toast it also reheats a single slice of pizza very nicely about replacement pans and clean up you can buy one of the thinner style silicone baking liners be sure it 's 100 silicone with no fillers for a small pan and cut it to size for each of the pans clean up is very easy then and since the liners are reusable it 's cheaper in the long run than lining the pans with aluminum foil if you are or have a handy person around you can also custom trim a couple of unglazed baking tiles to make your own little pizza oven summary downside is that it 's slower than a toaster more limited than a oven and a tad pricey but it 's small and it 's cute ! note to find a silicone mat without fillers just bend it if it turns white the mat contains fillers and it should not be cut
i bought this for the feature which is terrific and it looks good i expected a toaster oven but it is really only a toaster it could use a little more power so that it would toast more quickly but eventually it gets the job done
this toaster is definitely a space saver there are a few things you need to know to get great food out of it though for toast i turn the oven on before i get the bread out so that it is at a good temp when i put the slices in if you want to bake something or toast a baguette sandwich just use the bottom burner i like how the shelves come out when you open the door it makes retrieving your food so much easier all in all it takes a few tries to adjust to this toaster oven but it makes up for the initial awkward period by being so cute and small i 'm very happy with my purchase
this toaster is great ! it 's a real space saver with big toaster power this seller is wonderful too packed with care and received quickly and safely ! to all
we 've had the super toasty for about one month very good for our needs toasts very well evenly and quickly perfect small size for our counter matches well with our black and chrome applicanes no temperature setting is the only drawback but we do n't miss that much
these days it 's hard finding a simple toaster oven most of them are huge have convection capability and complicated digital displays etc not the sanyo toasty i like it because it 's very compact tall rather than wide and looks good in my retro kitchen my husband on the other hand thinks it looks like something your dentist would use to sterilize drill bits but he 's getting used to the toasty 's offbeat design it toasts bread and bagels just fine yes there 's no heat setting and others have complained about that that drawback does n't bother me as long as you 're not looking to heat up large or long items the toasty is fine
works great simple to operate just what i needed for my contemporary kitchen small but efficient
this item is acually rated for 900 total pounds but it seems a little flimzy to me i already had one shelving unit that i bought from a local store that is much beefier but was not much more expensive i loaded this unit up with items in my garage and it is holding but i do n't fully trust it the side supports are a little too thin and it is just a bit wobbly i am going to anchor it to the wall but i really should n't have to do that also the edges are very sharp i would recommend wearing gloves while assembling the instruction sheet did warn of this but really many people actually read the instructions
i love it it was easy to assemble and very sturdy too i am looking forward to purchasing another one soon you will not be disappointed
it is ideal for storage it is not very attractive but very useful
the shelving i purchased was a big step in my being able to organize my garage the shelving was a snap '' to put together they were assembled in about 10 minutes no tools needed i would strongly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get organized
besides being heavy and bulky putting this together was n't too bad once you have the first shelf or two in place it 's all downhill from there it 's been a while but i do n't remember cutting myself this one is more stable and squared off than another one i bought with all metal shelves that kind of shelves can bend in the middle and i had a terrible time getting them square ! ! an added benefit is the fiberboard material i stained it dark blue and coated it with a few coats of polyurethane so it looks really nice and the shelves will last longer i 'm buying two more to expand
i just purchased a second unit i went together easily i did not have any problems with assembly and did not receive any cuts while assembling it bare handed
what a great product for dog food i wish they made one smaller for cat food definitely would buy one and you ca n't beat the price petsmart shipped really fast
i ordered two sets of the dinnerware and upon arrival about 4 bowls 2 salad plates and a dinner plates were cracked chipped etc however amazon made it extremely easy to get the whole boxed returned and replaced with a new set unfortunately the new set had one broken item in it but i figured one was a lot better than 8. the set itself is excellent they are versatile with any decorative theme and clean up great in the dishwasher
le creuset products really conduct the heat and are great products to have in the kitchen one drawback they can be difficult to clean if you sear meat or fry burnt remnants can not be removed overnight soaking will help but you can not use soft scrub or hard scrubbers on the enamel the product still functions well it just does not look as nice as an expensive piece of cooking gear should be ! would buy it again
this is one versatile pan i was pleasantly surprised with its size i can easily feed people everything i made came out delicious is pan is gorgeous this is my first le crueset and wo n't be my is pricey but it will last a long time
this is a large casserole but quite wide and great for somethings like paella but not good for anything very runny or requiring long slow cooking it is a great extra but does n't replace a big deep casserole which i had to buy additionally
this is a wonderful casserole ! it makes me happy just to look at this beautiful pot let alone cook with it ! i highly recommend le creuset to anyone who love 's to cook it 's a pot you 'll have for a lifetime
i ca n't beleive anyone would just use this for serving it 's a very useful size great for searing meats and then roasting in the oven rice dishes etc the pan is not heavy the lid is a killer but i think that helps in braising
i love this piece of le creuset it 's just beautiful and so easy to clean up
i do alot of 'experimental ' cooking and have found this dish consistently superior in it 's ability to deliver even heat and add to the cooking process it is the perfect size for a family of 3 or more who also want 'leftovers ' for lunch the following day it cleans up very easily and is always presentable enough to carry a favorite meal to a special event
this casserole accommodates everything from a whole roaster chicken ok a smaller one to duck confit to risotto i appreciate being able to use this pot on the range and in the oven great for osso bucco ! it 's nice for entertaining and for slow cooking highly recommended
this pan gets used more than any other cuisinart chef 's classic nonstick stainless pan in my kitchen i love the size and use it for a wide variety of food preparation the clean up is so easy
the mug alone costs 6.99 so the kit for 16.99 is a bargain i love the mug size its handle and vent lid i would prefer an on and off button for the warmer but it does keep my coffee warm i do n't know if i 'll ever use the lunch bag but it is well made
this set of shot glasses has this vintage look that i adore the different engraved design on each piece make these glasses look so unique just like little jewels that 'll make you want to display them somewhere plus when you are entertaining your guests will always know wich glass is theirs give it a shot and buy them
i got these for a friend for christmas they shipped quickly and are really neat shot glasses i kind of want to get some for myself
i love this glasses actually i bought the whole set of this style of glasses white wine red wine martini water and shot glasses they have very unique style
this pan has been excellent i have used it mostly for omelettes and frittatas one thing to note despite the current desription the pan does not come with a glass lid otherwise it cleans easily it appears to be made in toledo not china
well its working really good i think for compact refrigerator this is the best choice
i had been wanting a compact refrigerator for awhile now finally decided to get one and i must say this is a fine choice the first thing i noticed about it was it was a little bigger then i expected for some reason but it is relativly light and movable one thing i really like about it is the look the front is stainless steel with the 2 sides and top being a very nice looking glossy black inside the fridge is pretty roomy well as roomy as a can be anyways now on to the operation it gets really cold and i keep it at the setting of 3. it goes all the way up to 7. it 's got a nice little ice tray on the top which is a nice feature although the little freezer tray does seem to get some frost build up over time which i 'm not really a fan of also the fridge is not loud at all at first i noticed it being on just because i was n't used to having a compact fridge in my room but soon after i forgot it was even there all in all this fridge is a very nice product and the price is supurb for 100 i was expecting it to look and operate somewhat clunky but i was pleasently suprised at it 's good looks and quiet operation i recommend it
we have the refrigerator by our keep can drinks in works great we are very pleased
i bought this for my office i looks great and works fine it also was received very fast i was amazed how quickly i received it one issue though it has one of the most lacking owner 's manuals so be prepared for trial and error i know a fridge is not the most complicated equipment but i had to guess which way the cold adjustment knob was supposed to go to make the fridge colder the knob is also down in the back so if you have to adjust it is a bit of a reach now that i figured things out though i really am pleased
i happen to think that these saucers are the prettiest out of the entire i originally got a couple as a gift and loved them so much decided to expand and make it a collection i was hoping to find the teacups here too but had to purchase them elsewhere
these plates are nice and large they are also very white and clean looking a little on the heavy side though which makes them feel expensive i ordered these plates in october and received them in a timely manner i liked them and ordered a second set in november which i still have n't received amazon has sent emails saying they are coming but as of yet they are still not here
if you 're an all clad chef you know the quality accept no substitute for a splatter screen i was tired of wiping up grease splatters all over my stovetop around the dials on the floor etc the cheap flat screens just do n't stay on the pan the edges of the all clad screen make it foolproof for staying in place the handle design saves space in storage one size fits everything up to 13 inches the screen is a high quality design not a window screen that gets punctured sooner or later i can tell that this screen will never bend out of shape either yes it was more expensive than the cheap flat ones but you 'll appreciate the performance and durability advantages
i have been looking for one of these for years every where hardware supermarkets and even walmart does n't carry it call there porchasing agent and enlighten them that the item is availavle i am 75
i got 2 of these and they are great i use them as a night light emergency light and a tent light when i 'm camping it works great keeping critters away from you camp i put one in the tent as a light and put the other outside aimed at my cooler and food if you have ever been raided by a you can appreciate this it would be a great product at twice the price good company i highly recommend it
i liked the energy saving leds and motion sensor the only drawbacks are the size it is a large light covers the entire 2 socket outlet no matter if you plug it in the top or bottom socket also if you look at it straight on the light is very blinding since it uses a mirror to strengthen the led lights another inconvenient thing is that the photocell to sense daylight to turn off the motion sensor light when it is bright outside is a bit weak even when i can see clearly it turns on but the photocell does work when i turn on full overhead lights there is a dusk to dawn mode but i would prefer for it to not turn on during the day when using the motion sensing option other than that i love the energy savings
great product for places with no outlets the range is average so if you are going to use it to light a stairway like i did then you will need to get two one for the top of the stairs and one for the bottom
columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time i did n't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom the color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender they call it plumberry the weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it when the washcloths are completely drenched they do seem a little more heavy than most although they have that spa feel '' to them and they retain heat very well which makes them sort of comforting i 've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent i 've found they are made with 100 combed cotton and have a heavier feel the edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they do n't fall apart the first time you wash them rebecca review
i have recently become a fiestaware addict ! i started with these cute little bowls which i thought would be perfect for my three small children to use for my two year old it is the perfect size for cereal we also use these little fruit bowls to serve well fruit at the dinner table i also like using these bowls for quick candy or nuts dishes when guests arrive they really are so veratile they stack up nicely in the cupboard and the cinnabar color is unbelievably rich and pretty i just ordered several new pieces in other colors too and the cinnabar coordinates wonderfully with the plum cobalt and periwinkle
if anyone had suggested that i would spend that much money on a coffee maker iwould have laughed once you use this machine it is no longer necessary to spend money for coffee at any of the national chains it is quick convenient easy to operate and makes an excellent cup of coffee
i researched all of the top espresso machines including rancilio gaggia nespresso expobar and jura capresso most machines i eliminated because they had copper or brass boilers safer stainless steel i also wanted something easy to use and self cleaning the jura capresso makes perfect crema espresso with a push of a button and the manual doser works great for decaf i added the frothexpress attachment which siphons milk from my stainless steel milk container and makes instand microfoam froth perfectly according to the jura capresso rep i talked with this machine has similar interior workings to their much more expensive machines at a much lower cost the black plastic housing looks great on the counter and seems durable not worth the extra money for the and more metal i am very particular when it comes to the flavor of espresso and this machine makes espresso that rivals any that i have had at home or at a coffee store in terms of flavor and temperature this machine is one of the best home appliances i have ever purchased i do not work for jura capresso at 850 with no tax and free shipping through amazon it is a bargain
this machine made the best coffee i have had in the states the layer on top that is produced is reminiscent of the coffee i had in italy i would recommend this machine to any and everyone
the machine is superb ! it makes consistently great tasting coffee each and every time it sets up easily and turns on with a push of a button we have our coffee within minutes just by pushing a button and placing our cup under the spout we choose our selection of coffee strenght amount 1 oz 8 oz 1 2 cups and drink up it automatically shuts off and we determine when i have not been able to produce a thick foam with the frother and thought it would be more powerful but overall it 's a great addition to our kitchen
i bought this for my wife who drinks about six cups every morning finally got her to switch to mostly decaf i first bought a less expensive still 400 machine which was not automated took it back when i realized that it was probably share space on the counter with our current coffee maker as using it involved additional tasks and with three kids we already have enough tasks the works great easy to use easy to clean really only the steam wand and that is simple to clean as the espresso or coffee fills the cup and no extra work it tells you when to empty the grounds about every 10 cups and fill the water and beans it rinses the nozzle automatically when it shuts down two hour auto shut down and tells you to rinse it by pushing a button when you power it up i can not think of an easier way to have coffee espresso cappuccino or cafe au lait anytime we feel like it i especially like the fact that we are not tied into using a company 's pods paying a premium and wasting a lot of paper and can load any bean we desire or use the bypass to use ground coffee two wishes a larger water tank or ability to hook up to water supply and allowing the angle of the steam wand to move higher as it can be a pain to put the wand into larger mugs but those are just wishes not gripes two months and no problems just got the steamer container that came free but have n't tried it yet a great buy ! ! !
these are the same size as the siliconezone fluted tart pan which i paid twice as much for i thought these were minis and planned to bake cookies in them but they are big
i have used these for making florentine cookies which are extremely sticky having used disposable mini aluminum pans in the past they work perfectly releasing the florentines immediately just ordered two more pans and the price went down too
it 's fiesta ware what 's not to love ! could n't find this one anywhere else
this is a great idea ! everyone should have at least one of these personally i 'd get one for every member of the household the well is perfect so theres no slipping or sliding and it can easily be carried without having to worry about it falling off we love this and this is a great color so much prettier than the picture
one of the criteria in this family for what color to stock up on is how it looks under mexican food sea mist and rose are two of the best so we 're building up our stock before they are discontinued at the end of the year this set is a great way to prevent public just have a lot of these in the pantry so everyone can guilt free
finally a pan that makes it easy to bake ! no more messing up the first piece of cheesecake or brownies trying to get them out of the pan the sides of this pan just pop off and leave you with access to cut from all sides the finish cleans up in seconds it bakes evenly also i would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to bake
cooks nicely performs well great new shape very satisfied customer ! the cherry cheesecake recipe included is good too use recipes for round pans to make full use of the pa
my wife and i noticed the difference within a day of using it we felt better in the morning neither of us has been sick this winter after using it for several months and i was amazed at how much dust was on the when i replaced it for the first time i 'm so glad we bought it note as with all hepa filters it does make noise i recommend buying a large one and running it on low when you 're sleeping in the room
i keep this unit running throughout the day in my bedroom and shut it off at bedtime too noisy for me i 'm actually sleeping stuffy i recommend this filter for anyone who has some difficulty breathing easy at night
pro very good ratings from consumer reports con to read the reviews here it 's loud but it 's not what i imagined it 's loud '' setting is about as loud as a bathroom fan and it can easily be set to low '' at night to make it just what matters my wife did n't need her asthma inhaler after the first day so i 'm very happy with this
i bought this to replace an old honeywell heppa air purifier since we were use to the white noise of the old one we wanted one we could hear if you put this one on the lowest setting it 's just right noise and settings we find way too loud it cleans the air well i only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the light around the control is extremely bright i had to paint around it to black it out and it still shines through some
good unit helps my girlfriend who has allergies downside is that it has a bright blue light that lights the roon at night if it isnt covered with our socks and its loud on high on low the brain gets used to the noise though bad if you watch alot of tv next to it
i bought one of these to help my family 's allergies and my asthma it is great i can tell a huge difference even in the amount of dust i will say that the are a little noisy my sister has the same one and hers does n't seem to be as noisy but maybe it is just me it is is n't enough for me not to use it though i highly reccomend this product especially if you suffer from allergies the way i do you will notice a big difference within just a day or two i am even buying another to put in my bedroom
the air purifier works well the only problem is that it takes up a lot of space it provides great white noise for sleeping
i have purchased several honeywell air cleaners recently for my family children parents and brother 's household and have been very pleased with their performance and and engineering i was looking for an air cleaner for my daughter 's room and was given an older model by friends who had used it briefly before buying an ionic breeze instead due to the noise the only reason i did n't rate it 5 stars while that machine is a sears labelled appliance it is identical to a small honeywell it has effectively reduced her symptoms and the noise hasb n't been disagreeable on lower settings with any of the machines using the higher settings an hour or so before bedtime and reducing the fan speed to low during the night produces a 'white nboise '' that i find soothing replacement filters permanent arte readily availabvle and economical under 15.00 at amazon other honeywell air cleaners we have purchased differ in that they have no ionizer not recommended by medical i am myself a family physician and in their capacity all of the machines i have bought are the round ones and this is an imiportant design feature in that these models use either og two sizes of replacement permanent filters as above larger models may use up to three stacked filters in place of the original and expensive filter all use a which may be vacuumed periodically and used for substantially longer than the packaging indicated at least 6 months the hepa filters may be vacuumed as well a simple maintenance task the filter that comes with a filter that is not permanent but is instead a '' singlre filter with a recommended replacement interval of five years it does not have a permanent filter '' one of the big pluses for these machines is the excellent warranty no machine in this price range except a few hunter models offer a warranty and hunter permanent filters are far more expensive and find i have noted some complaints about warranty service in other reviews of honeywell products but nonetheless it is still a very good value i ofund some of my machines in the local goodwill for 10 or check it out ! on new machines i really could n't beat the amazon deals substantially and ordered one of these and another odel for family my brother was so impressed he went out and bought 2 other machines regrettably not honeywell for his fairly severe allergy problems t would n't count on these machines to eliminate strong odors vcompletely but they do make a difference i would add a final note about my experience with central air conditioner filters a nmerv of is sufficient to remove almost all common allergens higher filtration requires larger surface area to prevent excessive air obstruction we bought a filter some time ago that we could n't use for that very reason the most economical is the lysol brand filter available in lowes stores removing bacteria from the air is air sdanitizer '' are a waste of money airborne bacteria rarely survive long and do not cause odors in and of they must be in a nutrient rich medium and actively growing to cause odors as for mold remember that removing moisture is the answer to that problem a relative humidity of 40 or less will take care of mold and mildew very nicely so use your ac dehumidifier or pipe wrench as needed to control moisture problems as for vacuums they all if you use them ! a central system that exhausts to the outdoors or a garage area that can be aired is a great option bagless vacuums water trap vacuums etc really do n't make much difference in air quality we find that using simple bedlinens in the children 's rooms which can be tossed in the dryer for 10 minutes are useful ways to control dust mites and remove some of their allergens stuffed animal toys can also be given a spin for the same reasion sorry if i get carried away but i have always felt a duty to teach my opatients to take care of themselves i hope this has been helpful the honeywell air cleaners are a great way for allergy sufferers to take control of their symptoms in part
in an attempt to get red coffee mugs i ordered two cinnibar '' fiestaware coffee mugs while they are in the red family the color has too much brown in it for me i wish fiestaware would produce a true red shade other than that they were fine price reduction did n't mean much once the s h were added could have driven to the store paid regular price and still gotten them for less my fault for being lazy
if you 've bought fiestaware place settings in the past you 've surely noticed the awkward shape of the coffee mugs of yore the old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably while the art deco design is lovely using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting morning coffee '' experience we 've come to expect from diner mugs anyway fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle and it 's a realistic size too not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee yay for the java mug
definitely focuses the flavor and aroma of the finest hermitage shiraz etc but the the glasses do not feel as delicate and refined as my other sommelier series do maybe because they are hand made i compared the ones i bought on amazon to another set at a local store the glasses at the store felt lighter otherwise the glasses are excellent ! go figure oh and there was a small bubble on one of the glasses not a distraction after filled with wine but 60.00 a glass ! !
this product is great to store cereal in ! it keeps it food fresh and leaves very little mess when the children use it it is great i would recommend it to everyone
i was a bit hesitant to give this a try simply because i did n't see how spending 35 would be worth it when i could just have my cats ' dry food bags be rolled and clipped for freshness for a lot cheaper but i am so happy that i purchased this dual food dispenser first it is incredibly easy to put together and arrived in perfect shape it looks as though it might be unsturdy but so far it has held its ground the overall appearance is very attractive and looks a helluva lot better than rolled up bags ! in terms of its utility this dispenser is terrific ! i can keep almost a full bag of cat kibble in each dispenser so getting the kitties ready for meals is simple a few twists of the knob and i have just the right portion i also no longer have dry food pouring out of enlarged bag holes causing unpleasant crumbly messes when the pieces i missed when cleaning up are accidentally stepped on later overall this is a great product it 's plastic but looks very sleek and the chrome handle is a very nice touch that coordinates well with my decor zevro offers a similar dispenser that is specified as a pet food dispenser but i think they 're pretty much all the same thing i picked this one because i wanted the two different containers plus i liked the color scheme better and it has worked out quite well
we purchased the ceral dispenser especially for our guests to serve themselves one of two types of ceral we offer in the mornings it is a nice design and seems to work very well the seal seems good enough to insure freshness
i love this dispenser it helps keep all of the clutter of cereal boxes off of my refrigerator and out of my cabinets my 1 year old loves to turn the knob to get the cereal out
we love this blender i 've never had a blender with power before i guess but this one will take a beet or a carrot and chop it up just like it 's oatmeal or something it makes awesome shakes and i use it to chop or puree lots of everything else as well
i was so happy with my first l'equip that i bought another one to have at work ! it 's awesome ! i have the other blender but this one runs circles around it i use the other one to chop up food scraps for the compost pile
these were a perfect fit for my older ionic pro when i first got them they looked different but they still fit i got my product faster then i thought i would and that 's great service very pleased with everything
glade we bought them we do not smoke but are living in an apartment where our neighbors do smoke no longer is noticable in our apartment even going one day the machine you could smell smoke now we do n't have to wait for the blades to dry but use the extra set
i love these pieces i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai
despite the picture currently posted above and i 'll edit this should it ever change the 5 piece completer set contains a large round platter a serving or vegetable '' bowl covered sugar bowl creamer the platter looks exactly like the dinner plates but it is approximately 12 '' in diameter the serving bowl is a perfect for most family meals i used it more than any other serving bowl in my kitchen its shape is similar to the salad bowl although it seems to sweep out more proportionately from the base the sugar bowl has a top and the creamer has a high relatively narrow spout that does n't drip like the rest of the nova series the look is sedate and handcrafted although it is not with a hint of asian i love the way this line looks but those seeking out an elegant pattern would best look elsewhere
i am still trying to figure out how this fan and the other honeywell fan differ other than this is 24.99 and the other is 39.99 mine has the exact features as the more expensive one even though this is described as a bargin unit this has the individual fan controls directional grills thermostat i would advise since this product is 24.99 to purchase something else too so you can take advantage of the free shipping i didnt really need anything else so i picked up a 1.99 cat toy and got the free shipping instead of forking out the 14 bucks shipping would have cost without the additional purchase
sadly i bought this item from a link in google that took me to amazon and did n't list all the sources on amazon that sold it i ended up paying 15 or so more than necessary for it since their price was more than target 's shipped price i bought it at beach audio through amazon for 33.07 with a shipping charge of 14.35 for a final price of 47.42 had i realized i should have on amazon for the brand and model number i would have found it from target at the 25 listed price and shipping under 7 ! ! ! a substantial savings however sad as i am that i could have saved a few of my social security bucks i 'm totally amazed at the job this tiny fan is doing for me here 's my situation and though i 'm sure yours is quite different you can see the value of the appliance i 'm a retired person living upstairs in a tiny living quarters with someone else living downstairs who is in control of the heating and cooling of the house during the fall and spring when it 's nice outside the house heat is turned on and migrates upward to become trapped in my tiny living quarters if i open a window the heat goes out and the heating system comes back on to make more i 'm sure this causes their electric bill to skyrocket i found that if i become uncomfortable i can close my door and my air conditioning vent and crack a window for fresh air allowing the heat transmitted through the floor to warm the room this works pretty well but sometimes not much air comes in the window and occasional birds and insects to find their way in the little honeywell fit one of my windows perfectly and can be set to quietly blow air in and out at the same time and it 's thermostatically controlled so it can hold the room at exactly the temperature i like if i want to smoke a cigar or my pipe i can set it to exhaust through both fans or to circulate in and out faster so i do n't have to worry about poluting the air throughout the house be sure the door and vent are closed before doing this they will notice SMILE the fan blades are plastic but well enough made so the low setting is not objectionable at all i had tried a 20 '' box fan to exhaust air before but that was extremely noisy even at the lowest setting the low setting on this one makes no more noise than my computer fan and still moves air so well i immediately feel the fresh air i paid too much for it but it 's worth twice the price to me i 'm a happy old man and very pleased with my purchase i hope it lasts a long time
i bought this fan to replace one that was broken during moving this is the second one we have purchased and it is a great product the ability to vent air with the flick of a switch is very useful the thermostat works quite well and the twin fans have a good amount of circulation power for a fan this size i would recommend this fan to anyone
this is a kitchen item i would n't want to be without it gets constant use never used a cooking device that i could brown steam and cook in such a short time with better results than a slow cooker microwave or the oven from asparagus to pot roasts and soups it never fails best purchase i 've made in years the real plus about it is the removable liner makes cleanup a snap
i 've been using this pressure cooker for the past 3 years it is by far the best appliance in the kitchen i use it to cook chicken and pork stock broth i store the broth frozen in empty milk plastic containers this way i always have some available for soup or various usage in fact since content of the pressure cooker is essentially sterile as in canning i 've been able to store the content for up to 2 days if i do n't open the lid it can probably last longer but i 've never tried it you wont regret buying this one
the pressure cooker works really well the most notable advantages are very quite and big internal space as suggested by other reviewers the thermal fuse is a problem the power off problem also occurred in my cooker but you can buy a replacement thermal fuse from radioshack for 1.49 it took me about 40 minutes to replace the fuse the fuse is located at the bottom of the cooker replacement is not a big job if you know who to do it
owned this unit for 8 months i use it about 5 times a week and i think its the best kitchen gadget ever however last month it stopped working and i was not happy because i needed it for a dinner party the next day so in desperation i took it apart and in the bottom of the unit in a plastic box the one that has two spring loaded buttons you will find a fuse like device called a tco or thermal cut off it looks like a diode in a plastic tube they 're installed on alot of appliances that have heating elements like coffee brewers the tco used is rated at 128 degrees fahrenheit i happen to have the exact tco from a bissle carpet scrubber replaced the tco with that one and viola i 'm back in business i would not recommend this fix for those who are n't mechanically inclined
this product exceeded expectations and has expanded our menu due to ease of operation and cleanup can not go wrong on this one
this is a great pressure cooker only drawbacks and they 're minor are that it 's a little heavy and you have to hold down a button for quick steam release other than that i have no complaints it 's the most used appliance in my kitchen
i love this pressure cooker i have tried two others and hated them the feature that is the best is the digital readout no more guessing about the pressure i would highly recommend this to all my friends
first of all this thing is huge ! make shure you have the space all of the features work as advertised the browning feature works much better than we thought it would just like a skillet quiet compared to a stovetop unit and much safer build quality is excellent easy to clean just what we
recieved the cooker very promptly loved it but it quit working after 1 week this was definitely not the sellers fault and i was refunded the cost quite promptly the cooker while it worked was absolutely awesome
although the lights are very pretty the information in the box states that the lights are to be used on a short term basis no more then 90 days and to be put indoors or dry outdoors when i was searching for lights i depended on the information given to me in the description nowhere that i saw when i ordered the lights did it specify those instructions i bought lights that i can not use
i often heard about the benefits of using reidel crystal to enhance the flavor and bouquet of wine but never tried it until i bought this set and it is true i chose a nice bottle of petit syrah wine but it was even better than usual in the reidal stemware be prepared it is a really big piece of stemware
the riedel vinum series of stemware is very good and the glass is no exception the size and shape of the bowl really do enhance the bouquets of chateauneuf de pape cornas gigondas and other southern and northern rhone wines as well as australian or californian based wines i 've also found it to be quite good for brunellos and some based the only drawback is having to buy six which may be more than some people need if you do a little searching on the web you 'll find that these glasses are available singly from some retailers however that said this is not a bad glass for everyday use if you prefer to have just one glass for red wine i 'd probably choose the spiegelau vino grande magnum bordeaux glass for that purpose but each to his own
we currently live in france a country where wine is etched into the national consciousness we invited some french friends over to compare australian and french wines of the same grape varieties chardonnay cabernet merlot but did n't have enough riedel glasses to go around some of us were consistently rating wines lower and then we realised that they had the glasses a quick tour of the table with the same wine in the two types of glass convinced everybody of the merits of this glassware a tip on washing one pain is the need to these glasses a sommelier gave us the tip that to avoid breaking riedels while washing do not hold the stem to turn the glass while cleaning it hold the whole bowl with one hand while using a wash cloth with the other
i attended tulsa chef fest 2002 in november and attended a riedel conducted seminar sampling a series of wines from around the world i was skeptical but after the seminar i am rabid convert preaching the word the effect of these glasses on wine is simply amazing in the subsequent couple of weeks my wife and i purchased several of the vinum series bordeaux '' chablis '' chardonnay sauvignon blanc '' and syrah '' we will be adding more in time the syrah glasses are particular effective at concentrating the nose of the australian and south african wines we have already enjoyed your satisfaction is guaranteed and the price even at full retail is worth every penny for the years you will enjoy with this superb glassware
there are n't any wine glasses out there that i prefer over the riedel vinum series except the sommelier of course i do have one observation though and this is why i did n't give this glass a 5 star rating the vinums that i 've purchased in the past 5 months do n't seem to be up to the same quality standards of the vinums i purchased a year ago the older '' vinum which has the logo etched in the base has a cut rim and the bowl seems to be thinner making the entire glass look feel and sound more elegant the new '' vinum which has the logo and riedel '' name etched in the base has a lip which looks slightly rounded in a comparison with the older '' glass and the itself seems thicker maybe riedel made some changes to improve durability but i like my old riedels better all in all as i said at the beginning of this review there is nothing better out there than the riedel vinum series as long as you do n't pay full retail
i received the riedel syrah glasses as a gift after lusting after them for ages i now wish i 'd just bought them for myself my husband and i did a tasting of a yummy rhone in our regular glasses and in the riedels no comparison the riedels are great plus they 're beautiful
i have a kitchen full of gadgets and most my wife just rolls her eyes about but the first time she used this she could n't say enough about it now a year later she still says how much she prefers it over our other pastry cutters which have all been thrown out
the name fits this is the best pastry blender it 's like a small potato masher with the strength that suggests we had two previous pastry blenders that tended to bend and twist one use of this little brute and the others went to goodwill and good riddance
this is a pot rack the shape is very adaptable compares favorably with racks sold by williams sonoma for more than 150.00 one of our best amazon purchases ever
i was very please not only with the product once i received it but the speedy amount of time it took from the time i ordered it until i received it it is extremely sturdy and looks exactly as it did on the internet i am very happy with my purchase and will probably order again from this website
this has to be the most beautiful paper towel holder that i have ever seen
this item was shipped quickly and arrived sooner then promised it is a beautiful piece and i get compliments from everyone thanks
what a wonderful way to have paper towels in a kitchen ! arthur court items are so beautiful and look so much like fine many people wonder where in the world i found a pewter paper towel holder and it is a perfect design in actually helping to pull off paper towels according to my husband do not hesitate on this one
i have the other tri ply cookware but wanted a version pan that was in the tri ply line i love it ! go with the 12 inch if you are only going to get one pan as it will cover all your needs easy to clean and i love that it matches the stainless pans i so they can all hang from the pot rack
this skillet is wonderful very well balanced even heating and extremely easy to clean i love it and will buy the 10 '' at a later date
i tried the regular calphalon stainless steel saute pan and took it back too much work to clean and it was very heavy then i bought the nonstick stainless steel omelet pan it provided quick even cooking and is very easy to clean cheese sauces and eggs just glide off onto the plate and whatever residue is left is a breeze to clean also it is not as heavy as regular calphalon pans furthermore the handle does not get hot i am now looking for more pieces my old pots and pans were wedding presents from 39 years ago
even when i bought the fiestawere cinnabar creamer i loved it right away but to order the cinnabar covered suger bowl from a nother seller and have them match so well i am so happy that my sugar bowl is such a perfect match thank
this sleeping bag is perfect for younger kids it 's certainly not made for heavy outdoor use it 's pretty lightweight but is perfect for slumber parties '' in my kids ' rooms my only concern is the straps that keep it rolled up while not in use if the bag is unrolled and you want to keep the straps from tripping someone etc you can loop them back and close them with a velcro tab creating a choking hazard if you do n't reattach them the velcro can attach itself to the bag itself and interfere with the zipper
this blender is simply just powerful good looking blender that is so simple i bet even george bush can use it no offense to republicans i am one of you anyway this thing can blend or crush or chop or anything depending on the settings to your will from frozen cranberries to sticky gummy bears do n't ask and no matter how many foodstuffs you mix in of different types or in different stages of matter it can throughly blend them to make smooth combo drinks or throughly spread flavored salsa or just knock out the lumps in pudding or gravy to the point that it would cause a french chief to weep with jealousy i 'm a person who hates cleaning to be honest but simply this blender is just easy to clean despite what type of mess i make in the blending jar or button counter from sticky milkshake to greasy gravy i 'm a person who when i buy something i do n't read the instructions i just try to get a feel on how to use it and simply all of this blender 's vast settings are with no instructions needed so i got the feel of it in
works well as expected this is a replacement for the same pan model that served us for over 10 years we expect the same from this one
i love the two pans i bought they are exactly what i need to make swedish pancakes 2 at a time they are also the perfect size for omelettes
i use this item as additional pantry space the kitchen in my new apartment is small and did n't have enough space to store everything i hung this storage rack over the back of a closet door and use it for boxes of dry goods and some canned foods as well it holds quite a bit for its size and is very sturdy my one caution if you 're going to hang this over the door use the included screws and clips to mount it to the door if you do n't when you the door it rattles around a lot
this gadget is wonderful for frothing up low fat milk in the cup before adding your coffee it gives a lasting froth that adds to the pleasure of your drink there are other frothers around that have a coiled circle at the bottom but these do n't do as good a job the battries last a long time and the motor is strong enough for at least 2 years of daily use
okay sorry about the alliteration powered by four aa batteries this little speedster works really really well turning a of milk into a cup of rich foamy goodness in about 15 seconds the stand is sturdy and balanced and keeps the little guy within easy reach of your espresso machine i knocked off one star because i wish the power button atop the handle was an rather than a job a minor quibble to be sure
this is the second frother i 've bought and it really has some power to it nice and compact gives a great quick froth esp for the price also works well on blending single servings of salad dressing just do n't get the battery part wet
this is an excellent battery powered mixer for items like chocolate milk protein drinks cocoa high fiber drinks frothing milk for coffee powdered drinks and other small mixing jobs
this compact unit is comfortable in the hand attractive on the counter and works incredibly ! froths even whole milk so fast better than more expensive and bulkier units in performance yeah
i bought one a few years ago got hooked ca n't drink my morning coffee without frothy milk ! it finally broke so i went online to replace it i 've seen other types but this style is the one i had to have ! found it new at for the same price i paid years ago it came in a few days and works beautifully i 'm a happy camper again
this is a great way to cut back on starbucks trips but the blade at the end of the wand was very loose after a few uses i have to be sure it is tight before each use but it works well
this pan is a great value sure it 's a little small but you can see that when you order it 's only 7 '' not 12 '' after all i 've had two of these pans for four years now and they 're wonderful buy these and buy the 12 '' one too you wo n't be sorry
i only have one pan i 'd like to have more i love this little pan i use it all the time for cooking different things a hamburger some linguicia portuguese sausage and eggs i use some canola oil in it for something that might stick such as an egg i have no problem cleaning it at all ! as soon as i am done frying something i put some water in the pan whatever might be stuck to it comes right off even better than with a surface having used 'cheap ' pans my whole life it was amazing the difference it makes using a pan that works the way it should it makes cooking fun ! love my little pan
this is the best saute pan i have ever used it provides perfectly even heating and is very easy to clean
i have to say that i am very happy with my ltd pieces including this little fry pan because of the price i picked up this one and the 1 qt sauce pan to give them a try my family used to cook with the all ss line so i knew that these would be quality and i was not let down yes stainless is more difficult to cook with but have you tried hard anodised pots impossible that 's why my equally beautiful imo calphalon professional pots are looking great as kitchen decorations and not much else your food will only burn if you are not paying attention to it if you are having this problem try so you can go do whatever else it is you want to do other than paying attention to your food if you are looking for top quality cookware that is oven safe lasts a lifetime and demands a little more care from the chef this is it
we bought 20 of these li'l darlins for the saute ' line at work and procceded to attempt their destruction and rapid demise to no avail they do a great job on our 500 degree flat top and over our ring burners as well we cook quickly and efficiently so perhaps our style helps us avoid the previously mentioned problems for we do use the 8 '' non stick version crepes no problem the adonized finish has held up well after 6 months and hundreds of trips through our commercial dishmachine do n't try that at home it voids the warranty we like 'em ! ! ! caveat the stainless or line would have better suited our needs in the potsink as these do n't like to be scrubbed with steel scrubbies hence 4 instead of
i 've tried all types of pans including calphalon and has them all beat nothing cooks more evenly and food does n't stick to the pan as much as it does to calphalon pans consumer reports also rates the frying pan as the best on the market ahead of other famous brands besides this one i have 7 other pans and they 're all fabulous i would n't cook on anything else
i thought this looked like a nice pan so i thought i would give it a try wow it cooks and cleans up like a dream i ordered another one for myself and one for my friend
i 'm sure there are cutlery snobs out there who would turn up their nose at anything that you can find in the local bedding bathing further '' type store but this thing is wicked it 's a huge huge step up from the generic chefmate set i got a while back i cut a tomato in half quite literally on accident while the old knife would take enough pressure to deform the poor little fruit or some sort of sawing think of this as an introduction to proper knives if you must but i ca n't see a reason to get anything else unless it 's the 10 '' version ! incidentally i chose this over wusthof henkel etc because the handle fit my hand the best and i like the japanese style '' blade with no bolster i 'd recommend going to a brick mortar to get a feel for the options before buying
using this knife has turned me into a snob i have cooked at a few other people 's houses since getting my shun and with their knives it feels like i 'm trying to saw through something with my finger you ca n't explain how sharp this thing is a friend of mine concurred and said she too is now annoyed when using a regular '' knife a few weeks after getting the i bought the paring one with just these two i can do about everything i need a sharp knife for
this is my fourth shun knife and it looks like i 'm going for the complete set me and the rest of my crew ! you see i work as a sous chef in a busy restaurant and over the years have amassed two yes 2 ! complete sets of german knives great knives themselves but when my exec chef recently threw over his beloved forschner knives for these shuns i had to found out why so i bought my first one a 7 in santoku it instantly became my favorite ! i used it for the bulk of my chopping and dicing and i do alot of that the handles are fabulous they give you a good grip comfortable for the long haul and when your fingers are wet or oily my only complaint about the santoku is that it does n't seem to keep it 's sharp edge as long it 's a little thicker than the other blades and it takes more steel '' time to get it back to razor sharp pretty well impressed i moved on to the big work horse the 10 in chef ok it 's now my favorite it handles the bigger slicing jobs with such ease it 's a dream to use and it was this knife that sold my crew on shuns now three out of five of them have at least one shun knife the 8 in chef and looking to buy more i still use my german knives they continue to have their place in a restaurant kitchen with all the varied prep tasks that i have to do but i find that the shuns come out more often than any other and as we all stand around the prep tables furiously working every one of us has a shun in our hand these knives are definitely worth the investment
my favorite is the model ! this shun knife like all the others is a terrific high quality blade they are perfect ! i hate to use the term balanced '' in a knife review but it really feels great in the hand the d shaped grip '' feels nice and the knife really holds an edge
i purchased this fine piece of cutlerly on some gift money last christmas little did i know how good of a purchase this thing was going to be when i got it home i instantly noticed the weight of the instrument and how well balanced it is between the handle and blade i fell in love with it during the first meal i used it to prepare veggies meat even poultry were easy fare only downsides i 've had sometimes a little big for delicate or finesse tasks but that 's why god invented the utility and paring knives also i have a horrible fear of dropping this heavy sharp object on my feet in the kitchen ! i 've made it a personal point to always wear a sturdy pair of shoes while using this knife in particular overall this knife is worth every penny
i got this knife for my wife who is a chef she says it is the best present i have ever given her the weight and balance are perfect and the edge is amazing she just placed the edge of the knife on a piece of paper and suddenly we had two pieces of paper the knife is also visually impressive she does a lot of cooking and now wants a whole set of these knifes at least i know what to get for her next birthday we hoped that the knife would come with some 'how to care for ' type instructions but it does not
i read a lot of reviews before making this purchase then i went to a williams sonoma and handled the knife before making a final decision many have recommended that you handle the knives before purchasing i also recommend this holding the knife in my hand is what locked the sale for me ! i own a set of trident wusthof grand prix kninves and wonderful knives they are as i 've been trying to teach myself better knife skills i 've been working at forming the proper hold what chefs call the pinch '' hold with the wusthoff i have to concentrate on it because the knife never fit in my hand perfectly the shun is amazing in this regard i will also say that i do have small hands that seems to make a difference in whether many will like the shun or not but it definitely felt natural in my hand i handled the global alongside the shun and put it down immediately do n't like the grip at all ! i 've only been using the shun for two days but have already started thinking about a couple more additions to the ol ' knife block is it sharp absolutely everything cut like warm butter is that design or the fact that it 's brand new i 'll know in a few weeks ! again before you purchase handle the knife in a store or a freinds kitchen or something the way a knife feels in your hand should be the major decider
i believe if you 're serious about cooking you should own great cookware and excellent knives i finally stepped up and got excellent knives for those who have n't heard the hype shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world check them out on the web at great features of the entire line include these cool d '' shaped handles that fit your hand better each knife is made in a and version for lefties the handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe ! ! the steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives the knives are extremely sharp one thing to note about asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle degrees 20 degrees for german knives the shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle i have small hands and this knife felt perfect the weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand this knife makes quick work of everything because it is so sharp it is also much lighter than my previous knife so i feel like i 'm using a lot less force to slice and chop i have the 7 '' santoku as well but this is the knife that i will use for the majority of the prep this is an expensive but lifetime investment i encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them for more info on shun check out alton brown 's website for ratings on various brands and types of knives check out ' equipment ratings this is probably the best kitchen purchase i 've made and the one i 'm most proud of
i picked this blade up the other day and am thrilled with it though it was moe expensive than the wustof that i had intended to buy i do n't regret it lighter sharper edge and wait for it a left handed handle ! ! ! ! all you right handers out there would n't understand the novelty of actually having a kitchen that we can use properly with our dominant hand pretty hard to find actually definitely cuts down on accidents and messes while cooking according to the clerk that i talked to very knowledgable shun only standardly makes the 8 '' shef knife and the paring knife for us lefties the others can be special ordered and the place i went to has no for that but if there 's a sale the discount is n't as much probably to cover the upcharge that the store is charge for the order do n't think i can advertise for them but if you 're in seattle go to the water side of westlake and turn left down
no more messy fingers this is the most awesome tool for peanut butter mayo and even butter love it ! also great for scraping out bowls
this is the best vacuum on the market for removing cat hair from your furniture and bedspread it is far above using a pet hair remover tape it is great for the quick cleanups of tracked litter as well i love it
i 'm quite pleased with the performance of my power reach perhaps because i 'm using it strictly on smooth upholstery to pick up small messes and to vacuum crud out of crevices it would never have occurred to me to use a handheld as many of the dissatisfied reviewers seem to have done for anything more extensive i like its design with the detaching hose and head and the crevice tool stowed in the case it could be improved by being slightly more powerful and by having a brush that is engaged by belt or gears for what i paid though i think i got a good deal my only complaint it is the loudest vacuum i 've ever run across wear your earplugs with this one !
i have this fan in my stereo cabinet so it will keep my xbox and equip cool on its lowest setting it does that not really on the noisy side the whir of the motor is only matched by the sound of the wind comming out of the thing so far no problems and is a steal for the price
i wanted a fan for my desk at the office and it had to be relatively quite i found it in this item it does n't take up much space and does the job i love it
we have this in our bedroom and it is awesome ours is dead quiet one of the reasons we love it and puts out a great amount of air for such a small fan we also love the timer as it allows us to get the room cool for us to go to sleep and then turns itself off so we do n't freeze or jack up the elecric bill we also have it 's big brother the 40 '' tower in our living room again it 's so quiet we forget it 's even on except for the nice cool breeze definately
after looking at local stores and at more expensive brands on line we decided to take a chance on these i am glad we did they are very nice and good quality my kids love them we are planning to order another set soon
i purchased these barstools about a year ago they were quite simple to assemble i 'm not the best at assembling things once put together they were very sturdy the seat itself is quite comfy although the back of the seat does not provide the support that it boasts overall this is a nice set of barstools and can really add a bit of flair and style to a bar or counter
beautiful bowls cobalt blue on the outside french white on the inside these bowls are very heavy a sign of durability these bowls are going to last a long time and i plan on ordering more
first perspective that got the 4 rating love the bowls feel a bit ripped by the price over 20 a bowl is a lot to pay but for cereal and icecream these bowls are great do n't buy enough for a large meal or table setting these are for you and your favorite book in bed on saturday morning deep bowls but not too large perfect for cereal and milk ca n't change the score but adding commentary bowls do not wear as well as i would like the insides get scratched up and do not look as good plus you can not microwave them i would not recommend versus cheaper bowls at crate and barrel that i bought later
these bowls are gorgeous very sturdy a wonderful addition to anyones kitchen
i find that i use these almost daily they basically have become my new prep bowls for small amounts nice quality easy stacking even great color will probably buy a second set
my grandson purchased the set of bowls for me something i keep on the counter at all times just so handy to have for all of my some pieces of mario cookware too which i just love
i love this set i held off for a long time since i thought them a bit pricy they are worth every cent ! i leave them on the counter and use them everyday i am doing the weight watchers point diet and these are great ! i measure and often just eat out of them too the fact each cup has two measures is wonderful i plan to get some as gifts for friends who also follow a diet even if you do n't diet they are super measureing cups very heavy duty you will not regret getting these
makes preparing meals neater and easier a must have in the kitche
even though the sizes are listed i missed that and from the picture thought they were bigger after i got over the initial disappointment in size i realized they were really great to have for prep i am going back to school to be a chef and am really trying to practice mise en place in my own kitchen i think that is how you spell it i better learn before my final this set is great for the prep because it has two measuring amounts in one like cup and 1.5 in the same cup which i came to realize has helped i bought these and the oxo prep bowl set with lids assuming i would try both and give one away i ended up keeping and using both
if you believe in preping ingredients before you cook as i do these bowls are extremely handy particularly as they each have a line inside that indicates the bowl 's measure 1 cup bowl has a cup line etc this effectively doubles their use they seem very rugged and easy to clean as well
i love my bowl set but a little disappointed that there was no cup in the measurements
i love love my set ! you have fun colors to choose from and they do n't disappoint in person ! there is a half way measuring line in each bowl to make it really nifty ! when i first got them i dropped the whole set from counter height i was worried about cracking the plastic bowls and was happy to find all were in perfect shape regardless of my little mishap ! so they are durable stylish and extremely useful ! i say buy a set you wo n't be disappointed
every kitchen should have a set of these measuring bowls i gave them to all my family for gifts and they love them too great for measuring shortening peanut butter etc because its easy to scrape out the bowl also good for nuts raisens and coconut i 'm so glad i found them in the specialty shop when no stores in our entire area carried them i was very happy to find them on
i purchased this item for myself and when my husband saw it he wanted a set for his cook on the boat i use it everynight when cooking good job mario ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love my new salad bowl set the color is beautiful so is the quality and you ca n't beat the price
very lovely ! it will accompanying any table service nicely ! amazon did well in getting the set to me in a very timely manner completely happy with the purchase
i get a lot of compliments on this cherry salad bowl set the bowls have an attractive smooth texture and are the perfect size for not only side salads but cereal soup and snacks because they 're deep i always use the serving bowl when i make a batch of french fries and it also makes a terrific popcorn bowl i suggest because some of the finish peels off if you leave water in the bowls for an extended period of time
i love the reidel line of wine glasses both stemless and with stems they are delicate though so not for the clumsy although maybe stemless is better for the klutz since it has less opportunity to fall over they make great gifts
the riedel o '' concept glasses may take a short while to accept but once one realizes that a quality wine glass does not require a stem the rewards are many the o '' glass line of products have made legendary glass maker riedel 's products affordable for the masses while injecting an element of practicality for daily use as a current owner of both traditional priced riedel stemware and these newer products i find our o '' glasses are getting much higher use they truly do enhance the flavors of good quality wines while helping the wine drinker collect multiple glass ware designs at reasonable prices i now have five different o '' styles on the shelf yet these wide mouth chardonnay glasses seem to get the biggest workout they somehow do have the capability of bringing out the nuances of a wine even for us less sophisticated buyers plus my wife loves popping them in the dishwasher !
riedel glasses are great way to give a great gift ! opens the wine wonerful and i love the feel of the glass too it the perfect way to drink napa valley wine in a fancy glass
i love these thin wine glasses can not enjoy a glass of wine in a thick glass have ordered many sets of these and given them as gifts but for some reason i break them when drying them with a dish towel i have never put them in my dish washer and i always make sure the glass is warm when i wash i guess they are super fragile and need to be air dried in spite of this problem i will again order another set as i can not drink a good glass of wine in a thick rimmed glass
while there are many positives to this line of glasses there is one thing that bothers me when you drink from them you leave fingerprints normally on stemmed glasses they are not seen but with these glasses after several sips of your favorite wine the glasses are covered with fingerprints still love the shape though
very pleased with the glasses we already had the cabernet glasses and wanted to add to the collection they are such delicate crystal i feel like it 's a special occasion when i use them i also like the look as it is different than any other wine glasses we have they are a great conversation piece
the riedel o chardonnay is just the right size for informal gatherings with friends it holds just the right amount too a little more generous than the stem version all my friends think it is a cool shape and you do n't have to worry about breaking the stem when you set it down i have n't broken one yet while washing them ! thats the best part
this chair is so nice and looks more expensive then it really is very easy to put togther this chick did it all by herself in about 20 minutes very roomy and comfortable i also got the matching ottoman looks great
its very roomy bigger than i thought it was going to be not in a bad way cozy and very sleek and stylish looks much much more expensive than it is highly reccomended
i was skeptical buying a chair with only a picture to go by i 'm glad i decided to go ahead and give it a try i have a small room i use for an ofice and was looking for a corner chair that would be comfortable to sit in without a big footprint this fits the bill the chair is sturdy the cushions comfortable and the assembly simple and straight forward i 'd recommend buying the ottoman to go with it it 's as well made as the chair and a perfect companio piece
i love the end product has the appearance and feel of a chair worth twice the price and was exactly what i wanted however ! ! ! the instructions for assembly leave certain steps to the imagination at one point in the assembly there were 2 possible ways to go i guessed correctly and did not have to backtrack and take anything apart a bit of a frustrating experience to say the least is the frustration worth it without a doubt
the sleek clean lines simplicity and fabric make this piece of furniture very versatile i have put it in my living room to coordinate with a modern theme it can very easily fit into various other styles of design it was easy to put together and was shipped farely fast in terms of comfort it is in the moderate range and durabilty seems to be in that range as well i have received several comments on the chair all of which have been positive for the price it is a good buy and recommend it highly
my title sums it up i really had low expectations for this chair but it performs like a champ it 's in our children 's room and it gets knocked about a good deal but it still looks reasonably elegant and much more expensive than it really is i 'd recommend it unconditionally indeed i just bought another for my office SMILE worth every penny and then some
i love these chairs br they were not as difficult to put together as others have said i get great compliments they look like i bought them at one of the more expensive furniture stores i have an antique wood table that i put in the middle and it looks great people ca n't believe that i bought them from target ! i was lucky i got them when they were on sale so it was a great deal but the price is still good my saw them and now i am online to buy her two for her little apt ! target has come a long way with their collection br
this is a great little pot for sauteeing onions before adding a 28 oz can of italian tomatoes or for risotto for 1 to 4 people do n't be put off by the small size if you cook for one or two people and appreciate quality cookware then this is the pot for you worth every penny
i got this to use with the glorious one pot meals cookbook it has wonderful recipies and the pot works wonderful cleans up really easy try it you 'll love it sharon from colorad
i started buying le creuset after watching the cooking shows on the cooking netwook so many of the cooks use this cookware even if they have there own line like emeril very expensive but well worth the money
i ca n't believe how much i actually use this pot it 's great for roasts and braising it 's fantastic for boiling pasta or for deep frying big batches of onion rings for all the neighbors it takes a while to heat up but once it hit it 's temp it does not cool down my wife is a klutz and she 's dropped the lid several times not one ding or chip it 's pretty easy to clean too sometimes it takes a bit of bar keepers friend and a little elbow grease but it looks so nice you can bring it from oven to table i expect my children to fight over this the day after my funeral maybe i need another
i agree with those reviewers who 've said that this oven is not something you 'll be making stews or casseroles in it 's too small for that it is however absolutely perfect for cooking grains which is why it gets more daily use in my kitchen than my bigger french ovens do it 's fabulous for rice oatmeal grits you name it the fact it performs beautifully both on the stovetop and the oven makes it excellent for pilafs since you can execute every aspect of pilaf production in the same pot this is a very worthwhile addition to anybody 's kitchen
i so enjoy this pot it heats evenly and retains heat i can make a pot of something after school and then turn the off and the food is still fairly warm when the kids want dinner with the two quart size i can experiment effortlessly with healthier no salt dishes for myself while the family enjoys something else it 's a pretty pan that lives on our stove a gentle reminder to drag out a cookbook and try something new it 's cooking literally outside the box
i got tired of burning my stocks with junk pots and decided to do some research this pot is a big improvement over the standard cuisinart line of pots and pans and is on par with the better pots and other brands the fit and finish on this unit is excellent and the lid fits like a glove this is a true 3 layer walled pot no welded discs to the bottom of the unit like the bargain in the brand compare the price of this pot with the 'real ' constructed pots and you 'll see a improvement in price i 've used this pot times since i purchased it each time for stock simmering and it still looks like new highly recommended
as the description describes this salt and pepper shaker set is stable and durable especially in the dishwasher however if one fills each shaker to capacity they become quite heavy perhaps too heavy to be passed comfortably at dinner the shakers are not demarcated and the head design is such that they would look substantially similar one shaker has four holes and the other has three thus it become confusing as to which condiment is in which container still though i will take durability over the other drawbacks
we ordered this item and it 's not only useful as a trivet to place hot pots on but also great to use as a oven mitt it 's very flexible so when i pulled out a hot cookie sheet my fingers did n't get burned ! i highly recommend it it is a bit tricky to grasp the hot items but you just have to arranget it so
this is the best coffee maker had to buy the replacement carafe becasue i foolishly broke the original carafe by leaving it in the sink while washing other dishes found it on amazon had the cheapest price ! !
used the original for 2 years and broke the carafe in sink ordered this replacement it was perfect good price good delivery product as promised
the carafe was a perfect replacement for the one that i broke i received the product within a few days thank you
krups is the ultimate in coffee makers a gourmet delight the flavor and aroma are the chefs delight the carafe is artistically and designed to please your eye it is functional and easy to clean the price is economical buy by all means
i read alot of the reviews before buying this toaster some of them we not good ones but i bought the toaster anyway because of the features that it offered first of all the color of the toater is great and it matches my kitchen perfectly it does n't take up too much room on the countertop because it is somewhat slim it does all of the things it professes to do it does sometimes cook the toast more on one edge so it does n't look perfect '' but it is not that big of a difference that it ruins the toast it by no means chars it it is just a little bit darker i tried the frozen feature and loved it i had some homemade frozen waffles and it thawed them and then heated them perfectly i would buy this toaster again if i needed a toaster i really like it alot
the digital that i have is a great way to get perfect toast if anyone burns there toast it 's not the toasters fault they do n't know how to cook
this is avery attractive and functional product that performs nicely as advertisied although i used the free and slowest shipping option the product arrived a week eralier than amazon estimated it would good deal glen
these are the best dog leashes we 've owned everything about them is high quality and best of all they are made in the usa ! i have two different patterns for my two dogs the puppy got a hold of the leash and chewed it up lupine replaced it promptly
i have never been happier with a kitchen knife it is sharp weighted perfectly and elegant to boot if you purchase this knife you can throw away all of your other kitchen knives of comparable purpose
i 've been a long time henckels user and love there knives but my shun classic has quickly made it 's way to the most used knife in my bag when i first got this knife i was afraid to use it in the day to day world of my job because of it 's good looks but unlike most knives that just rely on there good looks for the selling point this knife is a true work horse the handle did feel a little strange at first but once you get used to it you understand why it was made that way as a chef i recomend this knife to any santoku lover it was well worth the price
very good knife althrough the hollow ground was a big deal but to me 8 inch chief is too big
this knife is absolutely amazing cuts through chicken and other meat like a hot knife through butter be extremely careful while cutting
this shun knife like all the others is a terrific high quality blade they are perfect ! i hate to use the term balanced '' in a knife review but it really feels great in the hand the d shaped grip '' feels nice and the knife really holds an edge
the good reviews sum it up aptly but i would like to add that after owning a set of henckels i grew to loathe in the extreme they never hold an edge and sharpening is not cheap ! and after testing every set at shun handles are the perfect fit for those with hands smaller than the average seemingly german male for whom almost all kitchen equipment is designed nevermind that most people actually cooking in most homes on a daily basis are women rant aside this knife is all that and a bag of chips tomatoes are a breeze with this knife as is everything else i have thrown at it so far they are insanely sharp and they really hold an edge my food prep time has been cut in half since owning this and the ken onion chef knife they 're just so much sharper and they do n't slip around because they really fit my hand and have the perfect heft if you can only afford one good knife i 'd probably pick the shun chef knife although the handle of the santoku is better and it can do most everything the chef 's knife can do but if you can afford it get them both you wo n't need anything else
this is a great knife everyone agrees but is this knife that much better than its cheaper competitors mac wustoff etc knives which cost over 40 after purchasing this knife i am convinced it is not this knife is very sharp indeed and you wo n't complain about its sharpness but some of the reviews in amazon hype it to a point where it can cut through anything no this is n't a ginsu not the tv commercial version anyway and it ca n't cut through nails the reviews on other high quality knives especially mac knives are just as good in fact one consumer quality magazine rates the mac knives over the shun my guess is that those knives are just as sharp and good since the sharpness of this knife is n't awe inspiring
i 've decided to go with mac brand santoku after reading several reviews
update i can say now that i have no regrets this knife is actually my favorite knife and the one i reach for first i have to force myself to use my chef 's knife my shuns are still sharp ! i believe if you 're serious about cooking you should own great cookware and excellent knives i finally stepped up and got excellent knives for those who have n't heard the hype shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world great features of the entire line include these cool d '' shaped handles that fit your hand better each knife is made in a and version the handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe ! ! the steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives the knives are extremely sharp one thing to note about asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle degrees 20 degrees for german knives the shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle about the 7 '' scalloped santoku this is my first shun knife it is honestly the sharpest knife i have ever used i minced onion with relatively no effort i did n't feel any resistance while cutting and the job went amazingly quickly i have small hands and this knife felt perfect the weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand i will have to make adjustments to my grip as i get used to the knife i used the traditional grip you would use on a german blade chef 's knife my hand slipped toward the blade this knife will not replace my chef 's knife but it will see a lot of action this is an expensive but lifetime investment i encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them for more info on shun check out alton brown 's website for ratings on various brands and types of knives this is probably the best kitchen purchase i 've made and the one i 'm most proud of i ca n't wait until the rest of the set arrives
i have a shun santoku and it is very nice a good sharp cutting knive however i have found something even better for roughly the same cost a kin the kin is more decorative just as sharp and offers that extra cache of owning a smaller brand more exclusive try a kin and get amazon to carry them
this press lives up to it 's marketing description my only concern is how to replace the glass insert i tried a generic replacement and although it fit okay the pouring lip is narrower than the original and leaks at the edges how do i get an original glass replacement
this bathmat is a perfect match to the towels it is a little larger than expected and is a bathmat not a bath rug therefore there are no rubber grippers the mat is exactly as pictured the weave is slightly different on each side
the salter 1400 scale is great i use it for carbohydrate counting and find it very convenient to use i especially like being able to use the program which gives me the the nutritional information for the exact weight of the item i have put on the scale
this product is sturdy and has plenty of room for my 9.5 lb shih tzu it 's easy to use and lucy loves it the only thing i wish is that there was an option to purchase a carrying case to put crate in when not in use and we need to tote it from one place to another for example i 'd like to be able to check it at the airport and feel that it 's somewhat protected lucy travels us in an airline approved pet carrier
in the past i have used the old stand by wire crates for my dogs i recently got a new puppy a maltipoo who is smaller than the dogs i have had in the past so i was looking for a smaller wire crate when i found this i love it ! this crate is easy to take up and down when visiting relatives it is very easy to pack up and take with us with soft sides i frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping the walls '' on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate i bought the small which gives him plenty of room to move around at night i have him sleeping in a small airline crate he is getting too big for that so i am thinking of getting the extra small for night time use
do n't plan on using this as an crate puppies will chew through it if you try to use it as a permanent training crate it was n't intended to be treated as airline baggage i got it primarily to get my puppy through her first long car trip home i 'm now using it as a safe way to take her on short trips and to train her to ride she seems to find it very secure comfortable and reassuring it sets up and folds quickly and easily it is light and easy to handle but very sturdy i use it mostly in the passenger seat of my car but would n't mind putting it in the back with my adult dog something i would n't dream of with a hard metal crate the one time the puppy upchucked the cleanup was trivial the bottom pan is held in place by velcro it got pulled out in a few seconds and then got hosed down the soft pad got hosed down and thrown into the washer and dryer i do n't plan to use this more than a few months but at the end of that time i expect to have a sturdy confident and happy dog traveler
i bought this soft sided pet crate in hopes that my new yorkie terrier brando would have a safe haven to welcome him home since he is such a tiny guy this crate offers both a play area and a bedroom the construction is very durable and the color red my favorite is fun i particularly like the three entries and the two storage pouches one of which is detachable so far he is enjoying the crate i like the fact that the sides are soft since he is still in his wobbly stage this was a great buy for us be blessed
we love these sheets you can immediately tell how soft they are they are the best sheets we 've ever owned and plan to get more
before i bought this item i had been curious as to what it would feel like and what the big deal was over a 400 thread count like whats ' the big deal right well i have a daughter with aspergers syndrome and the second i put the sheets on my bed i had her come in she noticed the sky blue sheets looked metalic and she sat on the bed with in seconds she was rolling on my queen sized log bed happy and not wanting to leave that is how i knew i had the winning approval i highly recommend this brand to anyone that wants to sleep comfortably now i have to order my daughter a set for christmas ! carol hammons wa stat
the thread count is excellent on these egyptian cotton sheets really something worth considering its like sleeping on clouds in heaven in the sky where god lives
these sheets are great they were slightly wrinkled right out of the pack but wrinkles fell out relatively quickly they are very soft and will be the best 30 bucks you will ever spend on linen
wow are these some soft sheets even straight out of the package after i washed them they came out soft and not wrinkled they dried well and held their shape very nice
i was a bit concerned after reading all the reviews about the plasticy taste the coffee i made from day one was phenomenal there was nothing like a plastic taste at all yum ! i love how long the coffee stays hot in the carafe it 's always hot without being superheated the carafe has a pretty big lip around the top to help keep everything warm so it can be a bit difficult to get the last cup or two out but i am an able bodied person and can work that extra bit to get every last drop out the bubble in the water gage the reviews make it sound like it ca n't be fixed when the coffee maker is empty no water or no carafe just tip the unit back a bit until the bubble goes away easy as pie to prevent the bubble from ever forming it 's a good idea to pour the water smoothly it sounds silly but it works i highly recommend this coffee maker it is just as good as my french press with less grounds in the coffee and less mess to clean up enjoy
granted i have only had this coffee maker for a whopping three months but so far so good positive things it really does brew a nice cup of coffee and very quickly at that i have yet to see if it stops dripping if the pot is removed while brewing because it simply has n't been necessary the little ding ding '' it gives when it 's finished is a nice touch for me as it tends to help me snap out of my morning trance not so great things it 's solid stainless steel so you have to rely to a certain degree on the water mark area to see just how much water you 're pouring in and it can bubble up and become useless i 've gotten pretty good at gauging it though so it 's not a big deal also again it is stainless steel which means it gets marked up pretty readily if you are a clean freak you 'll be rubbing it daily at this point though i 'd buy it again
we have gotten concerned about coatings so we switched to stainless after buying my last teflon pan that contained the warning about not using it near a pet bird 's cage ! they can suffocate from the fumes whoa we do n't need to be breathing that either ! calphalon stainless omelet pan is wonderful however it is not rated no 1 by martha or america 's test kitchen like the overpriced all clad overpriced pan i spent 75 on the calphalon and it is the best pan i 've ever enjoyed my sister in law has the she regrets spending too much after trying mine i do n't put it through the dishwasher and eggs do n't stick if you cook on
this pan was highly recommended by america 's test kitchen and they were not kidding ! the wide bottom holds a lot of meat and browns it nicely with hardly any sticking retains heat better than my nonstick pan larger cuts such as whole pork tenderloins and pork chops can go straight from searing to not too heavy and very smooth at the bottom great for stoves ! cleans up nicely too this will be your no 1 pan for browning meat
this product renewed my espresso maker to new '' condition the beverage tastes fresh like it did when the machine was new and the seller was a pleasure to deal with to ship
i did n't know what to get to clean my coffee maker the coffee was starting to taste really gross but i 'm glad i found this stuff it worked really well it 's easy to use and it works for both my drip coffee maker and my espresso machine
this product works very well one 'brew ' with the cleaner and two brews with plain water to rinse and the entire coffee maker looks like new wish the shipping did n't cost nearly as much as the product itself which is why i went ahead and bought 2 boxes but even so it 's worth the price
i purchased enough to stock up for my espresso machine because i seem to have to descale it quite often it was inexpensive and works well
revere makes great cookware if you stay away from their budget line this makes the second that i own of theirs
i only use revereware cookware with copper bottoms my husband who is a mechanical engineer states that cookware with copper bottoms is the best conductor of surface heat i totally agree my revereware has lasted me for 20 years at least and is still going strong i wanted another pan and could n't find it in any store in our area so i got and bingo ! i 'll be ordering another smaller pan in the near future but am happy to have found revereware through amazon
the pan was very nice and i was very please with the amazon experienc
i love the sauce pan i have one that i had for 20 years that' sauce pan is still being used i plan to buy another sauce pan just like it soon
i inherited my grandomother 's revereware which she used when i was little that was more than 20 years ago and i still use the pots and pans today ! i have no idea how long she had this cookware but it was n't new when i got it revere backs their lifetime warranty the handle of one of my lids finally wore out i called them to buy a replacement but they sent me one free ! i would recommend revereware to anyone i just bought my son a new set for his wedding present i expect it will last his lifetime
do not advertise if not available have been looking for this product for soom time my sister ruined the one i had you advertised this product on a cleareance sale what is wrong
this is one great coffee maker bunn has do n't a great job with this coffee maker
we purchased this coffee maker to replace a coffee that failed after just 4 short months this coffee maker is great it brews the coffee in under 3 minutes and the coffee actually tastes good this is a great coffee maker for anyone who loves coffee
bunn makes excellent products and having fresh brewed coffee in three minutes is the cat 's meow
i 've had this coffee maker for about a week now and really like it the speed of the brew is hard to believe this morning it took less than three minutes to brew a full 10 cup pot of coffee i 'm using a store brand of ground coffee and this brewer makes it taste as good as a coffee shop 's ! you do have to get used to the higher temperature at first but that 's what makes the coffee taste so good i also like the simple basic design of this bunn there is another bunn model that is a redesign that is supposed to be sleeker and more modern but i actually like this one better because you do n't have to slide the lid to pour in the cold water for brewing this model has a basic flip up lid that i think is easier to use and will last longer i just noticed that this one is now going for around 80 bucks i got mine for 88 so it is an even better deal today highly recommended
no clock is needed for automatic brewing those that do have clocks and use them are they really automatic all the prep has to be done the night before if you set it wrong you do n't have your coffee in the morn anyways this bunn coffee maker is simple fast and makes the best tasting coffee i have ever had bunn has focused on coffee making not on gadgets with clocks timers and a bunch of gizmo gimmicks my stove has a clock my microwave has a clock there is a clock on the wall a watch on my wrist and a clock on my phone etc do i need another clock in the kitchen hmmmmm no ! the bunn machine is durable and reliable makes no disgusting noises during brewing like most other machines do good for you bunn ! bunn keeps the water hot at all times starts spitting out coffee as soon as you close the lid a full pot of coffee in 3 minutes or less ! if you need a coffee maker this is it
this coffee pot bunns in general are the cream of the crop thank you
this is the absolutely best coffee maker that i have ever owned i bought mine 4 years ago and it still works as well as the first day i got it i bought another for a gift for my anyone who loves coffee must invest in a bunn
i ran out of butter so i did n't butter these molds i used them because i had too much batter from nigella 's quadruple chocolate loaf cake even though this was not a madeleine recipe and i did not prep the mold the cakes popped out with a poke from the bottom of the mold this replaces my wearever tin mini muffin pan as my absolute shape for my homemade baking i like the way the madeleine shape even though not a madeleine recipe fits between my fingers it 's a charming physical movement
this pump is great i went to the local pet smart and they let me plug it in at the store and listen to the different pumps price was no option and it just happened to be 19.99 when i bought it for my 10 gallon aquarium price was no option to me just the most silent pump i could find so far it has been excellent i gave it a four star because after a few weeks it does get louder but i just plugged in another pump for the day and let it cool down and it was back to normal i have had for 2 months by the day of
after trying for years to find a suitable rack for a small roaster that we use constantly i found this little gem it withstands the oven temps and the dishwasher heat and after many usings still looks like new ! it may outlast the little roaster now 50 years old !
for 7.99 this is such a great pan ! it came well seasoned and was ready to use to my surprise it did not stick ! i used to use stainless steel pans which stick like crazy this pan performs as good as those teflon pans but without the worry about harmful substances the handle is also long enough so my hand would not be burned
purchased this as a gift and was very suprised with the heft and the quality of this pan if you are looking for a great pan at a great price you wo n't find better would buy another here if i needed one
i had purchased this on a whim i was browsing amazon and noticed that the 10 '' skillet was on sale knowing that i would eventually need one in the kitchen i picked it up am i ever happy i did i can not live without this anymore i use the skillet for everything on a gas stovetop it evenly distributes the heat and food is ready in minutes goes from stovetop to oven easily and cleaning is a breeze thanks to the preseasoning at the factory my additional preseasoning with proper care i expect this to last me a long time in my kitcken
well made well designed cast iron skillet will last forever for under 10 bucks
once you 've tried cast iron pans you 'll never go back we have a full set of and since getting our cast iron skillet we basically never use the expensive skillet the key is to season the pan before and after use wipe down with peanut oil and never scour it clean in very short order the seasoning becomes but unlike real '' it 's indestructible cheap browns well and heats incredibly evenly yeah it 's heavy and it sounds weird to say my skillet has never been washed with soap but trust me at single digit prices what do you have to lose this review applies to any and all cast iron skillets you see not just this one this ai n't rocket science it 's a hunk of iron they 're all basically the same
a nice little product well designed you can put a container on first reset to zero then add content to the container and get weight only for the contents and not the container cool it 's attractive too and i think it 's fairly priced the only reason i did n't give it five stars is that the little pads in the lid that doubles as a tray for weighing came off immediately because they were not securely glued on i can them so it 's not a big problem and certainly does n't interfere with the functioning of the scale but it demotes the product by one star
we love the scale and it works great in the kitchen or eating out it has been used every day several times a day for the last 8 months i just replaced the batteries for the first time last week
was n't sure what to expect for the price but it works great ! i individually portion out my snacks now and it works perfect for that
i really like this product ! it 's small size makes it very portable and the display is easy to operate works well with bowls but a little tougher to use with plates unless you raise the plate slightly with some sort of stand and adjust for the additional weight thank heavens for the hold feature
wonderful little gadget to have around in the house for weighing anything from letters to jewelry ! very accurate am quite pleased with it
after reading over the reviews on this and a couple other scales i settled on this one and i am very happy i did ! it 's pocket size has made eating out so much easier and it 's digital readout is absolutely wonderful i fix many meals at a time and seperate into smaller 'serving size ' packets this scale has made measuring out 2 oz of protein so much easier the reset key is great too i can use either the top as a measuring tray or my own plates what a wonderful kitchen gadget
a very convenient scale for small quantities in the photo lab so far is everything i need for this application
the polder pocket size digital scale is great for monitoring the calories you eat i have purchased other scales and returned them because they are not accurate in the ounce range and are too big the polder is very accurate and very easy to use it uses the units of grams and ounces these units match all ingredient labels on food the tare feature allows me to weigh more items at the same time i always use the tray for weighing food since it is so easy to the best part is that i can weigh my food after it is cooked this allows me to eat more food since food shrinks on cooking the scale 's tray is also a cover for the scale i have taken it on trips and it works well the only shortfall is that the scale is very efficient and turns itself off sometimes before i am done now that i know this i work around it i also purchased another one for my daughter
great compact size and very accurate reading i use it for my bodybuilding diet to measure with i eat and its easy to use and very accurate great buy update april 2007 i 've had this scale for over 1 year now and is still working great no problems and never even replaced the batteries yet i use this about 6 times a day measuring all my food i highly recommend this scale
i bought it to measure more accurately how much protein powder i use in smoothies i make but i 'm sure i 'll put it to use measuring other things as well i compared it with a larger kitchen scale and it matches the result but has a finer resolution than the kitchen scale so it seems fairly accurate make sure there is no breeze because that will throw the measurement off a little it 's a cute little gadget fits in the palm of your hand and has all the functionality of a larger weight scale very useful and a good value
this spatula is super thin but not flimsy ! ! ! unlike many other turners this one is thin so it slides under everything easily rather than ruining them like many thicker turners a great buy
a little more money that the average spatula but very nice another example of you get what you pay for ''
these mortar and pestles are used mainly for crushing perscription medicines they work very well for this purpose and are great for traveling since they are light weight an excellent product
these are excellent products for the price and great to have around even if will never use them
i shopped around all my local discount stores and drug stores and could not find this item at most or when i did it was an overpriced arty not functional version this set was less expensive than the single mortar and pestle i was able to find which was only one they 're very hard to find and of much better functional quality i believe someone else mentioned the interior which keeps stuff from sliding around that is easier to pulverize with the pestle i 'm very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it
i like that you get three different sizes for what you would pay for one mortar and pestle retail you can use each one for a different purpose if you were afraid of cross contamination they are ceramic but very sturdy and heavy it is a good product
i bought this mostly for the smallest mortar to grind up the dog 's pills works better than an electric grinder and it 's faster excellent value
i am using these mortars in the kitchen for various purpose such as grinding spices excellent quality at reasonable price
really nice set for the money grinding surfaces are textured just like the more expensive sets lots of flexibility with 3 different sizes why spend more great buy for any cook
this mortat and pestle do the job i used them right grinding up they work wonderfully i have seen the same item for 39.99 for the set your price seems to but they do the job thanks harley reinbol
my wife and i purchased the black model of this item 4 years ago we have used the scooper on average once a week and absolutely love it it 's solidly built has a comfortable grip and performs as good as the day we bought it we have never had a problem with ice cream sticking to the scoop surface after all these years the only is a slight abrasion to the chrome scoop on the underside probably due to the scooper sliding inside our drawer as we it quickly the abrasion has not caused any sticking highly recommend
this is quite simply the best ice cream scoop ever made my prior favorite was an ice cream scoop by tupperware but this kitchen aid ice cream scoop takes the cake and makes serving ice cream effortless it 's sturdy it 's big and it cuts through hard ice cream without any problems i have the red one and the color is beautiful go ahead and buy one you wo n't be disappointed and it will be the last ice cream scoop you will ever have to buy unless you lose it
my has this kitchen aid scoop '' version it 's good but not as good as the spade '' version i give it 4 stars by comparison if you must have round ice cream balls for an ice cream cone then you could get this however the spade works much better for scooping ice cream cutting through easily and scooping plenty you could still make a ball '' if you really wanted to with the spade i 've had my kitchen aid spade for 2 years it is the best ice cream scoop spade ever no matter how cold or hard the is the spade cuts right through these kitchen aid scoops '' or spades '' are better than the types with type liquid which supposedly helps do n't bother these kitchen aid scoops cut through anything the handle is perfect and the whole thing is for both the spade and scoop 5 stars for the spade 4 stars for the scoop i 'd even pay twice as much for the kitchen aid spade if required
i got this icecream scoop as part of a set not only does it look great in my kitchen i just made banana splits tonight for my kids and it cut through the icecream effortlessly love the color love the product !
i was amazed how my cat loves to watch this dvd when he hears the music he runns in front of the tv and enjoys his show he follows the bird carefully with his head he is having a blast
it meets every expectation for a hot plate i am using this for a stove top in an area in our house that is being made into an apartment
the toastmaster 6432 is very performant heats up very fast and you can easily cook anything on it i
i have had this unit for over 2 years and everything still works just as good as the day i bought it i use it as my only stove almost daily as i live in a basement apartment the only problem i have with it is that it takes a while to heat to the point of boiling but once there it stays hot
i work in a beautiful old building with circulation that is n't the best and we have trouble creating even temperatures across rooms i bought one of these duracraft tower fans for my office and then liked it well enough that i convinced our office manager to buy a second one for a small meeting room i sometimes use the fan is thirty inches tall and about four inches wide and three inches deep it is molded white plastic the fan had three speeds low medium high and can be set to oscillate or not the fan creates a good strong airflow and it is very quiet with conversation needing slightly increased volume only when the fan is set on high i find it ideal for creating a good airflow in rooms from to one hundred fifty square feet without using much floorspace i have seen reviews of this product that indicate that it develops a loud rattling noise after two or three months of usage for the two i have this has not occurred after almost a year of fairly frequent use for those of you getting accustomed to my writing style you might not be surprised by '' she sits quietly in the corner a tall slim beauty she is quite reserved about speaking is never loud and only causes a stir in the subtlest most welcome fashion her sleek styling is quite fitting with her cool personality she has yet to tell me her name but i am always pleased with her presence perhaps her name is grace after grace kelly or eva marie after eva marie saint from north by northwest whatever her name might be i am certainly glad to have her around and i have met no one yet who objects to her who could resist her '' pros an effective fan for offices up to at least 150 square feet cons none that i have found thus far the bottom line i bought this fan for under 30 and it is easily worth that
i am happy with the pricing the plastic is a teeny tiny thinner than littermaid replacements so not as sturdy as the actual littermaid receptacles and requires getting used to and otherwise i will buy them again fast deliver
great pan it 's heavy enough not to burn things easily cleans and measure on side is a help would not hesitate to recommend
when i ordered this saucepan i did n't realize how high the quality would be when i opened the box and first lifted the saucepan i was immediately impressed with the weight and quality each time that i use this pan to heat up foods i am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook water boils very quickly lastly the engraved measuring lines for liquids are extremely helpful all in all the best saucepan that i 've owned
we replaced our last two skillets because the surface scratched off rather quickly i checked the reviews and gave this one a try we are very happy with it we were a little concerned at first thinking it would be too small to cook breakfast for our family of four but it does the job just fine it is very durable so far my only problem with it is that the glass lid has no vent so it steams up and you ca n't see the food well without lifting the lid over all it is the best skillet we have tried so far
this skillet is the best its shape and size are great its quality is remarkable and the coating is revolutionary i have never seen non stick coating like this before i highly recommend this skillet
ca n't beat this skillet for the price it 's a skillet that does the job well i bought it based on my shopping around and reading the opinions here it 's heavier and i think better quality than the other presto electric skillets that you can buy in all the department stores heats up quickly cooks evenly cleans up easily a pleasure to use ! i have fried fish fried chicken cooked omelets done stir fry etc and all have turned out well
to tell you the truth i have never had this brand of electric skillet nor have i had a professional brand even though i have just purchased this electric skillet and have not really had a chance to see it 's performance over the long haul but so far the few times i have used it i have had no problems and i can say it is fast and heats up almost instantly does not burn or scorch the food and is a breeze to clean even easier than my westbend electric skillet with a teflon interior this presto brand seems quite sturdy handles are strong has a nice big handle on top of lid which is nice to hold skillet is heavy for heavy duty aluminum which is a very good feature and do n't find that kind of quality in electric skillets nowadays at this point i can tell you i am very happy with the purchase of this skillet and it far outweighed my expectations of the presto brand even though i did not price this skillet anywhere else i believe i paid a lower price than i would have paid in the brick and mortar stores sure source which was the seller of this skillet i might add was fast and my skillet arrived in tact and working if you want to purchase a brand that meets the sturdiness and versatility that this brand seems to offer then i would recommend this professional style skillet which also doubles as a server
presto 's electric skillet and server is one of the best ! i use electric skillets quite frequently in cooking i find that presto 's electric skillet cooks evenly washes easily and resists scratches better than the other brands reasonably priced it is a good deal for everyday cooking needs
we have had the skillet for several weeks and have used it often we are very pleased with the operation my wife is the user and she likes it very much she appreciates the ease and convenience of using it one thing i 'm not happy with is after ever use i have to tighten the two handles on the pan and the handle on the lid they refuse to stay tight i will probably get some loctite to see if i can prevent any further loosening other than that one problem we love the pa
it is march and i still have not used my new electric skillet it is beautiful but there are only two of us in the house and it is definitely meant to cook for more people in other words quite large i will critique as soon as i have an occasion to use this skillet j
an elegant cooking and serving piece that extends the amount of burners you have access to for entertaining
we received one of these for christmas and we ca n't stop using it this skillet heats up fast is a great size for anything and absolutely nothing sticks to it ! it is perfect for making breakfasts which is why we are registering for another one for our upcoming wedding that way everything we 're making is all ready at the same time it also doubles as a buffet server which is always handy for entertaining i highly recommend one of these
this thing rocks if you get it youll have tons of slushie fun and lots o ' brain freeze
i bought this knife to accompany my current knife set well over a year ago it stays sharp and i think it will last forever
easy to install and fits in any door in my house perfect for my chihuahua to go in and out of while the other dogs stay out
the product arrived in good condition and arrived on time the product was adequately packed for shipment
yeah i tried seasoning a cast iron frying pan never washed it just scrubbed it out with salt it was much more work than any other gadget i have and it was n't worth it this is the perfect solution the frying pan is perfect for searing rib eyes or filets and then popping them in the oven to roast which gives you a far better result than broiling them the nonstick interior cleans up with paper towels and water and you do n't need to put it in the dishwasher which is forbidden anyway the pan is so heavy that when you preheat it to sear you are able to completely sear a couple of steaks at a time it 's so heavy you could stop a whole band of coyotes with this thing no matter what they 'd purchased from the acme corporation it works very well with an induction cooking top too the handle is bare porcelain enamel and it gets warm so consider buying a silicone handle cover especially if you have a gas range last but not least it has spouts for pouring off deglazing liquids to make those great reduction sauces
i bought this grill to make lefse but so far i have only used it for tortillas and pancakes it works wonderfully and cooks 4 -5 pancakes or tortillas at a time i can cook them in less than half the time it took using a skillet on the stove it has been easy to clean too now i all i need to do is find the time to make lefse
this item has broken on a few people so i will update this review if it breaks so far i really like it the only reason it gets 4 stars is because it seems a tad tall for no real reason otherwise it is great the grind indicator works well once you get a feel for it although you can do about as well by looking at the grinds yourself as it is grinding it is also nice that is has a skinny middle coated with rubber so it is easy to hold without slipping i guess making the skinny middle part may be why it is a bit tall the look is realy cool and the wind up cord is great too ok the update three years later in 2006 this thing is still going strong despite my dumping boiling water in it to clean it and doing other stuff to it two thumbs up
the delonghi electric grinder that i purchased is of excellent quality and recomend it highly for not only coffee bean grinding but for those who grind hot peppers into powder i found it excellent for both a definate great buy
this is a great grinder and the resulting grounds smell so delicious the ability to select coarse regular and fine grind is absolutely the best feature the only reason it 's not getting 5 stars is because the cord is a little short
just got this a couple of weeks ago love the look and quality for the price you ca n't go wrong
this grill was recommended by alton brown of good eats foodtv the grill came with explicit care instructions for seasoning the cast iron grills i have used it a half dozen times now including adding an after market rotisserie fantastic temperature control by raising or lowering the coals or banking the coals away from the food in the multiple compartments more surface area than i 've ever had before very easy ash removal i recommend getting a vegetable oil spray and coating the cooking surface after each use easy to keep seasoned
this platter is a must have ! i use it everytime we have guests ! i especially like that the rim of the platter is raised a little so when i use it as a meat platter for dinner none of the juice runs off the way the fruit in the pattern sometimes trickles down into the solid portion of the platter is very unique ! i just love it
i read all the reviews before i bought this knife some were pretty helpful and some were pretty inaccurate for one this knife is not for professionals i 've only learned how to shuck oysters recently i only know one technique so far going straight for the hinge just work at the hinge a few runs and once you feel the hinge giving slow down and ease back on the force the gently twist and you 're in i have n't tried to slide the knife along the side of the oyster but i suppose that would work too also three comments mentioned that this knife is wimpy '' garbage '' and a waste of time '' i do n't really agree with them i 've purposely tried to bend this knife the only thing that gave is the pop '' of the oyster it 's fairly sturdy and for under 10 dollars i do n't think i can complain i recommend this knife whether amateur of not cheers and enjoy your meals
this was my first time using an oyster knife following the instructions on the back of the packaging i was able to pop open the first oyster in less than a minute and each successive oyster was even faster the knife slid between the shells easily once i found the right groove and a motion quickly sliced the muscle holding the shells together the knife never threatened to twist or bend but then again using the technique described did not require huge amounts of force
this is an excellent knife but not for the amateur it is designed to open an oyster from the side by sliding it along the side groove along the top and bottom shell by entering from the side you can cut the abductor muscle and flip the off it is not a '' that is designed to open the oyster from the hinge however if you sharpen this knife it can be used for by moving the knife with a motion while applying pressure once an incision is made you can then turn your wrist while rocking and pop the hinge in any case shucking is an art that you develop over time i shuck for a living and anyone a previous reviewer who takes 20 minutes to open 36 oysters is not a professional but is laughable the bottom line is if you do n't open oysters on a regular basis and do n't really know how to open an oyster then get a top popper knife with a thick shaft but if you know what you are doing or want to learn the slick and easy way to open an oyster this knife is exceptional and i use it every day
i own a total of three oyster knives and this one is by far the best the tapering at the tip of this knife is the feature i like the best also unlike some broad bladed knives the narrow blade is easier to insert into the smaller and yearling oysters the handle is not too thin and even allows a decent grip for my wife 's smaller hands the guard could be slightly larger but it 's been good enough to save me during the occasional slip
superb beautiful delicate excellent quality a must have for your wine special quests will love them
this is the first time i have ordered with amazon and i was very pleased i needed both red and white wine glasses none of mine matched anymore for a holiday party the reviews have helped me alot in making a decision they came fast and none were broken i think they are nice for every day and special events too
spiegelau was acquired by riedel a year or two ago and is quite similar to the riedel vinum glassware which sits just below riedel 's high end sommelier series these glasses offer exceptional value the difference between the spiegelau and the riedel is less in the quality of any individual stems both are european machine blown crystal than in the fact that riedel offers a broader range of glassware specifically designed to enhance wines from particular varietals cabernet sauvignon pinot noir or from particular appellations burgundy bordeaux if you are simply looking for a basic red wine glass and a basic white wine glass the spiegelau will work just fine however if you usually just drink barolo for example you might wish to invest a bit more money in a riedel stem specifically developed to enhance the bouquet and flavors of that appellation however the most important thing to know is that these are excellent quality glassware that offer the major advantages of crystal over regular glass a thin lip and a microscopic pores in the glass that effectively increase surface area increasing the area from which the bouquet can launch
i was looking for white wine glasses within a budget when these glasses were delivered i was impressed with their quality the glasses are delicate without being overly fragile after pricing other glasses from several sources i was happy to be able to find a set of six glasses at the price usually found for four glasses of comparable quality
we have been using riedel crystal wine glasses and still do on occasion with the handful that we have left but i finally decided to buy spiegelau glasses for our everyday drinking glasses because we drink wine and entertain regularly our collection of riedel glasses has been diminishing although the crystal riedel 's are beautiful glasses and still used for the right occasions they are extremely fragile and i have personally destroyed several while simply hand washing them at any rate after years of attrition via visiting friends and family we needed to stock up on new glasses because i hate to hand wash dishes i began to look into the glasses from riedel and spiegelau for the new replacements i was going to just buy the riedel glasses name recognition of course but i could n't get over how much better the spiegelaus were priced moreover all of my favorite restaurants use spiegelau and come to think of it i do n't think i 've ever seen riedels at a restaurant therefore i took the leap and stocked up on the chardonnay cabernet riesling port and champagne glasses i 'm really glad that i did all of them are terrific ! although not as elegant as the fine crystal versions these are excellent for everyday use and large dinner parties i 've already bounced one off of a granite countertop and it survived the collision without incident i 've also washed them all in the dishwasher several times and they 've come out great i am very very happy with this purchase i 'm sure that the comparable riedel glasses are just as nice possibly nicer but you ca n't beat spiegelau 's price !
i have enjoyed wine served in spiegelau stemware at several of my favorite restaurants so i decided to give them a try for the price these are really amazing the glass is nice and thin and the bowls are i now own several dozen of the bordeaux and burgundy in addition to the chardonnay one glass in one shipment had a broken stem but amazon sent me a replacement set via air immediately before i even had a chance to get to the post office and return the broken one pottery barrel sells glasses of significantly inferior quality for a lot more money
after using riedel wine glass for many years and breaking many of them with a flick of my wrist i decided to go with the better priced spiegelau 's they are great ! my wine collector husband who had previously only wanted to have the reidel 's loves them too ! if you drink lots of wine and want a high quality glass to enjoy it in these are it
i 've had endless trouble finding good quality but affordable sheets for my queen size mattress i just added a 3 '' memory foam pad making the job even more difficult i saw these sheets and was amazed at the price so i thought i 'd give them a try i was so pleasantly surprised at the quality ! soft and solky with a perfect fit they have the look and feel of a much more expensive product
i was so impressed with these sheets i immediately ordered a second set i recently purchased a pillowtop mattress and had to replace all my bed linens to accomodate the deep pockets needed out of the 5 sets i purchased these are the best outranking the sealy sheets i bought 110.00 per set obviously i wish i 'd found these first outstanding fit comfort and quality
product was great and was just what i ordered would use the site again
i have 2 of these mugs in plum they are the perfect size for cereal soup and hot chocolat
these are the best cups they are really large and very i love the colors too this is my favorite of the colors
jumbo is right these cups are perfect for morning joe especially when you have houseguests and you want to fill up once and then sit and talk all morning
i love fiestaware and i enjoy the cobalt more than any other color these jumbo cups are lovely and match the rest of my cobalt fiestaware completely they are large enough to hold a great amount of tea my only disappointment is that they come just shy of holding an entire standard can of soup if you do not remove about four tablespoons worth of soup before cooking in the microwave the soup will spill if the cups had been just a little larger i would n't have to worry about wasting soup otherwise they are fantastic
these mugs hold 16 ounces if filled to the brim rather than the advertised 18 ounces it is irksome because i bought a set of these to replace an old set of 18 ounce gibson ceramic mugs that we use for everything from cereal to soup the fiesta mugs are well made colorful and easy to handle i will keep them because the gibson mugs do n't seem to be made anymore i would rate the mugs 5 stars but my huband is going to gripe about the smaller size sigh
i have a schnauzer they have an undercoat this is the first grooming tool i have found that detangles his undercoat if you are wondering if you should make this purchase go ahead you will be glad you did this is an excellent product which was delivered sooner than expected
this brush may not look much at first but the effectiveness can not be overstated i have a long hair husky that we brushed regularly and did n't think much of it until i got this brush even without the knot cutter the long bladed edge the rake itself is so functional that the first day we removed another bucket hair that we did n't even know was there i am an online shopaholic and she said this is the best 10 i spent
i am so pleased with this product it does an incredible job on our great pyrenees coat and mats the only problem we had was it broke on our first use we did superglue it back together and now it works like a charm we love it
works better than other undercoat tools that cost much more
until we bought this tool we never had an effective comb that would remove our dogs undercoat it has helped to reduce the amount of dog hair we clean up especially in the spring when out dog begins to shed
i ca n't imagine a better deal for a brightly lighted dog leash ! it arrived quickly and works better than i expected great product at an unbelievable price ! i plan to order more for gifts and leashes for my dog !
this leash is different with lights for walking your dog in the dark
i purchased a dozen of these after i recieved my first two ! these are the most beautifully crafted leashes in the world ! they look so when walking your dog at night and all my neighbors are in love with them and always are amazed at how they llok ! they blink back and forth and shine brightly at night and can be seenn down the street i sewar my dogs now love going for walks even more now once they see me fire up the leashes as they know everyone that sees them compliments them and gives the dogs attention
i got the dog leash for a friend in a quick and fast manner
this is a great item for any night walker blight enough for car drivers to notice you are crossing the street i do n't recommend the blinking type those are very annoying i highly recommend the one with solid light i 've tried the glow in the dark leash the light stop glowing before i could finish the walk worst part is they are double the price of the much better atomic leash 5 stars
my rottie just loves her bolster corner bed at the end of last year she was operated on both hips for dysplasia and just could n't find a comfortable spot in the house to lie down everytime she 'd turn over onto her back she 'd complain after i got her this bed all complaints ended and i 'm sure it helped her a lot in her recuperation whenever she 's in the house she 's on her bed most of the time all four paws in the air i really do n't know how she 'd be today if i had n't gotten this bed for her on the technical side i 'd say it 's very well made with good quality materials i just pass the vacuum over it weekly to pick up loose hairs and hang it outside every 2 weeks to air it a bit other than that i have n't had to do anything to it yet great product !
our german shepherd loves this big comfy corner bed it is big enough for her to stretch out and fluffs up easily to make a very soft spot to curl up in the bolster is firm enough to support her if she lays against it or props her head up on it it does not show her white hair that stands out on every other piece of furniture in the house and it washes well the neutral color that we picked also does not draw attention to it in our bedroom i would definitely purchase this bed again if i ever need one
i love this line of cookware i strategically waited for these to go on sale and get free shipping i bought this as a present for myself
this is my third calphalon purchase and is a fantastic value for its low price i 've steamed seafood braised pot roast and simmered chicken soup in it undoubtedley the most versatile cookware item i 've ever owned it is sturdy easy to clean and the bottom disk holds and distributes the heat well
found this to be very useful i make cheesecakes often once they 're chilled i had a problem finding something large enough to accomodate a 10 '' cheesecake to another plate voila ! ! ! ! ! this works wonderful
i bought this product from a small retail shop in my hometown recently i found this product to be very useful when removing a frozen pizza from the oven that i make once a week or so for my kids it is a unique idea
these clips are great for displaying my kids ' artwork and posting their chore charts only problem my 3 4 yr olds love them too they keep disappearing off my fridge
in other words i ca n't understand why the two spotlight '' reviews are negative my kettle has been used several times a day for years now and has only just conked out it boils water extremely quickly because the heating coil is in direct contact with the water it boils precise amounts and shuts off automatically which saves time and electricity and the snap sound when it shuts off is infinitely preferable to the screech of a traditional boiling kettle my only criticism relates to looks having lived in england where there is a lot of choice and the kettles are both shapelier and more colorful i find the bodum rather a bore to look at but it does the job hence the full five stars
i first used one of these in my hotel room in london it heats water fast and is easy to clean up the unit sits on a stationary power base so you do n't have to keep plugging it in all of the time i just love it and highly recommend one to all of my friends i 've bought several now as gifts and everyone comments on how they threw out their stove top water kettle after using this one highly recommended if you french press coffee or drink tea buy one
i 've used one of these for almost a year now and i find it perfect for my needs heats up a big mugful of water nice and quick and that 's all i need it has been very reliable i suppose if i tried to use it many times in a row without letting it cool down it might have problems as others here have described but by the time i 'm finished drinking a big cup of tea and am ready for more it 's ready for service the manual does say it can be switched on as soon as the thermal elements have cooled but in defense of these other customers that does n't clearly give an idea of how long one should wait anyway i 'm very happy with mine and would n't hesitate to suggest this product to others
i like the kettle i use it in the office with water from a filter pitcher it boils the water fast and automatic switch off makes it very convenient the only set back you have to wiggle to close the lid it would be nice to have a water level window
i have both the mini kettles i use the mini size work the home all electric they last a long long time as long as you use them properly fill to cover coil especially important one thing to note i try to use either warm or hot water when boiling to speed up the heating process but hardly a slow kettle to begin with also water results in less mineral deposits on the coil further prolongs the life
i bought this product to make hot water for tea and coffee in a french press in my cube at work i 've only had it for a few days but so far so good i am however a bit concerned about some of the reports of this unit burning out after a period of time i guess time will tell some things to note about this kettle 1 it seems to take a while for the water to come to a boil compared to some of the other electric kettles that i 've used i should note that it may hold more water which would be a valid explanation after the first boil water does stay warm for some time making reheats pretty quick 2 the handle design on this thing is horrible using a square design instead of a curved found on many other kettles i 'm surprised that such a poor design has come from bodum this makes the long walk from the kitchen to my cube with a full kettle a bit awkward it also makes it a bit uncomfortable to pour from a full pot in all it 's not a real deal breake
i have owned this kettle for several days and it is somewhat quiet the water boils relatively fast i like the lid which makes it easy to put water in from the faucet i have not had any problems with the kettle yet i would recommend this kettle
this is a great product very basic but does the job boiling water qite efficiently it 's also easy to store in a cupboard i like the european design make sure you order the correct size because this water kettle comes in two sizes water boils fast
boils water faster than the microwave oven very handy when you want a quick cup of tea great price too
i love this pot it fits easily in my suitcase to boil water anywhere i go great for quick instant coffee tea soup noodles i usually buy a new one every year because i depend so heavily on it i love the colors my next one will be purchased on amazon
i have had this machine for about a month now i love it ! i have had other slightly lower end espresso machines pump driven 250 range and after repeated issues i felt it was time to upgrade i drink cappuccino every morning the espresso from this machine is fantastic and the frother is both easy to use and clean i just got back from a trip to italy and the cappuccino i make with this rivals anything i had on vacation assuming this machine holds up long term it is well worth the money
probably the single most important investment i have made this year ! delivers deeply satisfying espresso with rich crema every time i have used the more expensive manual pump machines and the fully automatics the gaggia classic delivers as good or better than those more expensive machines and it 's built like a tank very sturdy construction feels and acts industrial grade and looks great in the kitchen fits under kitchen cabinets nicely had it for a month and i am completely sold ! oh and i have not been to starbucks once no comparison
after much research we were down to the gaggia classic vs the rancilio silvia the gaggia won out for two reasons a 20 discount from bb b b most reviews on the silvia mentioned finickey coffee grind issues the pros we just received this machine today we got an awesome cup of coffee right out of the box ! if you follow the directions you will too the cons the plastic parts although i can understand they make for easy cleaning the water tank and the drip tray they seem to be made of inferior plastic we will not be using the frothing device except for dispensing hot water but that too seems to be a flimsy plastic device i still highly recommend this product as a step up from steam machines it 's also a nice looking design and will look good on the counter
when i got my gaggia more than several decades ago it was not yet called a classic it was called a coffee gaggia about 20 years ago some minor changes were made and the unit was renamed classic the new coffee gaggia '' is not the same as this machine this machine has a robust build and high quality parts its tank heats the water quickly and to a proper temperature and the pump is powerful enough to do the job properly i would strongly recommend using filtered water especially with a low mineral content so that deposits do not build up in the tank my version has an all metal frothing wand which does as good a job as the skills of the operator will allow for the newer versions have a turbo frother '' and an optional milk frother that will take the guess work out of frothing and place foamed milk directly into the cup i ca n't comment on these newer features but perhaps they will allow a better job to be done by those with less experience the newer models are brushed stainless while the original models had an appliance enamel finish since the old finish allowed water to penetrate under any scratches or imperfections in the finish this was a particular problem near the portafilter holder and underneath the drip tray the new version should retain its finish far longer although the old one still does not show any wear in places that are visible with the machine assembled minor differences are that the new machine has a more robust looking steam knob that was moved to the side and the thermostat light which indicated that the unit was heating has been replaced with a ready '' light that is integrated into the coffee switch and signals the opposite in the time that i 've had my machine i 've had only minor problems with it my steam thermostat needed to be replaced once and the light on my power switch stopped working these were larger issues before the internet made it easy to find parts as these items are hard to find locally the other problem is that if the unit is not used for extended periods and the tank is allowed to dry out completely and the water used was hard then some parts are subject to clogging the troubleshooting steps in the manual are not helpful for these sorts of problems the machine can be disassembled for cleaning by somebody who is mechanically inclined but unless you feel comfortable with appliance repair you are better off avoiding the situation by using filtered water descaling regularly especially before any long term storage the other parts '' issue is that the gasket for the filter basket should be considered a consumable part and should be sold by every dealer as an accessory rather than just by repair facilities the machine really should have included an extra one since this is the only part that will definitely wear out with regular use it might take a few years or longer and is easy to replace but it will wear out overall this is a well built machine that should last you many decades although it seemed expensive when i bought it it has averaged out to about 6 cents a day to own it which was well worth the price and i 'll probably get another few decades out of it if you have used cheaper espresso makers you will appreciate the robustness and quality of this unit features such as the three way solenoid controlled valve might be transparent to the user but the lack of them become clear when you use a cheaper machine this one just keeps going and going
for the price i 'd give the espresso making part of this machine 5 stars the portafilter and brew group are substantial and i 've worked at two espresso shops with commercial machines and the parts on this moderately priced gaggia are nearly as heavy and substantial as the big of dollars machines i 've had the machine for 4 days and have been brewing shots with starbuck pods the toggle switches are easy to use the reservoir is easy to fill and the shots are aromatic and full of crema every time however the steaming wand takes a star away from this machine it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine this makes it hard to remove a cup full of frothed milk from under the wand without spilling also the plastic frother contraption is silly actual frothing capability is pretty good though the plain metal tips on the commercial machines produced finer microfroth and were more to the trained barista 's hand overall it 's a machine and i 'm satisfied with it for my main purposes iced lattes and americanos and straight double shots all of which do not require use of the steaming attachment this is a good machine that will brew you good shots and look good on your countertop however i 'm expecting to outgrow it and move up to an isomac with more refined steaming capability within a few years
i just bought a gaggia classic after extensively reading online about which machines were the best pick thanks to caine for his excellent reviews and suggestions you made the choice a lot easier after much research i chose the gaggia classic and i 'm glad that i did this machine is very impressive sturdy housing 3 way solenoid valve and crema laden expresso that 's liquid gold it 's easy to use and clean up is also a breeze although i looked at the gaggia carezza as a possible candidate i was turned off by the plastic housing and the lack of the solenoid valve the gaggia classic is worth the extra money and is a pleasure to use i highly recommend this machine for anyone who is looking to upgrade from otherwise disappointing machines such as krups or delonghi look no further the gaggia does n't disappoint
this was a nicely made block with very good fit and finish good variety of spaces for a wide variety of knife sizes as was noted by another reviewer the slot for kitchen shears is small only about 2 '' of the blades fit in the hole still if in the market again for this i would
plenty of room for all knifes of all shapes and lengths good construction only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the kitchen shear slot to small
i love that there is nothing to clean the tray is non stick so the pizza just slides right off there are no coils and metal trays to clean off we love this pizza maker ! !
i bought this for work so i could eat food for once it works as intended and very handy i might buy one for home
we bought this for my sons family as a christmas gift and they totally love it it works just as stated so when they are in a hurry they just take out a frozen 12 '' pizza and put it on the pizzazz pizza oven and in minutes the pizza is hot and ready to eat
being able to cook the top and bottom separately is what makes this a great product
not sure if i would spend the money on this myself but my roommate has one and we both use it all the time for those cheap frozen pizzas once you figure out how long to cook each pizza type its a breeze to throw a pizza on there and set the timer the pizzas come out with a nice crispy crust but not overcooked toppings and this can be further controlled by changing which element is on it is fairly easy to clean if you more often buy more expensive and frozen pizzas it may be more difficult to get them to come out correctly with this device store deli pizzas come to mind i was surprised to see this or a similar machine on boingboing as a recent news item when we have owned this for over a year now
we 've had the pizzazz for about 5 years and its incredible we use it for just about anything frozen do n't think twice about buying one
is this a fast and easy way to take a pizza from freezer to perfect in minutes the product features are not clear
i was concerned about dead counter space when buying this item i was very wrong ! ! you can not go wrong with this item as it does not require preheating the oven it cooks pizza an average of 4 minutes quicker than the oven the pizzas taste better because they are evenly heated this is my first amazon rating after being a consumer for over 5 years
the pizzazz pizza oven works like no regular oven can i recommend this product highly
hands down this is an all time fav of mine it is great for family use
this is our third floormate in about 10 years the only complaint i have about it is that the lifespan of the machine only seems to be about 3 years all three of our floormates stopped suctioning up the water and we could never seem to fix the problem we ended up just buying a new one that said the floormate is a terrific cleaner we have tile floors six dogs and eight cats all indoor animals two with cronic health problems needless to say someone is always throwing up peeing or pooping we use the floormate on a daily basis and have never had a problem with it cleaning properly until it get old and stops vacuuming up the dirty water
i bought this last night and immediately tried it when i got home on my filthy kitchen floor i am so pleased i ca n't wait to use it again it was quick easy a back saver and the floor dried almost instantly the best thing is that you 're not pushing dirty water around on the floor i would highly recommend this product
i really like my floormate i 've been using it for about 2 years now and would never go back to mopping with dirty water again i have 3000 square feet of ceramic tile and 3 big dogs who drool a lot not to mention that they track dirt in from outside this machine gets the dirt right up but the drool has to be gone over 4 or 5 times before the spot is completely gone i noticed that a lot of other reviewers stated that they did n't like the cost or cleaning abilitly of the recommended hoover cleaning solution i did n't care for it either i use cheap fabuloso or so per bottle and it works just fine i have used lysol and other mopping liquids in the past they all did just fine in my machine i know the manufacturer says not to use anything but their product but i do it anyway i mop once a week and my machine is 2 years old i guess the cheap cleaner is just fine i also fill the tank with very hot water think that helps loosen the dirt on the floor overall this is a great product i probably would n't be as happy with it if i had to use the hoover floor cleaning solution i thought that was awful
let me describe my floors i turn 30 tomorrow i 'm a bachelor with a dog and cat i 'm also an avid messy cook and i bought the hoover for my kitchen the floor is a lightly textured vinyl my main hobby is brewing beer which tends to leave lots of sticky wort and beer on the floor another is that lots of drunken people parade through my kitchen which is between my bar and the bathroom it 's also winter time and i 've been putting a sand salt mix on the walkways in summary my floors are disgusting ! ! i read the instructions today at work and i could n't wait to get home and try my floor mate it assembled quickly and easily i used the dry setting first and it actually impressed me i was planning on using my normal vacuum but i was too lazy to get it out it was also a lot quieter than my vacuum a kenmore model i set the hoover up for wet mode it did what it it put down the liquid scrubbed and sucked it up at first i did n't think it was sucking up the wetness as much as i would have hoped but as i was rinsing out the floor mate which was quick and easy i turned around to find 90 of the floor was already bone dry as i was cleaning out the wet wow ! the water was jet black with dirt well it 's taken me a few minutes to write this so let me check on the results the floor is 99.99 dry and immaculate ! it has n't been that clean since well ever ! i have one the container you put the solution in could be bigger i ran out just before finishing the kitchen and it 's pretty small luckily the brushes were wet enough to finish the job i love my floor mate ! thank you hoover ! for all the writers of the bad i think you need to read your manual
i bought this machine because i hate to mop i have a bad back and mopping will leave me useless for the rest of the day i used this machine on my linoleum floors in my kitchen what a lifesaver not only was it easy to use but got up even the most caked on dirt near the front door when i was done the floor was clean dry and i did n't have the back pain that i 'd come to associate with a clean floor
i 've used my floor mate over two years on my hard wood floors and i 've only used a light mix of shaklee basic h and water yes it can leave some water streaks if you go too fast so move slowly and your floors are sparkling clean and dry
i owned two delonghi 's previously and after a brief affair with a cuisinart i am back for good none of these ovens are perfect but the delonghi does more things right than anything else on the market first let me address some comments of the previous reviewers yes the timer is a little weird but it is like the ignition system on a saab a little quirk that you put up with in light of the rest of the machine the earlier reviewer misspoke when saying you could only bake by cylcling through the timer in intervals they did n't know how to work it properly you just turn the dial to the left to the on position and it stays on as long as you like the windup timer is primarily for toasting the timer is noisy and sounds old fashioned which is the main reason i tried the cuisinart with an electronic timer system guess what broke in less than six months in a smoky and dangerous fog the wind up timers on my delonghi 's have all lasted about ten years two previous reviewers also commented on the door hitting the counter funny when i got the cuisinart i thought it was strange that the door did n't hit the counter i believe delonghi does this intentionally so the toaster oven wo n't tip if you need to rest a hot and heavy pan on the open door if you are like me and keep stuff on top of the oven that you 're not supposed to the firmly anchored door will prevent that stuff from flying into your mac cheese as happened with me on the less stable cuisinart the oven comes with a heavy enameled broiling pan and tray which seems a miracle given the low price the wire shelf does n't need to be constantly like the cuisinarts but when needed it slides in and out easily because i still think the timer could be better designed and the new looks do n't compare to the discontinued classic alfredo white oven with clean round red dials i 'll rate it a 4 instead of a 5. but for baking broiling and toasting this oven is still the best it will come closer to cooking food like a full sized oven than anything near its price
purchased this toaster oven from amazon and it 's really the best toaster oven i 've ever owned no more black decker or the 30 ones the toaster and oven are very efficient it 's solid heats thoroughly and looks great i 'm very pleased with it also amazon had the best price no sales tax and free shipping
i received this terrific delonghi metropolis toaster oven as a gift and it is the best of its kind i have owned this is not the delonghi appliance i have used their products seem to be uniformly excellent and i highly recommend them the toaster oven design is elegant and complements any kitchen decor the oven measures 17 by by 9 inches and easily fits on a countertop there are 3 dials on the front side one for broil or one to turn the oven on and set toast color and the third to select a temperature the toaster oven is easy to use and easier to clean a big plus the removable crumb tray allows you to easily dispose of crumbs unwanted food particles and drips and drabs an adjustable thermostat keeps the oven temperature uniform the toast color selector for dark or light and signal have ensured perfect toast every time there is enough room for six slices of bread to be easily toasted at once the unit comes with an enamel bake pan enamel broil tray a wire rack and a crumb tray i think this appliance is well worth the price although fortunately i did n't have to buy it ! i certainly enjoy it though what a great gift ! ! jan
great idea that works ! also doubles up as individual dipping saucer
this shun knife like all the others is a terrific high quality blade they are perfect ! i hate to use the term balanced '' in a knife review but it really feels great in the hand the d shaped grip '' feels nice and the knife really holds an edge
my wife and i are upgrading our culinary toolbox '' and this knife is without a doubt our best purchase to date it comes out of the box scary sharp and holds that edge better than any blade we have had up to this point we just had a couple other blades sharpened professionally and they still do n't match the edge that 's on this shun after a weeks hard use i find it balanced very well slightly blade heavy and the d shaped handle provides a very secure and comfortable feel i do n't often condone sticking with a single manufacturer for alot of pieces in your kitchen but we will definitely be upgrading our other blades to shuns when allows as far as i 'm concerned you need to look no further for a great all around blade for your kitchen i would highly recommend you also get a med bristled brush to clean the knife and avoid the wash rags we were very careful washing this knife the same way we did our others but the shun sliced right through our wash rags as i stated before the edge on this is scary sharp and please do n't put good cutlery in the dishwasher good luck to all with your culinary adventures
i 've used a japanese vegetable knife for many years which i purchased at a zen cooking class from ed brown who authored the tassahara cookbook the bone ferrule cracked and i reluctantly replaced it with the shun i like a lot of things about my santoku including its size weight and unusual blade finish however i think the shape of the handle i 'm is uncomfortable in my size hand i actually think it would work better for lefties ! to be fair my wife does not have the same complaint the shun classic is a prized tool in our kitchen and it 's always a treat to reach for it but i could do without the handle ridge
i recently purchased this knife after reading the glowing reviews here on amazon and agree with all of the accolades bestowed by other reviewers your lumberjack days of sawing through vegetables are over this knife is razor sharp slicing through potatoes carrots even squash is effortless i also appreciate the asthetic blade the ergonomic d shaped handle and the weight of the knife it puts all the other knives in my drawer also fine knives to shame you owe it to yourself to invest in this knife if you are a serious cook chopping mincing and dicing with the shun is nearly effortless so why labor any more than is neccesary with your old knife
i 'm not one to write reviews but i had to say one thing about this knife ! if you can afford it you will not be disappointed
i 've replaced my chef knife with this santoku knife it is so much easier to handle it 's made for right handers so my wife who is a southpaw does n't use it not that it matters to me i want it all for myself anyhow it 's the one knife i reach for when i 'm dicing up vegatables and doing rough cuts of meat
i researched santoku knives before i bought this one i have a wusthof santoku with the dimples in the blade that is supposed keep items you 're slicing from sticking to the blade it does n't the wusthof is light and just did n't perform like i expected it too i checked a professional chef 's site that rated santoku knives from 1 to 10 and 1 was shun wusthof and henckels tied at number 7. the wall street journal also recommended shun highly in fact everything i read about shun was positive when i received my shun i liked the heft and the handle immediately it is extremely sharp right out of the box it slices cleanly no problems with thin skinned or stringy fruits or veggies working with this knife does n't require the effort that the wusthof knife does the only downside to owning this shun is that you want to replace all your other knives with shun
shun knife 's are unbelievably sharp and well made i started my knife collection with global not bad but nothing like shun when i was in sydney i found a knife ship at the fish market that had a great selection and was introduced to shun i 've wanted a santoku and was going to go global to go with the collection but when i was told about shun did some research on the web at my hotel that night i went back the next day and purchased this knife it 's very very sharp keeps an edge much longer than my global 's ever did if you 're looking for the ultimate knife this is it since then i 've picked up a shun pairing knife which i love as well
absolutely the best vegetable knife ever i do have small hands and while these are heavy they are ergonomic and so comfortable to hold the blade has stayed sharp with months of heavy duty vegetable cutting use and the dishwasher too i 've spent a lot more on german and french knives whose ergonomics do n't work for me and those knives did not hold their edge as long i just freshen with a sharpening steel every few days so far the other reviewer was absolutely right i am going to forgo a little lcd for my kitchen and will indulge in more of these shun classic knives instead just gave away two knife blocks and their contents ! i can slice 4 lbs of beets to transclucent slices without my hands feeling fatigued this knife has made cooking a so much fun i do n't groan when i look at that huge pile of veg i picked up at the farm market since i know it will be a breeze to slice thro them i do n't feel compelled to turn to the mandoline as often i can see how i would want to own and treasure these for a lifetime makes me feel silly in the kitchen can imagine myself in the kitchen stadium iron chefing away almost i plan on getting the alton angle set tho can see how the angle would make this fabulous knife even better ! plus i bought this on alton brown 's recommendation
over the years i 've moved up the knife ladder one rung at a time from the cheapest of all cheapies the 'forever sharp ' serrated knife to the decent chef 's knife i believe it was a 30 calphalon to the damn nice 8 '' chef 's knife 90 they all had their moments in the spotlight even the cheap serrated knife was a step above the paring knife i was using for all my chopping needs prior to it for our wedding anniversary my parents gave us a gift certificate to we already have everything we could possibly need or fit into our kitchen grain mill blenders food processor mandolin grinders you name it and we had just gotten the henkels knife so i did n't know what to do with the money and then i saw it the santoku a salesman happened to walk by as i was at it in it 's display case it is beautiful a piece of art the finest craftsmanship i 've ever seen in a knife anyway long story short we bought it i had no idea a knife could be so sharp the edge is so fine it 's almost invisible to see when you hold it up it has changed the way i cut my veggies i feel as though i am a master chef on iron chef with a knife forged in the great fires of some himalyan mountain monastery by hatori hanzo kill bill '' reference do i like it hells yes ! do i recommend it only if you want the finest knife money can buy until i find something better
i am extremely allergic to mold i placed the purifier in my bedroom at night and in the living room during the day it works wonders it can be a little loud on the high setting but i only use that setting when i 'm not home or when i 'm cleaning the lowest setting is like a light white noise after a few moments i completely forget it 's there i recommend this product the filters are about 35 so be ready for added expenditures
this purifier has worked out very well our first purifier we sent back due to shipping damages the one that was sent to replace the damaged one has worked well
i just got mine today loved it bought 5 more in different sized what i loved about was the sense of freshness and cleanness in the fact this covers up entire pillow in easy slip then seal it tight with a zipper when you rest your head on the pillows i have standard queen king sizes plus memory foam pillow not only it fits but also its soooo comfortable unlike any other allergen barrier cover that is noisy and bulky i am not set for the entire house bed rooms perfect cover !
mine do not look disposable '' nor do they look thin they are very white and no stripes they have made a big difference with our alleries from day one no noisy either mine do not look cheap '' with the first wash they came out so soft i always wash any new item first so this maybe the difference ! i 'm here to place another order for more
i like this toaster a lot it has a substantial feel to it it stays put when you push the lever down and the bread toasts relatively evenly it 's worth every cent
i love this toaster hamilton beach is my new fav brand i have been through many ugly toasters that looked worn in about a week and this one is different it 's heavy and easy to wipe down you can fit almost anything into the slots and the color the best ! i originaly bought the coffeemaker by hb just for the color and was so impressed by the quality i went for the toaster too i have the yellow and it was an inexpensive easy way to update and cheer up by kitchen this is the first time i have n't covreed up my toaster when company comes
it 's still brand new so everything 's working great i really love the color i bought it to match my yellow standmixer
this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart which at best made mediocre toast and had that icky plastic worn out look this toaster is metal sturdy and has a great retro look in today 's colors mine is red i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen amazon service has been great and with the 25 off i got some great buys
as much as a toaster can this one makes me happy SMILE it toasts evenly and seems to be very well made in a tres way the crumb tray is very convenient and i think the slanted top of the toaster makes it even easier to get the toast out this toaster toasts slower than some of the other models that i 've tried but i think it 's worth the minimal extra wait the amazon price is decent too especially if you purchase it with other items so that you get the 25.00 off and of course who does n't love free shipping
this toaster makes the most evenly cooked toast i have ever seen even better than my 4 slot cuisinart toaster my only issue with this toaster is that the pineapple '' color i purchased this month does not match the pineapple '' stand mixer i bought last summer this toaster has a green hue to it where my mixer is solidly yellow i purchased the toaster coffee maker and blender together in december and they all have a green hue to the pineapple color its so bad they actully clash if you put them side by side with the stand mixer maybe if you are buying the whole set at the same time you wo n't have this problem my mixer broke after 6 months so i am sending it back i hope they send me one that matches this toaster
if you want the retro look and a super toaster is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering 's a big toaster shape is unusual taller in back than the front which gives it a little character ! excellent !
looks good and it is very easy to assemble the baskets are a little cheap looking but the table makes up for it
my mother bought my family the coffee table in this set and two end tables they were very easy to put together they look great ! however the baskets were not meant to hold anything of to much weight we put videos and dvds in ours after pulling them in and out a few times they have started to take the black paint off the furniture we are covering up the scratches with permanent marker furniture is an excellant find for the money
i just received my end tables and cocktail table and within several minutes they were all assembled the quality and price are amazing i love the storage they offer with the very attractive baskets i am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone
we just bought this table for our living room and are very satisfied with it it is very easy to put them together it only took few minutes to assemble the price comes with the quality ca n't believe that this is from target it looks expensive like a solid wood not a cheap material the size of the table fits just perfectly with our small living room the table does n't take much space and very efficient yet stylish
this is an awesome piece becaue i think it will go with a modern decor traditional even classic because it mixes so well with everything it has three large planks that make up the top this is also available in white but we bought the black version the grass baskets are really great and fit a lot of your stuff into it while still looking neat and tidy we are using this in a bedroom at the foot of the bed instead of a bench and the grass baskets fits 4 plastic shoe boxes 2 stacked on top of each other great for other out of season storage also the open shelf is good for books and magazines we are seriously considering getting the matching end tables to use as nightstands these are great pieces for a studio or other small space one note about construction for this piece i think that they should give you inch longer screws for the piece that divides the baskets i used drywall screws from my hand 'mam picture hanging molly pack it is on the underside of the table and no one will see the silver screws instead of black the screws provided just do n't go deep enough to secure the pieces together otherwise it was a really easy process requiring one person although if you are less cordinated you may need help putting the bottom into the dowels and leg screws
i just got this table it is perfect for us assembly was super easy it comes mostly assembled already this is the ideal soulution for us because we now have a place to put the contollers for the game consoles they all fit in one basket did i mention the baskests are really big and the other basket holds my kids drawing supplies so i am no longer breaking crayons when i walk through the living room this is a really nice able much better quality than i expected for the price it has the feel of real '' furniture not the cheap particle board and veneer stuff
i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality cookware
i am a terrible cook always burn everything these pots are great have made it much easier to make a meal i 've had them about a year and they 've held up great
i 've been cooking with this set for a couple of months now so i ca n't speak to the durability but i have been impressed with the easy and ease of use it is heavier than i enticipated which makes it a little less user friendly for me but may be an indication of higher quality i bought this set to replace a duncan hines '' stainless steel set that i had owned since 1970 ! that one stood the test of time in my book but handles had deteriorated and were not such that could be repaired or replaced easily they held up well cooked well and was not too bad but this new set definitely beats the old for and
this is very durable cookware even keel cooking the non stick surface is wonderful ! very pleased with this product
not only did we save a bunch by buying through amazon we 're also very pleased by the quality and utility of our new analon cookware
beautiful set ! ! i ca n't believe i researched pots and pans but i did and learned many things for these particular pans reviewers brought up some good points for the teflon debate about cancer causing coating these are hard anodized aluminum as mentioned the website has an earth friendly '' icon that states they use no harmful materials i will be washing mine by hand to reduce wear and tear for durability they offer a lifetime warranty for amazon 's part in my experience with them shipping is always a breeze items typically arrive earlier than promised the manufacturer packed the pots and pans so it arrived in its original box inside an box with a little extra packing for travel the glass lids were packed well so nothing was broken i bought these from because first i want to start cooking more regularly and needed a good set for everyday cooking that will last for years a good place to look for the cook was on where they gave a comparison of the different brands they offered it helped in deciding what type of coating if any would work best for me second the price and ease of purchase original price for this set was 425.00 sales price when i went to macy 's was 299.95 on amazon a couple of weeks ago was 199.95 so already far better than macy 's amazon also had the 8 piece set for the same price which made the 10 piece set an even bigger deal free shipping and a coupon for more money off the grand total from amazon was 174.95 ! ! for a 425.00 set that is not bad at all ! ! i look forward to using these and by all accounts expect them to hold up to their claims of durability the fact that they are oven safe gives me confidence in those claims i rate this set 4 stars for overall appearance weight and anticipation of good cooking and easy clean up if not i promise this review will be amended my advice wait for a holiday sale when you can get the best price the price on this set has already gone up hope this helps
i am in love with this cookware line the weight is great that is very heavy i 've never experienced any '' or other troubles with the cookware itself and that 's even at my new apartment where the stove is simply awful food began turning out better after i purchased these and i will probably purchase no other brand in the future i have had the lids fall from my lid rack that is mounted on my wall a distance of feet and none have broken so fear not if glass lids make you these are well built my only advice is to hand it will keep the rubber grips from warping and the set looking new for years to come
this is great 've owned it for quite a while cleans beautifully and cooks evenly people have jumped to the erroneous conclusion that anodized aluminum and teflon are the same thing because they have a similar color this is not the case check out the facts with a more indepth search for infomation
i purchased this juicer about a year ago and it 's been great the only reason it does n't get 5 stars from me is that when it gets unbalanced you have to make sure to hold the lid on because it shakes and vibrates a whole lot the juice is great the cleanup is easy if a bit and the motor is very powerful i 'd definitely recommend this juicer
have been drinking vegetables for maybe 15 years started with a cheap machine it broke right away spent over 200 on a very good quality masticating machine that thing will outlast me but i found it prohibitively difficult to clean it made the whole process so laborious that i never used it so finally i decided to find a good machine that was easy to clean let me tell you this is it all parts that touch vegetables are stainless steel so they do not stain the machine really impresses with its build quality the juice is simply delicious i now consume many more vegetables per day than would be practical to eat and i feel great and clean up is rediculously fast and easy if you use the filter papers maybe 20 come with it order more immediately and use them you do n't scrub and the whole thing is back in place in maybe a minute and a half overall i have the idea this machine will last for many many years bravo waring you definitely got this one right ! did that help
i bought the waring centrifuge juice extractor because i wanted a machine as efficient as a commercial juicer i 'm pleased with it i 've used the waring for more than 3 years and it 's as good as new it extracts maximum juice from fruits and vegetables leaving waste that is nearly dry it never needs to be oiled or lubricated it only needs to be cleaned which is reasonably simple it 's truly a workhorse its only drawback is that the centrifuge can become unbalanced if a piece of food does n't fly up against the wall as it should this causes a horrible noise and vibration as older washing machines that were not sometimes did in spin cycle if the vibration is minor quickly juicing another piece of produce or forcing the rest of what you 're doing through the feed chute will often fix it but if the vibration is serious you must turn the machine off and wait for it to slow down so that you can remove the offending fruit once you get the hang of juicing it becomes easier to avoid unbalancing the machine putting fruits and vegetables through the chute at the optimum speed helps most produce is of uniform consistency and juices well a slow even force works best some fruit is lumpier however and if an even pressure causes the machine to vibrate try applying pressure then easing up applying pressure again then easing in intervals this works well for pineapple and citrus fruits yes i mention citrus fruits i juice them without the citrus attachment if you peel the fruit slice it in half and remove the seeds there is no problem feed it through the chute with pressure the pith from citrus fruit will block the holes in the strainer basket however preventing further juice from passing through if the holes are blocked you 'll end up with juice sloshing around in the centrifuge and not in your glass if you are juicing citrus this way empty the waste from the strainer basket after you have juiced 2 oranges or the equivalent if you are making a drink that includes citrus juice the other ingredients first then add the citrus i use the disposable paper filters because they make cleanup so much easier they fit around the inside of the strainer basket and allow me to pull all the waste out in one stroke saving me the trouble of having to vigorously scrub the strainer basket to remove it the filters are great for most juices but can not be used with juices that are very thick for example peach juice is so thick that it is practically pulp it can not pass through the filter neither can banana you must forgo the filter for juices with a heavy consistency the waring juice extractor is n't quiet especially when it is juicing it could wake the proverbial dead when it becomes unbalanced but it extracts maximum juice and it holds up very well to wear the plunger cover spring clutch a little knob cutter blade strainer basket and bowl must be washed after every use all but the strainer basket are smooth and exceptionally easy to clean the strainer basket can get waste stuck in it using filters makes it equally easy to clean but even if you do n't a vegetable brush makes pretty quick work of it if you juice a lot i think the waring is worth the investment
this juicer is fabulous ! i use it to make juice like they make at jamba juice it takes only minutes and comes out delightfully refreshing ! be sure you clamp the lid on correctly otherwise the machine will not be properly balanced also wash immediately to avoid a clumpy mess enjoy
i have had many kinds of cookware over the years and circulon is by far the very 4 quart saute pan is excellent for making sauces and browning love it
this is a beautiful and very outstanding blender i love all the delongi appliances this blender has several speeds and types of blending actions will turn ice to snow in a matter of seconds just like the old osters did in the 60 's i love this appliance great buy for me
love that it comes with two jars and blades makes great margaritas does well with baby food too
this is a great blender that is easy to care for and fun to use it does a fine job of blending ingredients including ice to the consistency that you desire the only negative thus far is the fact that it does n't swirl the contents from top to bottom as i 'd like perhaps i have unrealistic expectations
after trying out three lesser '' blenders i decided to spend a little more to see if i could find one that does it all blending fruit chopping ice thoroughly etc without having to shake it or periodically stop the process to stir the ingredients not only does this baby do it all but it does it and quickly yes it costs a bit more though one can buy this model with or without the second stainless steel container but it does what it promised with no fuss whatsoever not only that but the design allows for very quick with no exposed seams that are difficult to clean add to that the cool simple styling and very control dial i 'm a tough one to please but i highly recommend this blender
unlike what the photo suggests the entire set is black and not dark brown this lends a versatile and contemporary look to the tables which would work well if you have furniture however the black finish seems to work against the veneer pattern the black ends up being shiny so not only does the veneer pattern stand out but so do the natural patterns in the wood and any scratches or dings the end result is a rough almost table seems like the wood could also have been sanded down more since there 's still somewhat of a raw feel on the plus side both the coffee table and accompanying end tables are remarkably sturdy they are not easy to get knocked over and they seem able to hold heavy items i 've got my computer printer and feet resting on the coffee table right now and it 's not budging the coffee table is small and more suited to go in front of a loveseat a perk if you 're living in an apartment with limited space an advantage to the black color is that the end tables can go anywhere overall i ca n't complain because 99 is a good deal for cheap apartment furniture it 's functional affordable and reasonably attractive but there 's no mistaking this for anything but low end furniture
these were purchased for my daughter who has a 3 year old son not only are they attractive but they hold up to the wear and tear of a 3 year old they are very sturdy and were easy to assemble in addition she has received many compliments and inquiries as to where they were purchased
we have had this about a month this is great for cleaning up small messes we have it in with our cat litter boxes and it works great for picking up the cat litter ! it has lots of suction for the size we also have wood floors and it is great for going around and sucking up dust bunnies without having to get out the big vac the bunnies seem to collect in corners anyway one thing about wood floors and you can vacuum daily and the dust bunnies will still be there for the car it has plenty of power but not quite enough battery time the box says that it will last about minutes on a charge and it is right we have a minivan so it takes longer than a sedan we have not tried it on wet spills i usually just go get a wash cloth for those it really doesnt hold that much anyway no bags to replace is also great it has a sponge that works as the filter and you can just rinse it out in the sink after emptying the vacuum you do need to let it dry out before you use it again though i imagine that the batteries will only last about a year maybe two just like our coordless phones but the vac comes with instructions to replace the batteries and it looks easy at under 20 for the vac it probably is n't worth it though just buy a new vac ! other reviews i have read say you need more volts and i was n't sure this would work good after trying it i think it is more than enough for what i use it for for a bigger job i get out the big vac
but only lasts about a year
i 've had this for one month so far very reliable easy to use and clean
this machine is way superior to the original and some suceeding versions there is no bulky cradle to fit the vacuum into for recharging just a simple point the suction is powerful i have had no problem picking '' up dust hair christmas tree needles and other small debris with no bag to replace the machine is easy to clean the only caveat i have is that when using the dustbuster for the first time after you have emptied the receptacle try to keep it away from anything that might be blown away as some residual dust albeit a very small amount and air is emitted from the side vents
it 's a nice little vac for the price great suction power we had the old version with the two removable battery cells it did n't make sense to purchase new cells since those are almost as much as the new vacuum itself i have a cordless drill that they can still operate so that is where they are and the vac is in the garbage we 're happy
i 'm not using it for big jobs i have a 2 year old and i use it for the occaisonal spill cleanup and for that purpose alone it 's well worth the price i paid
good things dry and wet pick up light bad things does not have a charging station average suctio
i am a happy happy person with this new gadget it has made my life easier opening bottle tops jars pop tops etc when you have old arthur and your hands hurt this little gem is without a doubt a blessing ! i am so glad i bought it
opens any jar or bottle better than my pipe wrench we got some more to give as christmas presents good for the more mature '' consumer possibly with arthritis in the hands an excellant value
bought this for my mom and had a chance to check it out and use it during a thanksgiving visit pros 1. very sturdy and feels well made has great hand feel and i think it will last a good long time i 'll post an edit to this review if it does n't ! 2. opens a wide variety of containers and should serve my mom well with 90 of her opening needs 3 the portion of this tool that grips the lid to be opened has a feel and provides a good hold on the interior of the tool con 1. the exterior handle where your hand contacts the tool could be prone to slipping it 's hard textured plastic with no rubber gripping surfaces and that concerns me again this is based on a good amount of thanksgiving usage but no long term tests so far i 'll if this review changes based on my mom 's experience
i like to store a large amount of food for my 4 cats and this container is perfect i mix more than 1 type of food together and it is easy to do in this size container it seals tight to keep it fresh and keep out bugs i keep it in the kitchen where it is easy to scoop out the food as needed and i also like how the container can be set in different positions depending on your needs it looks good too
great and reliable product would buy more if i need to
perfect results when baking and cleans up easier than does n't darken or warp in the oven
in my twenties i bought no less than three cookie sheets while my grandmother an avid baker was still using her aluminum bakeware from the 40 's i later inherited a few of her aluminum pans and i could n't believe the difference my cookies were no longer crispy and brown on the outside and soft in the middle they were baked evenly i was also able to scub the sheet and place it in the dishwasher something you ca n't do with varieties additionally there is no danger of having teflon flake into your baked goods aluminum is tried and tested and provides professional results buy the right cookie sheet and buy it once ! i have both the half and quarter sheets by nordic as well as the pan i 'm a devoted fan
i did much research on this and other coffee grinders before purchasing it even talking to kitchenaid for reassurance that the nickel pearl color had no engineering upgrades that would make it a better unit than the less expensive red one it does n't and in fact william sonoma still sells the few red ones they have left for the retail price i had previously used a braun burr grinder for over ten years then two solis maestro burr grinders each one lasting only a couple of years quite a disappointment as they were not inexpensive units the kitchenaid pro line coffee mill is fabulous it grinds beautifully a consistent result i started on setting 5 for my kitchenaid pro line coffee maker the best coffee maker on the market for automatic drip coffee and worked up to a 6.5 setting for the flat basket filter it produces an outstanding grind and a superb cup of coffee i use very oily dark roast peet 's coffee beans and have had no problems with the machine i 've cleaned it once the instruction manual makes it a very easy process and found some impacted grounds in the burrs after one month 's use which kitchenaid said is to be expected with oily beans and this has been confirmed by others on i have found as others have noted that on occasion the beans have to be helped '' down the chute i use the end of the accompanying brush and that sends the beans on their way without further interruption as far as the lid seal of the hopper is concerned a grinder hopper is not meant to store coffee beans ! they need to be kept in an opaque airtight container and there are such products available at any coffee house as to others with production complaints with initial units i give them no credence as they have failed to utilize kitchenaid 's hassle free no questions asked free replacement warranty sometimes a defective unit may pass quality control give them a second chance ! i think this is the best coffee grinder i 've ever seen for quality of construction sheer beauty solid parts terrific glass hopper and receptacle very strong and bottom line amazing grind performance you can not find a better grinder and the price is a steal
i 've gone through a number of grinders over the years and am hoping that this kitchenaid will last longer than others the grind is consistent and quite adjustable even with a glass container there is still static causing cling to the sides and dispersal of grinds on the counter a small price to pay for fresh ground coffee because it 's a slower it 's quieter the flavor of the brew is better because the beans were n't heated when ground read the instruction manual for happy results the first time another commenter says kitchenaid will replace the hopper or the receptacle with a later design that works better i 'm thinking about following up on that the beans did n't feed through but only one time so i upended it and shook the beans back down and all was fine again
i 've had this for about a month now great ! it does n't bog down with dark roasts or flavored roasts like my old machine and the grind ! boy is it uniform ! very little static with the glass container no muss no fuss about the only negative i can think of is a couple of beans do n't make it all the way into the grinding mechanism the little brush that comes with it gets most of them but the design allows a couple to get hung up no big deal i love this thing it 's all whole beans for me from now on
i have owned several cheaper burr grinders but decided to take the plunge into a higher end model since the others only lasted a year or so this kitchenaid grinder is substantial both in weight and construction i am very pleased with the grind for drip coffee the only minor drawback is that you have to coax the few remaining beans into the grind that do not fall in on their own a minor inconvenience also if you are looking for a grinder that measures output by the cup this is not your grinder you have to premeasure for me also a minor inconveniece i expect to get many years of good service from it as others who own it have related in their reviews
i 'm pleased with this grinder like one of the other reviews i had to do the extra ajusting to get the right grind for my espresso after that it 's a champ also recieve lots of complaments on the style frankly all the complaints i read about in other reviews i disagree
this grinder was recieved and out of box worked flawlessly despite the many settings all were consistant in grind and the power is incredible smooth quiet and construction is flawless as an engineer the design is the best i have seen compared to either home or professional burr grinders it is obviously the best grinder on the market as a coffee the grind is best i have seen and it definately improves your cup of coffee 's flavor this is due to the consistant and perfection in it 's grind i could not recommend this grinder more to any household definately the best buy for your dollar
this is a well made coffee grinder that does as well as the ones at the supermarket that cost much more money yes the beans will stick and not feed evenly from the upper hopper but the one at supermarket does that too ! that is just the nature of coffee beans i use a chopstick i keep on hand to break up the beans before i turn on the grinder the upper lid does n't fit tightly but i do n't find this a problem as it is making an adequate seal and does n't rattle during operation it is much quieter than my old blade unit and grinds much more evenly disassembly for cleaning is very easy the glass hoppers cause minimal static and sticking of beans and grinds i think the engineers at kitchen aid that designed this coffee grinder made one that seems to me works as well as the big ones at the supermarket if they threw in a good motor i would imagine this unit will last many years judging from the sealed roller bearing they used in the grind adjustment assembly instead of a cheap bushing i would guess the motor matches the excellent quality of the rest of the machine this unit was a great value for the price
i 've had this vacuum for close to a year and i still love it ! it does such a great job cleaning ! when i use my old vacuum and then go over it with the eureka i still get a significant amount of additional dirt i contemplated buying the more expensive cyclonic vacuum but could n't justify the price and i 'm glad i did n't get it ! i think this one is just as good ! i highly recommend here 's a final thought when something gets caught in the wheel my old vacuums would burn the belts and start to smell this one has never broken a belt or started to burn up when i get something caught up in it ! i think that 's pretty significant
i just love this vacuum i wanted one that would pick up dog hair which my corgi mix produces in abundance this vacuum picks it up by the shovel also it has a container for the dirt that you just empty no bags to buy i vacuumed with my old canister vacuum then used this one it was stunning how much dust and fur came up from my clean '' carpet it is heavy but i find if i hold the handle down and push it with the inside of my palm it moves with less effort from me it has a wide nose '' that allows me to clean the hall really fast but which is a bit inconvenient in the living room to sum up buy this vacuum
even though i vacuumed my carpeting with my old vacuum on a regular basis my carpets were still filthy i just never realized it when i first got my eureka the dirt cup was filled with cat hair and other debris in no time ! someone else said they could make another cat out of the cat hair their vacuum picked up with all the cat fur from my three kitties my vacuum picked up i could make a whole family of cats and have enough left over to knit a sweater if i could knit that is my furniture carpeting and rugs look so much nicer i have asthma and find that i am actually able to breathe better and not use my emergancy inhaler nearly as often as i had been the power paw works very well on my furniture and throw pillows the money i spent on this vacuum will certainly be made up by not having to buy sweeper bags all the time maybe i am a bit warped but i enjoy seeing how much the vacuum has picked up when i remove the dust cup to empty it i get a real sense of accomplishment because i 'm disabled i was concerned that this vacuum might be difficult to handle and am pleased to say it is easier for me to operate than my old vacuum this is the best vacuum i 've ever owned i was so pleased with this vacuum after first using it i left it out to show off to all my friends when they came to visit i have never before in all my years been excited about a vacuum cleaner let alone enjoy using one believe it or not i am actually happy my old vacuum cleaner stopped working and i had to buy a new one and the eureka was the one i chose
i completely lucked out finding this awesome peice of machinery friends were visiting so i was getting ready by cleaning the house which of course means that all important 'last step ' of making the carpets 'look ' fresh i pulled out my very light oreck circa 2003 and noticed that it was n't picking up the stuffing my dog pulled out of a toy after changing the bag i tried again still nothing so i ran to target and spent about 30 minutes researching what they had available what really caught my eye was the small brochure in the dyson area it went through dyson 's frustrations of vacuums losing suction that 's what drove me nuts the price seemed a little high but then i remembered that i spent that much on the oreck more for bags so home we went and little did i know it would change my attitude about carpet cleaning setting it up took some time i 'm the kind of person that wants to be able to just plug it in but unfortunately it did take about 20 minutes it was the hose that tripped me up you have to take the long tube and put it inside the hose after that it was just popping pieces in place i started to vacuum the living area first and just could not believe what it was picking up the clear container is the genius part of this cleaner you can see everything that is your carpet i vacummed one little strip behind my couch and had to empty it two times ! ! my oreck had n't picked up anything over the last year so i had layers of dirt and grime which made me sick to think about the next few hours were spent picking up all the dirt that had accumulated over the last year i must of emptied the container 50 times and really we 're not dirty people ! it 's easy to empty the container too you just pull it off place it over a trash can and press a button to open the trap door it comes with a very long cord yea ! and all of the attachments stay firmly in place you should hear a snap when you store them when you place it upright and it 's running it does get louder because there is a little grated cover that allows the air to flow otherwise it 's as loud as a normal vacuum and while not heavy it does feel sturdy when you pull it back and forth my husband wishes that he bought me this years ago i literally went from loathing to vacuum to actually enjoying it ! the first week i vacuumed every day so i could see what would show up in my canister while i 'm not doing it everyday my carpet does look better now that i 'm taking better care of it i 've just ordered a hoover steam cleaner agility based on the reviews posted on amazon as soon as i get to use it i plan to post another review i 'm thinking that with this dynamic combo my carpet is going to look even better
i bought the dyson animal for years ago it 's absolutely fantastic now i bought the dc 07 as a gift for my daughter i 'd have gotten the animal or one with the swivel but the price keeps going up and i feel that 700 is getting a little ridiculous besides the 400 dc 07 cleans as good as the 700 one it just has fewer attachments and is an older model it still really sucks i would even suggest that you get one reconditioned over any new bissell or hoover my guess is that those that have been sent back to dyson are sent back by people who ca n't get used to the way this vacuum is engineered it is the most amazing piece of engineering i 've seen from the way the basic hose becomes a 17 foot wand to the simplicity of emptying and i must say that when i did n't understand something usually could n't find the manual the folk at dyson in chicago were most accommodating they even helped me put mine back together the dog attacked it maybe that 's why it 's the animal '' over the phone and they really knew how to explain it simply
i 've wanted a dyson for a long time but for me spending over 400 on a vacuum seemed a little extreme well not anymore i finally took the plunge and ordered the dyson all floors last week from it arrived today and it only took me ten minutes to assemble it i do n't know what the other posters are referring to when they say it is complicated to assemble all i had to do was put the hose together and pull off a few pieces of tape then i put the dyson to the test i have a 400 square foot apartment with a bathroom downstairs most of my apartment has a thick shag carpet except for the kitchen which is a tiled floor the bathroom floor is cement with a thin pile carpet over top of it the dyson handled it all without making a sound i 've read reviews here that say the vacuum will make a terrible racket on thick carpets and that it will suck up a lot of the carpet fiber my dyson did neither i have stairs leading down to the bathroom which are also carpeted i sat the dyson downstairs in the bathroom per the instructions which say to put the dyson on the lowest floor when vacuuming stairs and i used the attachment on the end of the wand to do the stairs not only was i able to vacuum the entire stairs but because of the length of the wand i was able to turn the entire apparatus around and vacuum the risers as well this is something i could never do with my former vacuum at least not very well i was a bit worried about using the hose on the dyson for quick pick ups and dusting because there are other reviewers here who say that the suction diminishes when using the hose attachments let me just say that is not the case at all on top of my kitchen cabinets i have old bottles baskets and assorted antiques that have been sitting up there since i moved in four years ago i have only tried vacuuming up there on a couple occasions and the two vacuums i used failed miserably in two regards 1 their hoses could never reach and 2 they could not adequately remove the dust which is of the kind that resembles grizzly bear fur the dyson excelled at this task i had no problem reaching the hose up there with the brush attachment and in one pass the vacuum sucked up layers of dust like a finger scooping frosting off a cake the length that this hose can stretch astounds me and i can tell while using it that it is made extremely well and will last for a long time gone are the days of using cheap vacuums with equally cheap hoses ! now as far as emptying the canister and keeping it clean this is not as daunting a task as some have claimed i was able to remove the canister and dump the dirt in one simple move also if you gently tap the side of the shroud while it 's over the trash you can dislodge a lot of the dirt and debris caught up inside it i have not taken the dust bin assembly apart yet to do any thorough cleaning but i reckon it is no more difficult than cleaning out my sewing machine after every project i found that a lot of the complaints here could be rectified by simply reading the manual it is very detailed with pictures even and there is even an 800 number for dyson support all in all i 'm giving this vacuum five stars for it 's stellar performance it handled all the cleaning tasks with ease and between the filters and the solid construction of the chassis and hose i do n't think i 'll ever need to buy another vacuum again my final word there should be a picture of this vacuum next to the word phenomenal in the dictionary
let 's just say i will never own another hoover dirt devil or any of that garbage again ! ! ! ! i love this vacuum so much i bought another one for upstairs my cleaning lady also thinks they are great you just have to get used to it and its unique features it picks up great and has not lost suction is n't that what a vacuum is supposed to do
wow wow wow this vacuum is awesome prior to getting the dyson i had the bissell 3750 bagless vacuum for a few years and liked it a lot i even went so far as to put a review for it here on amazon and for the price it 's still a good choice but if you want serious cleaning power the go dyson and never look back the dyson is quieter lighter sucks harder and works better than any vacuum i 've ever used the price will probably scare a lot of people away i paid about twice as much for the dyson as the bissell but the dyson works 5 to 10 times better if you have allergies and my wife has bad allergies you 'll notice a difference within a couple of days i 've read all the other reviews and from what i can tell all the negatives are pretty much summed up by 1. it 's expensive 2. it 's loud 3. it sucks too hard well folks it 's a vacuum cleaner it 's supposed to be loud and suck hard as for the price to me it 's well worth it but you make that decision for yourself
when i first saw the commercial for the dyson vaccuum i thought yeah right it will get clogged and thrown away like the other one 's i 've purchased but this vaccuum is great it has not clogged i feel as though i 've just purchased it everytime i use it when i think about all the vaccuum 's i 've purchased over the last 4 yrs i could have bought 5 dyson vaccuum 's it really is a great machine and believe me when i tell you i use it a lot i have a 2 yr old and an 8 old so i vaccuum alot give it a try you will not be dissapointed
i have only had this vacuum for a couple of months but it 's a great piece it works well very easy to operate picks everything up on one pass you do n't need to go back and forth over the same piece of carpet i 'm really pleased with this purchase
this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !
the bread tray will be a nice addition to my other fiestaware i think it will be useful for a number of things my only complaint is that it is a darker blue than i had expected
the fiestaware bread tray is almost identical to the discontinued omelet plates that bennington potters used to make it is an amazingly useful design perfect for omelets burritos soup in a deep bowl or large cup and combos two item lunches etc much better than putting a couple things on a small round luncheon plate on this each is able to occupy it 's neat separate half of this oval plate oh and lets not forget it 's great as a bread plate
bowls are nice but some foods fit better on these bread trays even things that are n't bread my trays get loaded up with asparagus grilled skewers of shrimp or veggies and other long items also nice for a couple of potted herb plants
this bread tray is just the right size and the perfect finishing touch to a table set with fiestaware
of course i wanted to get my family expensive stemless wine glasses that sound like a bell when toasting but with a small christmas budget i decided these would have to do i am thrilled with these lightweight lovelies and the price is right ! i would n't use stemless for the white wines as i feel they should be very cold and the hands will heat up these too much for white however love these for the rich yummy reds ! !
we have had these glasses for a while now and are very pleased with them true they are very delicate but they are made from borosilicate glass which is quite sturdy we clean them in the dishwasher and have not had any problems with that although you should make sure they do n't touch other glass or metal in the dishwasher these wine glasses have quickly become our favourites
in my life i have used a lot of syrup dispensers most of which were poorly designed and leaked this one is neither i really love the way this dispenser works the top is nicely designed and executed out of brushed stainless and the gasket seals tightly the spout is indeed for us even our 10 year old ca n't make it drip and that 's saying something the glass container is larger than it looks since the glass goes all the way to the top of the handle inside the lid my only wish is that they made one a bit bigger that could hold a full bottle of real maple syrup
this is a quality dispenser but the 30 price tag seems very high also it is not watertight if that is important to you you might want to consider other product i 'd recommend the rsvp endurance stainless steel honey dispenser
i 've tried so many syrup dispensers all of which dripped and often the flow mechanism would get stuck this one is the first which has neither problem it looks quite nice too wish it were a little bigger
we heat our pure maple syrup which makes it thinner than syrup we have tried numerous syrup dispensers and they all leaked until we purchased this one the only drawback is its size it works great for the two of us but a larger family could require at least two of them
i had been looking for a dispenser for a while for my mounting cereal shelf in the kitchen i have a mostly stainless steel kitchen and i did n't want the piling cereal boxes to be exposd anymore i was really looking for a more uniformed look i researched my options and the price i found on amazon was really the best i knew i wanted multiple dispensers but oddly enough it was more cost effective to buy multiple single dispensers than a couple of the double ones that are available no matter i purchased 5 and they are lined up beautifully on my stainless steel shelving unit they are easily put together cleaned and used my my five children they look cohesive and pretty when they are filled with colorful cereal nonethess the children ranging in ages from find them accessible and use them often they come with a small plastic covering that is right at the opening that helps in keeping the cereal fresh i was worried about the larger cereal coming out but the turner that pushes the contents out are thick and durable i have had no trouble whatsoever i would think that these are much more durable than the plastic alternatives if you have the opportunity i would think that these are the better choice i really have nothing negative to say about the dispenser i would highly recommend it
nice lightweight blanket for use in the summer well made and durable
i like the one i recieved better than the one shown because the prongs are much longer it fits into my henckel 's international classic knife block it 's a tad bit flimsey compared to the other international classic knives it 's very nice though
this is a superb large steamer insert it is great for large quantities of veggies or whatever you would like to steam there is nothing like the flavor of freshly steamed veggies ! it fits perfectly in the 6 8 and 12 quart stock pots i have only used it in the 6 and 8 quart stock pots myself it is made very well and is excellent quality built to last all clad truly is lifetime cookware i am sure you will not be disappointed and it is backed by a lifetime warranty what more can you ask for highly recommended !
i purchased this sprayer to us with spray butter well it does work but a full pump only get a small amount of spray probably because it is so thick but it still sprays better than the plastic bottle the butter comes with it is easy to pump the bottle so i think it is worth the trouble to me hope this help
i love my oil mister sprayer thingy pour the oil in pump the cap about 5 times and a fine mist comes out no it 's not a lot of oil that comes out each spray but enough to coat a inch frypan to grill quesadillas or grilled cheese sandwiches on i used to use butter for this task but no more it 's absolutely perfect for coating your pan in an instance where you would use butter or 'pam ' cooking spray no it 's not going to get a whole cookie sheet in one spraying but i think its well worth the extra pump
i love this thing at work we 're not allowed to heat up foods with great odor '' such as fish popcorn etc i love grilled fish seafood lamb and all those other offensive '' foods that have a scent that linger but ca n't bring them to work for christmas my sister bought me this thing and voila ! i can zap my food in the containers in the morning cover them up and put them in the bento badda bing hot lunch ! if you 're looking for a bigger meal bento holds about one ricebowl of rice and rice bowl of food on the top this may not be for you but if you 're a light eater at lunch like me this will work just fine yumm
this is the best mixer i have ever owned and i have been a homemaker for 40 years i love the many different speeds it has a build in timer so you know how long you have been using it at that speed it has a retractable cord so it does n't get all twisted and tangled when stored it whips up great mashed potatoes you can tell i really love it
i 've used it for a year now and i can not buy a cappuccino at starbucks or any other mediocre place now the espresso in my home is the best you can get outside of italy we are even buying a second one for our summer house ! ! !
rancilio silvia is a great way to get a pro machine at home but like all pro machines much depends on its enviroment with proper equipment and training it can make excellent espresso but without either it makes drek look for at least a rancilio rocky grinder or even more appropriate a mazzer mini a good grinder and a little technique makes all the difference
i have owned several different expresso machines in different price ranges hands down this machine is the best i 've ever used the machine works exactly as it is supposed to i use it every day sometimes a couple times per day and the espresso never changes it 's always delicious and the steamed milk comes out perfectly i 've even left the machine on all day a couple of times and it still does not affect the machine it keeps working like it 's brand new the only downside is that it takes about 45 minutes for this machine to heat up however there are websites out there that can tell you how to get around this and have your shot of espresso in about 10 minutes
the color is much prettier than i had thought and they are so soft too
no question that high quality cookware is easier to work with lasts longer and produces better results i 've been using all clad for years and swear by it however the coating on all cookware whether it 's all clad calphalon or whatever wears out over time no matter how careful you are so why pay 150 for the name all clad on a 12 '' non stick pan when 50 gets you a very similar pan with the same coating from nordicware i actually have 8 '' non sticks from both nordicware and all clad and i detect no difference in heft durability or results the value is so good that i bought an 8 '' 10 '' and 12 '' nordicware for less than one 10 '' all clad
when space is at a premium as in rvs or where you want an extra near the point of most frequent messes as around a table this picks up small messes and even stores them neatly and tightly till you get near a wastebasket i have had mine 2 years no sign of wear bought 4 more for christmas stocking stuffers takes a minute to get the hang of unclipping brush from pan but follow instructions thumb on red button to flex it down in the middle rather than direct pulling it apart
i bought this casserole last year after debating over all of the le creuset pots and casseroles on which one would be the most versatile and believe me this casserole is the one ! it handles any kind of stovetop cooking with ease it 's a fabulous risotto pan and it goes into the oven with no problems lid or no lid it also serves as a beautiful pan to bring to the table but be sure to put something under it to protect your table surface because this pan is cast iron and retains heat very well it is incredibly heavy but it 's performance easily makes up for that be sure to follow the manufacturer insrtuctions hand wash and dry immediately no metal utensils and no harsh scrubbing and your pan will certainly become your new favorite piece of cookware you own
a great pan as usual with le creuset but very heavy our household is used to le creuset the round is probably our size but this and it 's lid are deemed extraordinarily heavy we use it and we 're glad to have it but would n't recommend it for weaklings
love this fan circulates air very well soothing sound that rocks me to sleep like a baby ! would definitely recommend this product
this fan is neither as powerful nor as quiet as the vornado fan it tries to imitate but compared to some of the other fans on the market today the honeywell mega turbo is pretty darn good it moves an impressive amount of air is solidly constructed and comes with a reassuring warranty update i just discovered that this fan can not be taken apart for cleaning i would change the rating to two stars if i could
i love this jucier it does cost a little more but worth every penny i have used cheaper juicers however you get much more juice out of the it is your health you decide
my fiancee 's parents fell in love with frozen banana pineapple smoothies that they had in hawaii and noted that the champion juicer was all that was used in making this favored treat my fiancee and her sisters purchased one of these for their parents and recently i was fortunate enough to try out the frozen creations the frozen banana is delicious add nothing else but a frozen banana to the juicer and you have a perfect creamy dessert ! same with pineapples and other fruits yesterday i opened up a champion juicer under the christmas tree i was ecstatic we found a few apples that were lying around and the juicer in seconds had a jarful of dark foamy juice we took some grapes that were not going to get eaten and threw those in the juicer as well and had a perfect glass of grape juice i highly recommend this juicer cleans in about 2 minutes and is very easy to operate
bought these a few weeks ago and have found them to live up to expectations
reidel is a genius he has custom shaped each wine glass to complement every different wine imaginable your wine will never taste as good as when it 's in a riedel glass even those sale brands taste expensive when cradled in this fine crystal basinette you 'll never drink from another glass again
these are my first set of wine glasses and though expensive compared to sets sold by ikea these riedels are worth the price i experienced aromas from my usual wine selections that i 've never knew were there before since receiving these glasses a few months ago i had the displeasure of drinking wines from glasses of lower quality in restaurants there was an older review on amazon from someone who said he brought his riedel glass to a wine tasting event and i felt like doing the same but unfortunately that would n't make sense on a regular basis i am happy with my purchase and i would rather put up with the risk of breaking one and getting the most out of my wines than buying some cheap stock ikea glasses and not know what i 'm missing
i bought one for myself several years ago and have loved it my parents also liked it so i bought one for them this year for christmas it broke on the first use they have sent it back to be fixed under warranty do not know yet if it will be with or without complications hopefully the manufacturer will fix it without any problems
got it for christmas and have used it several times since it replaced a chef 's choice sharpener i got 12 years ago and still use i have a collection of high quality henkel kitchen knives and this sharpener has them razor sharp with just a few passes definately a worthwhile purchase
i ordered the chef 's choice 120 and even before it arrived my cook 's magazine issue came and low and behold there was a rating of all the electric knife sharpeners the magazine gave this product high praise and i back that review up with my own i have had the sharpener for about 3 months and could not be more pleased with its ease of use and the quality of sharpness it gives to my knife blades if you are not interested in buying a wet stone and a throp to sharpen your own knives by hand in my opinion this is the only other alternative save your pennies and buy one of your own the only down side is that it 's one of the most expensive on the market but hey you only need one and you can pass it on to the kids
i was a little nervous about spending this much on a sharpener now that i have had it a few days i wish i had bought it sooner if you understand the basics of sharpening this tool is very easy to use if not it might take a little practice to get the hang of it the instruction are pretty good and clear i have sharpened everything from good quality kitchen knives to tag sale pocket knives when this machine is done with them you could shave with em amazing i can see one pitfall for people who do n't understand sharpening or who have weak eyesight if you have a blade with a deeper grind angle than this machine uses you first have to the edge on the coarse wheel if you do n't you are simply adding a second bevel behind the old one and leaving the cutting edge alone this may be why some people have problems on one cheap knife i had i first had to really grind on the first stage wheel to pull an entire new bevel once i did it was no problem
may 27 update as i suspected this was a case of me not knowing how to use the product when first purchased well i 've practiced and learned and this is the real deal sharpens everything even my old swiss army pocket knife just be careful items get so sharp that cut fingers become routine raised my rating to 4 stars would be 5 but i still find the unit kind of pricey but hey it does all it 's supposed to and does it well and that 's the real key ! original review first this ai n't a cheap sharpener check out the price yourself i used it one time some new just out of the box knives as well as an old henkels i own maybe it 's my own ineptitude but i see no difference in either the new knives were part of a set and the ones seemed no sharper than those i did n't sharpen and my old henkels is still very dull and likely ready for the scrap heap so yes so far i am disappointed is it me not knowing how to use this sharpener maybe but so far i feel this has been a big waste of money hell buy a steel sharpening tool a lot cheaper and gets the job done better
i took my knives to chesapeake knife tool to have them sharpened and they destroyed the edge i saw that cooks illustrated recommended chef 's choice sharpeners and decided to give it a try it took about an hour but i was able to restore the edge and now my knives are just like new
i think this knife sharpener is great i went with this model with the sharpening process to help out those knives in really rough shape it was very easy to figure out and while chef 's choice recommended not using the stage three sharpener i had to for some of my knives i am used to taking my good henkels over to the local butcher to have him sharpen them for a fee of he did a great job but this gets the knives just as sharp and will pay for themselves it even worked on my little pocket knife it just works
i 've sharpened everything i 'm not sure what one reviewer was doing wrong that they could n't sharpen very dull knives i took out my grandfather 's hunting knife that has been in the shed for 50 years and used as a tool for everything it had the edge of a butter knife it only took me a few minutes to get it sharp enough the shave with i 've had this sharpener for two years and i 'm back to buy another for my and i like my ! i 've sharpened many of my friends knives too i could n't be happier
great machine pops all the kernels only drawback is the powerpop disks are hard to find needed to order them online
i love popcorn so i decided to use popcorn that was not or microwave ready i now use regular popcorn and pop it in the presto powerpop it works like a charm almost no unpopped kernels almost none at all i melt a little smart balance add a dab of salt and i have healthy convenient and totally delicious popcorn this from the presto powerpop microwave
the great thing about this microwave popper besides popping perfect popcorn is that you can have it exactly as you like it you can pop wth no oil or with your choice of oils to vary the flavor you top it as you like with butter margerine olive oil salt butter flavored salt garlic onion powder chili powder you want it is durable we bought our original popper 15 years ago and it is still working like new bought a second popper recently so we could produce more perfect popcorn at once i prefer jolly time white popcorn but all brands work just fine
this is a great popper pros as quick as microwave pop corn the ability to control how much butter oil salt etc gets added lower cost than microwave popcorn most all kernels pop the powercup concentrators last poppings cons the powercup concentrators are an additional cost typically though amazon sell a package of 8 for about 2.00 sometimes the powercup concentrators slip while popping
this is one of the best units i have ever used the care of the powercups is a bit tricky but just let cool and wipe with a dry cloth and you will be fine we love this unit because we have little mess and fresh popcorn instead of microwave popcorn in a bag which tastes nothing like the fresh popped corn i love to add spicy salt to my oil before adding the popcorn which will lightly cover the popcorn to create your own unique tastes i highly recommend this unit
this popper works fairly well excpt that u must use an insert to get maximium popping experience so when u run out othe insert which are included 5 u must buy refills a real pain in the neck
we have been searching for a stainless steel papertowel holder for sometime now and we finally decided to purchase this one from they truly can make your shopping easier to do without ever having to leave your home i am very pleased with the paper towel holder and
i ordered this to make my husband he loves it ! not only does it look great it is very functional the base is heavy enough to allow tearing of the towels this is a great looking useful item in my kitchen
i 've used it once it works fairly well no problems yet
item was as advertised i used a neighbors for several years prior to finding this on amazon very pleased with its ability to sharpen and hone a knife to a razor sharp edge
i currently own a sharpener similar to the one above that i bought years ago at a farm fair and they do a terrific job at keeping knives sharp one thing that is not mentioned eventually the sharpener needs to be cleaned to keep it working well all that you need to do is wash it and wipe off the shapener to keep it in top working orde
if your knives are dull chances are you need to sharpen them before you need to hone them get a steel such as this one this steel will quickly sharpen your knives do n't try to sharpen your knives with the honing steels that come with most knive sets or that are popularly available or you 'll wreck the honing steel as well as waste a lot of elbow grease they say to use a steel at least as long as your knife i do n't have any 12 '' knives but i like the little extra room for
this product is a real convience for someone who uses alot of hard or soft boiled eggs easy to clean i never have to worry about not hearing the buzzer when the eggs are done it is very loud and very annoying
i just begin a wilton cake decorating class 1 at michael 's and this book comes free with the class which is 18 instructor says these course books should retail about at most you should take the class in addition to read this book the experience of live teaching by an experienced instructor is invaluable during this class you will learn the beginner cake decoration techniques it 's a lot of fun and if you do n't want to proceed onto course ii or iii it should be fine with just decorating your average cupcake cookies and basic cakes though most people love it so much that they do advance however i do have to caution that the course i tool kit you can buy 19.99 michael 's is only the bare minimum it does not have all the things you will need for the first class so be prepared to develop this hobby and pay more depending on what you want for other
just a note you get this book free when you sign up to take the wilton cake class course 1 at least you do at michael 's arts crafts where i took mine the book is easy to understand pictures are literally step by step and include instruction such as offhand '' meaning it will tell you that something should resemble an ice cream cone or look like a behive to swirl here or lightly brush here sweeping motion etc i found it very refreshing not to all be spoken in terms that only people who attended culinary school would understand it also shows you the pictures of suggested supplies you will need in the beginning of the book so your not running back to the store each time you start a new segment i would suggest just taking the class because on top of getting the book free you do get a lot more tips and advice from the instructor that you can jot down in the ample space imbetween pictures and notes in the book but if you too busy or there is n't a class scheduled near you this book would certainly suffice in helping you get started
if you are like me unable to take wilton course 1 class or just want to get a head start before taking the class this book is a great investment for you all the method taught in course 1 class are given here with step by step color picture if you do n't are unable to master the skills that is fine just practice and practice you will be ok i suggest you use a large flat dinner plate instead of the practice board its much easier to clean up or the buttercream i learned how to make butter cream roses and shells thanks to this book in addition to wilton 's website video i suggest everyone to invest on this book you can always sell it later if you no longer want it
the three bowls are nice but on the heavy side due to the fact that they are stoneware i failed to read that part and thought they would be lighter in weight they are just as described and will be a nice little gift for my cousin who has a black and white kitchen
i purchased this canner because after doing much research this was the perfect canner for me i have 2 large canners that i can vegetables and meat in and one has a dial gauge and the other is a weighted gauge that makes a hissing the 2 canners i prefer the one that hisses because i can be doing other things in the kitchen and surrounding rooms and know that the canner pressure is not getting too high or too low because i can hear has to constantly monitor the dial gauge because it does not make noise it is just like a kitchen thermometer and has a hand that points to the present pressure the canner is at many times my dial gauge pressure has gone too high only to turn it down and it goes to for me the weighted gauge canners are the best because i can hear the hissing noise and know whether my pressure is too high or too low i love this canner it is very user friendly and easy to have tried making cheescake which came out very well i just made a meatloaf last night that took me to husband just loved it the company is very accessible i called them because i noted a small dent in the pot of my new canner and they told me to return emailed amazon and the very next day they had a replacement canner on the provided a return shipping label and i just used the box that i had gotten my new canner in to mail the dented canner back i am very impressed with amazon they have great customer service i love this canner and would not hesitate on buying another amazon had great prices on this canner also
i am so pleased with the fagor duo 10 qt pressure it is easy to use and the instructions were easy to follow delivery was quick and the price was right do n't know how i lived without it for so long i use it every night after work and my dinners are fantastic i highly recommend this product thanks ! louis
i bought this pressure cooker one month ago and it saved us a lot of time and money i bought a pressure cooker and i going to buy another smaller pot fagor is durable stainless well built and shiny i bought and used pressure cooker for the first time and the experience is very positive highly recommended
we purchased this cooker based on the recommendation of a cooks illustrated review and we have not been disappointed at all ! the capacity is just what we need for big soups and the pressure system offers good flexibility in terms of cooking times and tenderness we made a fabulous tender and juicy braised short rib dish in less than 2 hours from start to not a bad deal
i have a white stove with black burners that are such an eyesore when i want my kitchen to look 100 and i am so pleased with these burner covers they are just the right touch to keep my kitchen looking bright and clean
looks very good on my stove and pleased with the quality
it is better then i hoped it word be e'z to read and progra
i 've had other digital thermometers with temperatures that were just confusing to use finding the preferred temperature for any meat or poultry item is such a simple matter any decent cookbook will have them many recipes specify and there are always the many online resources that i much prefer the straightforward approach here of just inserting the probe and checking the display occasionally i also love the little gadget that allows you to attach it to a saucepan for candies and other liquids that need careful timing i happily threw out my old candy thermometer after using this one it 's more accurate and easier to read highly recommend
worka well but did n't come with very good directions on its use fortunately it was not that hard to figure out i like the magnet on the back that you can use to stick to the range hood for easy access as well as seeing the timer from a distance
if you plan on having plants in your aquarium then injecting into your tank is highly recommended having a system for me is the easiest cheapest and safest way to go as opposed to a system when using a system like this hagen one it 's impossible to overdose in your tank which is nice remember having watts of quality '' fluorescent lighting per gallon compact fluorescent fixtures seems to me to be the best choice in your aquarium is even more important than adding this off the shelf system should be sufficient for beginning aquarists who are starting out with plants fish do n't need extra while not as efficient or cheap as a diy one it does a decent job of putting a fair amount of in the tank for about 2 week periods at a time people who also do n't want to mix their own yeast mixture will find the packets more convenient however less effective the hagen diffuser that dissolves the bubbles into the water does a decent job however there is waste meaning bubbles escape to the surface before being dissolved but you still will get a raise in the tank 's level so if you are new to systems and want something that is minimal investment 35 and do n't want to make your own system then this is a no brainer system i think you should get it and help your plants to thrive but if you want a cheaper much more effective system then do this for gallon tank use one 2 liter soda bottle for use 2. mix teaspoon of bakers yeast in warm water and then let it sit for min then dissolve 2 cups of sugar into filtered water and pour into soda bottle add the yeast drill a hole in the soda bottle cap and either glue an air line to run through it or buy a metal airline connector like from lowes or home depot and glue it using goop into the cap after you have the air line running out from the soda bottle if you have two then connect them using a t brass connector run it into your aquarium and dissolve the using a diffuser like this hagen one howbeit not efficient an air stone also not efficient or into a small pop bottle that a rio power head is forcing water into to completely dissolve the bubbles you can search around and find photos on how this is done after all of my trial and errors the above method using soda bottles with a metal airline connector in the cap glued in with goop and a rio power head is the best cheapest and most effective system for pumping into your tank if you are purchasing this hagen system just remember that for every 20 gallons of water you have in your aquarium you need to set up another hagen canister so for a 40 gallon tank buy 2 of these but remember you will get a nice rise in levels but not near the level you would using a forced water reactor using a power head there are two parts to a system the amount and quality of bubbles being produced and then also the amount those bubbles are being diffused into the aquarium water the best is having the bubbles completely disappear into the water then you know there is no waste to your production to find out how much is effectively being dissolved into your tank search online for the measurement calculator this is measured by the ratio of kh and ph in your tank as long as you have n't used ph buffers hope this helps you in making a valued purchase
i have used this system for two years it works pretty well hagen 's yeast and 'stabilizer ' last about a month in the winter weeks in summer when the yeast seems to burn off quicker i did once lose a fish that got trapped in the diffuser but that fish had been looking unhealthy inactive not feeding anyway you can use bread yeast and baking soda instead of hagen 's expensive yeast but it does n't last as long the important thing is that is released into the tank and the plants look healthy i do n't bother to test my ph in my 20 gallon tank so i do n't know the effect on acidity
this product works well producing relatively easily and cheaply compared to having a pressurized canister and regulator etc be sure to educate yourself about in fish tanks it 's good for plants but too much could be bad for fish for example i operate an airstone when lights are out at night only this diffuses the which is not needed by plants in the dark and plants are not producing oxygen in the dark put air pump and airstone on a timer you need to learn the basics of injection even for this simple system if you do you will have no problems only great plants i have only small fish under 3 inches in my 55 gal planted tank not one fish has ever suffered as a result of fertilization but the plants grow much much better ! i see no reason why a diy powder solution would not work will be going to this for the price you get all you need to get started to make your plants look great !
i gave this item to my daughter as a chrstmas gift i do n't think she has used it yet so i ca n't actually give a review of its performance i can however say that the transaction was wonderful i did n't have to pay any shipping and the item was received in 3 days ! great transaction
exactly what i expected good service by amazon good price shipped quickly and the fryer seems to be even better heats quicker larger capacity than the old frydaddy many years old which i dropped and broke i 'm very satisfied
as a former owner of a presto fry daddy and grandaddy i expected more of the same high quality and got it ! not only is this the largest one to date but the fastest the oil is up to full temperature a full 2 or 3 minutes quicker then the other two about 10 minutes total does a great job of cooking just try not to overload it or foam over ! great quality and price a best buy
it is wonderful ! great size for a family just a little bigger than the grandpappy and has a metal divider that slides in the middle to fry two things at one time !
i recently purchased the dualdaddy fryer i have had several different fryers in the past i started about ten or so years ago with the original grandaddy it was alright but i wanted to be able to fry more and had seen the newer fryers that had covers while you were frying i bought one and it was great for frying and the cover kept the spattering to a minimum however it was very pricey and a major job to clean if i 'm going to take the time to clean something i want it very clean with the big ones you have to really take it all apart to get it good and clean the day before i bought the dualdaddy i spent over an hour trying to get the old one clean and finally gave up and threw it out i really like the dualdaddy it is a great size and very simple to clean in about fifteen minutes i can drain the oil wash the fryer and refill i bought one of those fine screen mesh spatter guards that you put over skillets for a dollar and it works great on top of the fryer the only thing i wish this fryer had was a light to let you know when the power is on and when the oil is up to temp other than that i really like this fryer it comes to about 350 degrees in under fifteen minutes and holds it 's temp quite well
we bought this deep fryer around 3 years ago and it is still working great ! we received a fancier deep fryer for a gift but the fancy one never seems to get hot enough this deep fryer has never given us any problems
i read some of the previous reviews on this product and it seems it works very good or not at all in my case it works amazingly well i have two bengal cats neutered male and a female i want to breed in about a year well the female came in to heat she was making some really weird noises day and night she started wetting on the floor and then on my bed ! i called the vet who recommended feliway i went to the pet store and bought one i came home and plugged in the diffuser went to work came home a few hours later both cats had undergome personality changes for the better they were both much calmer more affectionate and playful no more weird noises no more wetting that 's when got on amazon and bought four more diffusers to put through out the house but i have n't had to use them yet i 'm waiting for a version for humans
my tomcat marks his litter box 1 or 2 times every day and he does not cover the marking thank god that is the only thing he marks he started doing it after he got declawed 3 months ago i was hopping this product would help it did n't ! he still bombs the poor litter box every day but in the other hand he seems to be friendlier calmed and less stressed compared to a week ago i bought two and i still have some hopes maybe he 'll stop his smelly habit soon
i 'm the president of a cat rescue group for ragdolls while it 's hard to tell if it works on some cats we 've had great success using this with aggressive scared ones we can tell when it 's getting low from the actions of one aggressive cat in particular it 's definately worth trying !
this is kind of a tough review to write because i did n't buy it for myself but rather for a friend whose cat is 17 years old and has been keeping her up all night howling the vet ca n't find anything wrong with the cat thyroid checked out fine that would cause the howling but i heard that as they get old cats can get senile too another friend of mine bought this stuff for her cats and she said they are much more relaxed and less uptight especially whenever a visitor is over she had one cat that used to hide under the couch the whole time anyone was there but now it just lays there on the floor like a big bearskin rug without a care in the world anyway the friend i bought the stuff for said that her cat is n't starting the howling until after before it started around 11 am so if it 's really helping she 's grateful because she 's getting a little more sleep based upon that and my other friend 's comments about how it 's made her cats less nervous i think it 's a good product to try if your cat has issues that ca n't be pinpointed to any medical problems
my cat has always been high strung and just plain mean she growled hissed slapped bit you name it so when someone recommended feliway to calm her down i decided to try it but i did n't hold out much hope i plugged it in in the master bedroom her domain and saw an immediate difference oh she still growls sometimes but she is much more loving and affectionate and seems calmer great product ! !
this product has been a miracle for my cat w adopted her several years ago and we were warned that she was feral for years she peed on our furniture at least a couple times a month she stayed very thin about five pounds just barely eating enough to stay alive and she would n't let my husband pet her at all picking her up was not an option we had just about given up when we found this product i noticed a change in her almost instantaneously when we put one in our house she now allows us to hold her she eats more and weighs a much healthier 8 pounds she does n't hide from my husband she actually lies down and purrs for loving and she has n't peed on anything since we started using this product about 8 months ago i use two in my house
this is a great set ! ! no problems easy to wash and leaves no rust stains from the dishwasher like most other flatware
this product was well worth it i use it everyday and i 'm very happy with it i recommended it highly for a everyday set thanks
it 's a great set for the price they withstand our many dishwasher sessions without losing their shine the only gripe is if oneida can embed a gps tracking device in them so we can track them down when they 're mysteriously gone missing
this is a pretty good vacuum cleaner if you have a limitted budget and your floor is covered by carpet i can suggest this product i know it is not the best for cleaning carpets but it works since it is bagless you do n't have to worry for buying bags but its nozzle and other accessories look like toys
this dirt devil picks up better than the one i bought in 1998 but the longer cord on the 1998 model made it easier for me to clean parts of my home also since i have allergies having to dump the dirt out and bang the hepa filter on the side of the garbage can is a problem it was healthier for me with the 1998 model to put the disposable bag into the trash environmentally the new one makes less trash which i do like
i have a vacuum on each of 3 floors both upright and canister in the past 3 years i have replaced all the canisters with the breeze bagless canister great suction and light weight could n't be more pleased in fact i have purchased one for my and two for my daughter
this is a wonderful little machine extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver but with amazing suction power ! it also has a feature to quickly and easily lessen that power with a quick flip of a small tab to easily vacuum blinds and curtains lots of great attachments i absolutely love this little vacuum cleaner plus the filter makes it easy to quickly empty and you do n't have to mess with bags i love it ! i give it 2 thumbs up
the low price and good reviews are what lead me to buy this vacuum it is lightweight does a good job on hard floors the suction for carpets does n't seem that great it does not pick up any lint on my area rugs if you have mostly hard flooring then this is a good pick would not recommend for carpets though
after purchasing a second home with tile floors and carpet we looked at several different brands of smaller vacuums we have experience with the dirt devil breeze in our other home and appreciate these features vacuums well light weight and easy storage
a great vac for the money we used uprights for years but this one much easyer to use especially for our house which has all wood light and follows you around as you go
i have a small home with mostly tile floors and wanted something that is quick efficient and does n't take up a lot of precious storage space i feel the dirtdevil is a good product in the class of it does fine on the tile the cannister needs to be changed after each use but it does n't do as well on my area rugs i like the upholstry attachments and it is quick and efficient to use and store
this is the perfect glass for everyday very sturdy glass but is not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold i liked these glasses so much that i ordered an extra set to assure that i will not have less than a set when some get broken very reasonably priced but expensive shipping
i have been looking for this pot for quite a bit was i happy to find it on this web site ! the price was right and the shipping was super fast ! ! ! the crabs never tasted better ! ! ! ! jim dunca
works as advertised a bit larger than anticipated but otherwise has met my expectations i have n't had any issues with the filtering if you do n't need a large capacity check out 's smaller capacity i mostly fry fish chicken french fries onion rings and occasionally
overall this is a great fryer the one issue i have is that the filtering system will clog if you use fish fry such as zatarain 's the oil will not drain into the storage container because the fish fry will clog the filtering system i have used my fryer numerous times and this has always happened
i recommend this fryer i have had other fryers in the past and highly recommend this one easy to use and extremely easy to clean as well as storing the oil frys food quickly and parts go right into the dish washer
my wife and i ordered this ez clean deep fryer by because of it 's features such as the filtration cleaning system now we followed the direction to a tee and the outcome was nothing less than ! ! the oil heated up in minutes and even when adding the frozen items to cook it stayed to temperature ! and had the fastest cooking speed for a home fryer we had ever used ! we cooked 4 breaded haddock squares in 6 minutes to perfection and then french fries in about 3 minutes or so then we let it set about 3 hours or so for the oil to cool and then used the ez clean it worked ! ! not one problem and not even a drip spilled we have had a few deep fryers over the years and i 'm here to tell you this is the best hands ! none has even come close we highly recommend this ! but understand it is very big so we do suggest that you have the counter space and follow the directions
i have gone through several deep fryers over the past few years in my quest to find the perfect deep fryer the ultimate ez clean is hands down the best i have found to date the pros so easy to clean ! most of the unit is dishwasher safe which is a great plus for me the thing i hated about deep fryers before was cleaning the oil from the system either the inner pot would not be removable in the days when deep fryers first came out and started to become popular or the pot would be full of the junk from the food and it would be hard to pour out and filter the oil also where to store the oil this unit makes it so easy to clean and reuse the oil it does a great job of filtering out the junk that has floated into the oil from frying and neatly storing it into the storage container it 's about time someone came out with a product like this ! the cons it does use a lot of oil so you have to buy the big gallons from costco or warehouse type of place the good thing though is the ease of reusing the oil so it does n't make it seem too bad to use that amount of oil also i wish the oil would heat higher than 378 degrees i did n't get out a cooking thermometer to actually see if the oil heated to that temp but it would be nice if the oil got hotter i can understand that it is for home use and not professional so there is a safety factor but frying at a higher temperature for fries ensures a fry overall i love this deep fryer so i gave it a five even though it does have a few things it could improve upon
this deep fryer lives up to the hype you can actually clean the old oil out completly and have a fresh container to work with on the next frying this means everything when you are looking for that taste that comes only from fresh oil cooking the best i have ever used j
i have owned several other brands of fryers and let me tell you this one exceeds any expectations i had it is durable and well designed and the feature works better than i could have imagined i have to admit that i was skeptical about draining the oil into the plastic drain pan and then attempting to pour the oil back into the metal frying bin the process ended up being so simple that my kids can do it without making a mess the only thing i will say to be watchful for is to make sure the drain is cleared following filtering this does not present a hazard of any kind but having to reach your hand back down into the oil or pour it out into another container manually to clear fried particles is pretty messy the directions for doing this are clearly written in the booklet without question the best fryer i have ever owned i am buying one for my folks
i love how the fryer works and looks it is named ez clean but that is n't true yet somehow the seal leaks on the oil drain button the oil leaked terribly when i drained the oil for the next several times i used the fryer i left the oil in the basin it slowly leaked out and was a huge mess on my counter i did n't see the oil at first so i ruined my sweater i have put paper towels under to monitor the leak and i emailed customer service just now i hope they can help it is the best fryer i 've tried and i love the look
this is a cheap lightweight pan if thats what you 're looking for buy it if you want heavier metal move on
this was a fun gift for my groomsment the product works great and i got a great deal on it thanks
i am amazed at the negative reviews on the rabbit i 've had mine for almost two years with no problems at all yes it is about time to replace the screw as the teflon coating will wear the only reason the rabbit does n't get 5 stars is that it chokes on synthetic stoppers about the only thing that works for these is the puller our rabbit does about 10 corks a week and up to 50 in a wine party evening once you get in the the flow of the operation it is a breeze for those who have problems with the rabbit simply send it to me then stick with screw caps as most other pullers would likely pose a similar challenge
i purchased the rabbit '' for my husband this christmas we used to uncork wine with a typical waiter corkscrew '' we are not waiters and would inevitably spill wine break corks and feel like idiots it took a few bottles of practice to feel like a pro using the metrokane rabbit it 's really a cool system i 've watched my husband open a bottle of wine in 10 seconds flat my advice be patient learn the machine and after a few tries you 'll be uncorking effortlessly
this is my third unit each one works great it is very easy to install they even provide several adapters to cover most models of faucets use some teflon tape when installing and do n't tighten with anything other than your fingers do this and the unit connection will last a long time i also got a plastic swivel aerator from home depot that makes this just perfect too bad they did n't think of that the filter indicator light is a nice feature so you do n't have to remember when you replaced it last it let 's you know when to replace the unit i always keep an extra filter on hand it 's great for coffee and tea less frequent cleaning of the coffee pot and no build up in the tea kettle the water tastes great too i am a little concerned about amazon 's business practice with this purchase the contents were previously opened the components were complete and a new filter was included but the parts were loose if they had n't left the opened bags in the box i might not have known i would assume the manufacture was sloppy in packaging the bags the parts came in were opened and the parts were loose within the box
i purchased this in lieu of a pitcher system it is easy to install and the led indicator for the filter is fantastic no guessing when the filter needs to be replaced i have not used other faucet filtering systems but this one is easy to install and makes nyc water taste better i have been using this filter for 8 months now without any problems
i used it with a duvet and find it very light and comfy others complain about its crinkly noise i find the crinkly noise very pleasant for 20 you ca n't go wrong
it was great for the price and keeps you nice and snugly you will have to use it for a bout a week to break it in but after thats its pure wonde
i bought this for my husband and ended up giving him the old comforter to use and i took this one its light keeps you warm and it has the krinkly sound to it my cats and i love it great buy and good for the price
my mother liked this comforter so much i had to order her her own at 19.99 it was a stea
this was a huge deal on a king size down comforter i have always wanted one but did n't want to spend so much for fear i would n't like them however this one is of great quality and we love it ! ! great service great price great product thanks
got one for myself and one for my son with no high expectations i wanted to get away from electric blankets without adding weight this did that job superbly light as the feathers within it warms up fast and i sleep marvelously in the comforter cocoon wish i 'd bought it years ago
i 've had alot of ice cream makers and this one is the best of all it 's the fastest and easiest to use and the recepies are the best of 's no scalding of the milk and you do n't even need a you need is a wisk and pour the mixture in and in 12 to have the most delicious ice cream you 've ever tasted
i 've been looking at quite a few canisters and these are about the best around they hold a shine and are easy to clean thank
i adore this coffee maker ! i 've read the reviews and i 've used one not mine for seven months daily all with no problems the owner of the machine i am using warned me to make sure to push in the filter door until it clicks firmly before assuming it was ready to brew she stated that she had had a problem with the filter only once and she was smart enough to figure it out and never had another problem if i had any complaint about this system at all it would be that when it begins the cycle at the grinder wakes up everyone in the house when i know that i have to get up that early i just grind the beans myself the night before no big deal i love this item and am here to purchase one for myself i 'm buying a reconditioned one because somebody else could n't figure it out sent it back and i 'm only going to pay half the price because i 'm smart enough to know how to close the filter door ! funny how it is the manufacturer 's problem every time a consumer is too limp to read directions here 's your sign
i was skeptical after reading the reviews on this grind and brew but not only is it beautiful looking it is easy to use and brews a superior cup of coffee i 've used it many times and have not had a problem so far in 2007 this is the best item i have bought and it 's a steal at the price do n't pass it up ahhh a cup is brewing now
i was very pleaased with the product and shipping time at half the retail price i would recommend this to everyone
after reading the many reviews on the i was worried about my purchase i have now used the coffeemaker and put it through many i have found the coffeemaker to be an excellent product and it makes a great coffee is easy provided that it is done soon after brewing it is obvious that many of the reviewers have the culinary and mechanical aptitude of a chimp and should revert to making coffee in a 2 gallon can over and open fire or stay out of the kitchen !
this coffee maker makes excellent coffee it is easy to clean and keeps the coffee warm and tasty for several hours i did not have any difficulty using it nor does mine leak at all the only criticism i have is that the grinder is extremely loud it can be a rude awakening if you have it set to automatically make coffee in the morning this is without a doubt the nicest coffee maker i have ever owned
this is by far the best cup of coffee i 've ever brewed hands down ! i debated a long time on buying this machine especially with all of the bad reviews ultimately the price of this refurbished unit was the deciding factor in giving the cuisinart a try i 'm so glad i did after reading the directions carefully unpacking the box and running a water only '' cycle i made my firt pot delicious ! ! i used starbucks coffee and a paper filter since the refurb does not come with the gold filter i have ordered it and ca n't wait for it to come not much maintainence like others have complained about yes you have to rinse everything and leave the top open to dry but i expected that and its really not a problem it 's worth it to taste that great cup of coffee ! ! oh and it was packaged nicely in a box that would be fine for it is labeled refurbished but that is to protect the company against unauthorized i 'm sure a
so far this toaster seems to be living up to the expectations i had for it it toasts pretty evenly it 's easy to clean and the bagel function works well too it 's big but that certainly does n't take away from it 's performance
this toaster has simple finite controllable dials which produce perfect toasting the cleanup is simple the look is sleek and the results are wonderful
i tried several toasters before finding this one all four people in our family like our toast waffles and bagels toasted differently and this delonghi is making us all happy ! it toasts the cut side of a bagel and leaves the rounded side chewy and warm it 's soo good ! the toaster is fairly compact and light yet sturdy and well made get it
well i read the reviews on the toaster and then i decided to buy it ! i am very happy with this beautiful toaster and how well it works my toast is perfect everytime and if i can start my day out with a perfect peice of toast and good coffee i am a happy camper ! reviews really lead the consumer in the right direction i love shopping on the interent and i am very pleased with amazon !
it works great looks great my mother called it a futuristic robot turtle it does take up quite a bit of counter space but the larger size keeps it from getting terribly hot when i 've used it that 's actually great after making alot of toast it does n't burn me when i slide it back in it 's corner the only thing that takes some getting used to is the need to push the button to get your toast early i guess alot of the more expensive toasters are like this so it 's not really a problem just an observation
not only a great looking toaster but works like a charm and its easy to clean which is great with 3 kids thank you
it 's wonderfull toast bread evenly nice size and looks great on ones counter
we purchased two of these toasters we 've been using the first one for about a year and have been completely satisfied usually we hide our small appliances under the counter but this toaster so classy in its retro way that we keep it out all of the time we just purchased the second one as a wedding present so hope the newlyweds like it as much as we do
very well made wood is solid and sturdy i like the recessed handles on each side makes for easy lifting
i needed a cutting board that caught the juices i had one for large turkey dinners but needed a newer one for small roasts this is perfect ! does n't slide on the counter always a plus
i bought this board as a christmas present for my and he loves it ! his criteria for a new board included reasonable size so he could bring it to the table and a trough and well to catch meat juices this board has those attributes plus it is well made with small rubber feet to hold it secure while carving and handles carved into the underside of the board so it can be carried easily to where ever you like i looked at every carving board on amazon and on many other websites many were nice but none had all of the features i 've mentioned plus a very reasonable price ! i would not hesitate to recommend this board by the way there is no one on the web that has the selection of carving boards you find on amazon thanks amazon
after getting poor results from a steam driven krups i decided to give home espresso brewing another try with a pump driven machine after many days of research i settled on the villaware moderno in addition to good reviews it was the only pump machine in this price range that did not have a boxy or plastic look all in all i a very happy with my purchase the machine heats up fast its easy to use and the foamer is fool proof i steamed half and half for my cappucino and got mountains of very stable foam on the first try ! for espresso i used the illy pods that came with it and got very satisfactory results the espresso was plenty hot and had a moderate amount of crema but i understand that you get less crema anyway if you use pods the hot water dispensing feature also works fine i dispense the hot water into a large pyrex measuring cup for preheating the espresso cups some things worth mentioning cleaning in addition to washing everything with soapy water i ran 4 tanks of water through the system before i could get rid of that metallic smell '' definately run water through the steam nozzle before using it i noticed little particles of stuff coming out in the rinse water dripping yes the portafilter does drip after you stop brewing but i shove a shot glass under the spout after i remove the cup and no problem
this machine is awesome ! the thermostat is accurate and helpful the crema is in abundance without the crema enhancer '' piece i read many reviews from others on different site 's some not so good they are wrong this machine makes superior espresso i just returned from italy in february i 've tasted espresso from the best machines this one rivals them all ! the tamper is fine it 's plastic but i noticed that in italy they did n't really use them the way you might think it just compacts the coffee down and smooth 's it the steamer works perfectly yes there is dripping afterwards but rather than extra cleaning up i just place a paper towel or cloth to absorb the drips no problem the cup warmer is n't much help oh well in italy they did n't warm the cups anyway follow the instructions remove the crema enhancer you do n't need it and enjoy do get a conical bean grinder it 's best
i have used de longi and coffee espresso makers but the villa ware is the best one yet the difference between the espressos is notable i recomend to use fresh grind coffee beans and you will see this espresso machine from villa ware not only looks beautiful but you will get the best espresso experience love it
we have worn out three other espresso machines this one seems to hold up to our household 's daily demand cups per day it is very and its design is quite nice my biggest gripe is the filter is small and i have n't been able to find to purchase extra filters if you 're looking for a good personal espresso machine this is it
i was very happy with the espresso and the looks of this machine i used it several times a day for about 2 weeks first complaint it drips alot after you remove the portafilter i read other reviews with the same complaint second complaint the handle came off of the portafilter after about 2 weeks of heavy home use even with my 2 complaints i was still very happy with this machine i contacted villaware first to see if i could get a portafilter they were friendly and said it was still under amazon warranty and i had to contact amazon i contacted amazon and sent it back to get a replacement machine they were unable to send me a replacement at the time so they refunded my money amazon was great to work with currently i 'm doing some research and will buy a more expensive unit from amazon
had the machine for 1 month now will be back in 6 months to rate any reliability aspects it makes great espresso all crema works equally well with pods and powder coffee powder container has a locking feature to help dispose of used powder without loosing the powder cup water container needs to go under pump hose so attention needed when placing it on the machine not bad though temperature meter works well i have not tried cappucino drinks but looks straightforward this machine is beautiful form and function all the way
okay i will be honest i am a big espresso cappuccino latte tea drinker who spends average of 30 daily at starbucks my francisfrancis ! broke a couple of months ago and i was looking for something almost equal to replace it i am from europe and grew up on good coffee espresso and cappuccino i ordered this machine just because i used to own a pasta maker by villaware it was outstanding therefore i wanted to give this one a try i received my box earlier this evening and prepared my first shot it was excellent the crema on the top was smooth enough to retain the sugar inside its heavy and solid and produces and great foam 15 bar it looks like my francis hopefully it will last longer than it ' it also comes with a box of illy pods great deal you will not regret
i was getting sick of teflon pans coming apart scrape them with metal and they peal apart this pan is great it 's very light strong and great all around a great buy !
cant go wrong for the money its hours of fun and good for the cat joh
i have bought two different brands of these same result the kitty really likes to chase and jump for it my kitty will fight you for it he digs his claws in and it is a battle to get it back they are usually colorful and appealing to the cat they are also usually different lengths most have longer plumes in the center to catch your cats eye wiggle it and they will play forever another toy most younger cats enjoy for the playfulness and for their good health and excercise
cat 's love love love this toy ! ! if you know of a you have to buy this as a gift if a cat does n't like it surely they have to be this is the best toy and will give your cats wonderful exercise you also get to laugh as they make mid air flips over and over again you wo n't be disappointed do n't buy anything else !
i bought this after i read it was recommended by the author of cat cat '' i have 3 cats a prissy female an obese lazy female and a psychotic energetic male i love this thing ! i am so amazed and very happy that all 3 of them love this toy ! my cat usually never plays with cat toys only strings pens and straws my fat cat just never plays but is obsessed with watching out the window and talking to birds the male however was born in a feral cat colony but bottle fed by my he has endless energy before i even got da bird out of its package he was excited the other two were sleeping we started playing and soon the fat one came downstairs to see what was going on before long i had my two females playing with it having put the male in a room the only thing you might want to consider is if you have a cat who is over possessive or wild may destroy the feathers before a normal cat would my male cat was so nuts over this he actually was tiring himself out to the point of panting the problem is when he would actually catch da bird he will not let go and growls so the other cats do n't want to play really if you think about it wild cats and some domestic catch birds then take them off to eat but as long as you do n't allow them to get to aggressive with it you should be fine i definitely recommend this toy be sure you keep this somewhere your cats ca n't find it when you are n't playing with them
finally a cat toy that my cat actually loves ! i just tried da bird out for the first time today and my kitty loved it i was looking for a way to give my indoor cat some extra exercise and i think i found it i had read alot about this cat toy but i was really skeptical as to whether or not it would live up my expectations i figured i had nothing lose though and decided to give it a try and i could n't be happier if you 're looking for a way to have fun with your cat and give him a workout then you got ta try da bird
i recently got my cat boris this toy he loves to chase and tackle the feathers and really gets a good work out when we play with it overall it is a great toy for cats with one drawback however the rod is made with fiberglass and boris chewed on the end of the rod when i picked it up my hand received lots of tiny fiberglass splinters which are very painful and impossible to see to get out once the pole was wrapped in duct tape it worked great so a good product but keep the pole part away from your cat and your hand
we 've been using toys like this for a couple of years now they 're all wonderful and da bird is no exception just like you can see in the customer pictures cats will leap flip charge sneak ambush and kill the feathers on the featherstick with total abandon and it is total so be careful where you play with it your cats wo n't be beyond leaping into the air and coming down hard on something that 'll hurt them for indoor cats especially this toy is truly invaluable exercise and hunting are great for stress relief and health for kitties and da bird is a wonderful way to give them both by the time our kitty 's chased this thing down for a few minutes she 's gasping for breath and well exercised it 's not just a toy it 's a healthy for your indoor kitty ! when you buy it though make sure to pick up some spare feathers after the feathers have endured too much abuse they just wo n't fly and flutter the way they did new and although our cat still likes them they do n't excite and captivate her the way fresh feathers will new feathers transform it into a whole new toy though highly recommended for anyone who likes to play with their cat and doubly for anyone who wants to give their indoor cats a good and some great exercise
i bought one of these at a cat show about 6 years ago and have never regretted it this thing absolutely memerizes my kitties and is an update i bought a replacement set of feathers and within a week my cats had torn them out of the holder i guess the quality went down
my cats absolutely love this toy ! ! ! one of the best toys out there next to the cat play cube and the new automatic laser pointer i found at petco
i love this timer besides the fact that it matches all of my other red kitchenaid items i love that it is heavy duty easy to use and loud i 've read that the timer is too quiet but they must have fixed this attribute because it is loud enough for me to hear from the other side of the house it is easy to set also i suppose if you 're in a major rush maybe it would take too long to set but for normal cooking i can spare the 10 seconds to set it
cute little pudge looks just like the charactor from star wars i bought a new stove and it gives one little buzz and then stops i was burning too many cookies so i bought the kitchenaid timer after years of plastic junk i am very happy to have a quality timer it is completely enclosed with no crevices so you can pick it up with your gunky hands and just wipe it off when you 're done it has an ingenius way of activating but as soon as you get the hang of it it becomes second nature it rings long and loud which makes me happy
i find this timer very easy to use i 'm not a rocket scientist i have never been disappointed with kitchen aid i do n't understand why it has gotten bad reviews i think some people should stick with a sun dial
the most quiet air pump i have ever owned i was a faithful customer of hagen and tetra air pumps but got fed up with the noise then i tried rena my rena air pump has been running for 3 years without any problem the pump is powerful enough to generate a curtain of air bubbles using long difusers the air flow is adjustable
i own many pans but still found this pan an excellent value for money the build quality is excellent another reviewer mentioned that he received a pan that must have been a mistake the one i received is brand new and the cooking efficiency is better than much more expensive stainless steel pans also the pan is not very heavy so handling is not difficult also it works on all cooktops including induction this pan does not come with a lid so you may have to order the lid separately overall i am very impressed with this item
this bowl is very durable and i love the different colors that it comes in the bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times we basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream popcorn nachos etc i love these bowls and am going to buy a set of fiestaware for my mom
i like and dislike these bowls what i like about them is the shape and size for certain foods and for the dishwasher they are actually too small for cereal if you would like to add fruit to your cereal they are perfect for oatmeal or ice cream but too small for soup or stew they are curved perfectly to drain and rinse well in the dishwasher the depth of color is very attractive on the table
this is a great size for ice cream salsa etc the shamrock is a beautiful color
these bowls are really great i have been watching and learning about fiesta for a long time this was my first fiestaware purchase i will be getting more ! !
these are the coolest little bowls i 've ever seen i bought them for my mom for christmas last year and they are extrememly useful i got them in tangerine which is a very bright sunny orange color we use them for everything from cereal to candy and nut dishes i highly recommend these bowls
these bowls are nice perfect for soup dessert salad or whatever well i like big salads so they 're a little small for my salads but they 're great for a lot of things and i swear you could drop them on the floor and they probably would n't break they fit nicely on the small fiestaware plates so you do n't spill a full bowl of soup they go in the fridge to store leftovers in the dishwasher i 've washed these things hundreds of times and they 're still in great shape and probably in the freezer too if only fiestaware would make lids so i 'd feel more comfortable putting these in the freezer for storing things as they are i have to use plastic wrap which always lets in yucky freezer smells
you just ca n't go wrong with fiestaware it 's sturdy durable attractive cleans up easily from table to dishwasher to cabinet and if my family ca n't break it no one can
i purchased this diamond sharpening steel from amazon and have used it for a couple of days it really works superb and overall performance is above all expectations it not only realigns the edge but sharpens it as well it removes material steel in infinitesimal amount that accumulates on the surface of the tool as extremely fine dust it takes only a few effortless strokes for simple edge realignment if the knife is sharp or few minutes of work if the knife is dull but in any case the result is amazing ! once in a while this diamond sharpening steel should be put under running water for only a few seconds for cleaning and steel dust residue flushes with water maintenance is simple and easy so whether you have cheap knives or expensive ones this tool is worth the money the only issue i leave open is durability of this diamond sharpening steel theoretically it should last forever but in reality it remains to be seen
i like the design and handling of this spoon it is a little bit shorter than average but that does n't bother me it is comfortable in the hand sturdy and attractive it 's great for serving veggies i know it will last me and probably future generations for many years to come
this has decreased the amount of screeching battles between my male cat and new arrival quite a bit the new one still does not like him but the old cat does n't seem to stalk the new one as much and he has significantly reduced his spraying to mark his territory
each year we board my mother 's cat while she is on vacation and each year so far she has gotten a urinary tract infection from holding in her urine for the first few days we also get issues with one of my own cats scent marking clean laundry and bedding this year my mother 's cat never got a uti and we have n't had one single scent mark from the other cat it has n't eliminated all the tension that exists between the cats but it definately makes the visit easier to bear
within 10 minutes of plugging this in it turned my maine coon attack cat into a pansy i can now pet is stomach without losing an arm he is much more affectionate and passive works for me
it apparently works but not completely the price is good in comparison with prices in pet shops however i think it is very expensive for the contain of the product
we recently moved into our house with a parade of contractors still coming in and out and the stress of moving the youngest of our two cats began spraying in the room in which their litter box resides we bought both the feliway spray and the room plugin we sprayed the litter box room and used the plugin out in the room he spends most of his time in now both boys had also begun to hiss at each other and not spend any time together with the use of the spray and plugin not only did duncan stop spraying but he and yenta now play and sleep together again also both boys are now very affectionate please note if you 're buying the product to stop spraying be sure to get all the smell out of the affected areas we used spray to clean and remove the urine all of these products were and have saved our new home
this is a great roasting rack however i bought it to go in my small roasting pan and it does n't fit makes a set that you can buy unfortunately i purchased my pan many years ago
i bought the roasting rack and used it in a 40.00 roaster not the ! ! it was a great investment i got all the advantages but did not have to pay the exorbitant cost of the roaster i have tried it once so far and it worked great the investment
this rack came with my brand new all clad roasting pan i was hesitent at first because the majority of the ones i see are rather poorly made and look like they will collapse while the turkey is cooking not to mention a royal pain to clean up this rack is so sturdy ! it is one piece so you do n't have to worry about it collapsing also the non stick on it is truly wonderful it cleaned right up in no time i will now faithfully use this rack
i love this rack i use it in the stainless roti pan it 's great for your holiday turkey or roast it keeps the meat out of the drippings and lets it cook on all sides clean up is quick and easy and makes life a little easier at holiday time
i ordered these after i did n't see them anymore at walmart they are great because they store alot of stuff i have fabric cat litter my niece 's stuff for when she comes to visit and save space because it 's upright and the casters make it even more you can store them somewhere and just move them around as needed great and pretty much worth the money ! watch the arrived broken up and i do n't know why they wanted me to return waste of my time i did n't and now they want to charge me something i could n't nor could anyone else use
this was a gift for my parents who wanted to entertain using this
best raclette grill ever ! ! ! it works great and it 's nonstick so clean up is super easy ! i would recommend it to all of my friends
we decided last minute that we wanted a raclette grill for our christmas dinner and the model i rally wanted was not available any longer so this was our second choice but we love it it worked perfectly you do n't need a temperature adjuster this is such a fun way to entertain for the whole family not just on special occasions in short easy easy preparation fun cooking for the whole family easy clean up even works for picky eaters we have raclette twice a month now with the kids
recently my wife and i used this grill during a new year 's celebration we were going to have eight guests but instead only six were able to come ultimately we were glad for that considering it would have been quite cramped had we had eight people using the grill if you plan accordingly however that is not a problem we are very satisfied with grill we used the top surface to grill some meats and vegetables even though it was used for a while and therefore had a lot of burnt on residue it was easy to clean also the trays for the cheese were easy to use the cheese slides of really well and the trays and scrapers were also easy to clean as long as you do n't allow the cheese to bake on all in all we are very happy with it and just need to find more excuses to use it a small suggestion authentic raclette cheese is a must
this is a great change of pace way to grill my family loved the do it yourself '' aspect we just put it on the table and we each grilled our own meal the only thing is that the sauses got too hot when left in the trays and were messy to pour out hot otherwise it was easy to clean and to use
i bought this raclette grill for my wife thinking that it would just be another kitchen gadget that we never used wow what a great way to have an intimate dinner it 's perfect to enjoy a relaxing meal with adults i guess you could entertain a larger group if you do n't mind getting your fixins close to each other ! if you 're use to eating a fast meal in front of the tv then you should try raclette it really makes you slow down and enjoy the meal we bought some very inexpensive miniature wooden tongs from a chinese supply store that work very well for taking your food on and off the grill surface i had to subtract a star just because calling it an 8 person grill is a bit of a stretch
works great ! i like the temperature control i have an older european model with only an switch and i must say the temp control is much better we only do raclette maybe twice a year so i ca n't speak to the durability of the product
good grinder i have used it since i got it and it works to my expectations which by the way is not that of a professional butcher i cut for my family that is all works great for the amount of grinding and cutting that i do
lightweight easy to use only critisim is that the filter is hard to get all the dust out o
i just love my little eureka bagless it 's lightweight picks up cat hair and crumbs easily no need to drag out the big heavy one the price is easy compared to the big ones many of which do n't do as good a job ! ! can easily be taken upstairs i heartily reccomend it
wow does this machine get out the dirt ! i went over an area of my carpet that i 'd just cleaned with my old vacuum and it 's as if it had never been vacuumed before this machine is very intelligently designed the attachments are convenient and easy to use the attachment does n't have its own motor but it still does fairly well on stairs etc as others have mentioned the vacuum is heavy and using it is a workout experience which is how i treat it i vacuum a little with each arm and take a break about halfway through my entire house is carpeted i only wish that there were a way to control the amount of suction one can raise the carpet height '' and that helps a little but there 's still too much suction to use on rugs either with the base or with the attachments i would suggest a little valve that one can open somewhere on the shaft that would take care of the problem on the whole though i 'm very pleased with my new vacuum
about the only improvements i can think of would be to make the hose longer for greater reach and to increase the strength of the cord winder that is weak the replacement bags are more expensive because of the convenient design but hopefully the cost will come down when more of them are sold overall it 's a good machine good design great suction ! if you buy it you 'll be happy
i recently purchased a new hoover wind tunnel vacuum when my old hoover died after almost 14 years of flawless service my new vacuum even outperforms my older vacuum i am amazed at all the wonderful features it has automatic cord rewind extensions so i can clean my ceiling fans pet hair attachment etc i am a firm believer in hoover vacuums and would n't own any other brand i even check out the orecks but this hoover is superior to all other vacuums on the market today one satisfied customer ! ! !
i was interested in getting a new windtunnel ii as soon as i found out about them i loved my current windtunnel but i was anxious to get the updated tools and i wanted a model that had automatic brush when using them i 'm a loyal hoover customer not only my current vaccuum was one but my previous and first ever vaccuum too they have wonderful suction ! so first i bought the red extra reach '' windtunnel ii canister model from target i loved the suction performance and the tools are great and really easy to use the problem was that the surface where the canister attaches to the body is a very large area where the hepa filter '' a paper wheel with deep folds resides this area allows dirt and pet hair to collect on the sides of the pocket which holds this filter then when the canister is removed for emptying this dirt falls out onto the vaccuum body and can be really messy after 3 months of using the machine i found that tons of hair and dirt were stuck in this cavity and could be picked out with my fingers also the powered pet hair tool was very weak and the brushes would stop if the slightest pressure was applied on the that this was a glitch with the one i had i returned that one and ordered the orange complete '' model with all the bells and whistles from this machine was a lot more expensive but also had problems the leakage '' of dirt up next to the filter was immediately apparent plus the embedded dirt finder '' light was n't working completely disgusted with this bagless design and the notorious self cleaning hepa filter '' i decided to return that one and give the bagged windtunnel ii a try lucky for me this machine is free of the design flaws of the bagless hepa filter models the bags are the filtration so that problem is solved plus the bags are inserted and removed really easy and are automatically sealed when removed a sliding plastic top does this so that there 's no mess the tools are the same really easy to access ones as with the previous 2 machines but this time the powered pet hair tool works correctly also the embedded dirt finder '' light functions as it should the only thing is that the belt i think makes a little whine when i lift the machine while it 's running so basically i 'm happy with the performance and still loyal to hoover unfortunately though the '' phenomenon is obviously affecting the manufacture and assembly of consumer goods to the point that although design and technology can be impressive things are n't made to the quality standards that they used to be
this has been the best perc ever used ! and yes of course a few grounds do get into the coffee but that 's to be expected with a perc coffee maker no filter is necessary but could be used if you wanted to this machine is very fast and makes a wonderful cup of joe i also use it to make ice tea perfectly brewed
i ordered this for my husband because he is very picky about his coffee he loves the percolator
this is a great coffee pot i have been searching for the best cup of coffee and this works for that it is really nice and i like the cordless feature
if you 're like me you find it really hard to find good utensils that you can use with your nonstick cookware spoons are the only thing that are good in wood and the plastic stuff seems to crap out on me eventually tongs are worth their weight in gold a spatula or spoon have their uses but they 're not cut out for universal cooking service tongs are good for just about anything that 's not sloppy or squishy it 's like having a heatproof extension of your hand available all you ever see is the standard metals tongs though and those wo n't do unless you 're bbqing or if you cook on stainless or anodized and you ca n't poke a lot in either i did n't want tongs so these fit the bill perfectly they are a good length they do n't open too wide to be a nuisance when placed on a or they 're sturdy they 're great
these are wonderful tongs they work well in and delicate pots and pans due to the silicon tong end they have a sturdy aluminum frame but i would n't attempt to squeeze on them too i have easily picked up a meat roast with them for turning they have a nice large lock at the top and a loop for hanging i removed the loop as i use a utensil holder and found it got in the way for the lock a good job by amco on these
i 've had this set for about 6 months these pans are very good for the money the nostick surface works amazingly well you hardly need any oil in all of your pan frying i was able to stain the inside of one of the sauce pans pretty easily besides that i have n't really found a flaw with this set i also bought the stir fry pan for this set and that has performed up to the standards i have come to expect from these pans
this is the most beautiful pots and pans i have ever used they are wonderful to cook with also they are nice and heavy the handles do get hot sometim so be careful the lids work really well at keeping the heat insde the pot they are not they fry pans are though if you soak them right away and do n't burn your food hte way i do they come clean pretty easy though i hope you enjoy them as much as i do
i bought a rice cooker because i have never been able to make decent rice in a pot yes i know it 's been done for centuries and is supposed to be so easy this rice cooker is exactly what i expected perfection in all but two ways 1 you can make up to 10 cups of rice but not less than 3. i did n't realize that when i bought it i have occasionally made a lot more rice than i needed 2 depending on the rice sometimes the bottom layer of rice gets a little too much heat crispy this does n't happen with japanese rice which is my favorite it does happen with cheap rice it has n't been that big of a deal compared to undercooked or overcooked rice these are minor things
this is a wonderful product it is simple to use economical and cooks rice perfectly just add rice and water push the button down and walk away i use mine atleast 5 times a week
i 've never been able to cook rice but i recently decided to try to recreate a persian rice dish called chelow '' that i love and bought this rice cooker for 19.99 at walmart it could n't be simpler to use just dump in the rice water and push down the cook '' button it made perfect rice the very first time and i 'm really impressed with how delicious it was ! even my husband liked it ! i read a few reviews for other rice cookers here and a lot of people complained that they boiled over but this one did n't it cooked great the pot is and removable for easy cleaning and did i mention the rice was perfect i really like all the black decker kitchen appliances they are very reasonably priced and reliable
it does just what it is supposed to do what more is there to say
i bought one of these a few years ago and put it away until i moved to a new home i just ran across it several months ago i introduced it to my husband who loves using it i bought nine more to give as gifts this past christmas everyone has told me they enjoy using it i like using it it works really well and it is easy to clean
i gave this as a gift to a couple who enjoy cooking together and both love lots of garlic ! they have raved about it and both use it with equal ease i asked if they have any problem using it when needing lots of garlic and they said that the time it takes to clean it out after peeling a few cloves is minimal compared to the time it saves overall not as messy to clean up as some suggest and it is n't one of those gadgets that gets tossed to the back of a drawer and forgotten this couple use it frequently because it works so well
it works in a jiffy dishwasher safe i 've given as gifts it 's so great
love this item specially when i 'm making chicken with 40 cloves of garlic do n't know how i lived without it
this peeler really works i do n't ask how it works it just does everyone should have one avoid having garlic smelling hands
simply put i do n't know how i used garlic before getting the peeler it 's extremely simple in design easily rinsed off and stored and most importantly i get to make dinner without smelling like it ! definitely worth the price
kitchenaid introduced their cutlery line at the same time i was divorcing i left behind a legendary set of knives costing nearly a 1000 dollars i bought these because i had good luck in the past with the handtools and did n't have a lot of money to spend i have been amazed with these knives and would never consider anything else i am a retired chef and have used every brand of knife known to the professional world and these hold their own
this is a really great product especially for the price i do wish it was just a tad bigger though
pleased item brand new and shipped in a timely manner i do wish it was bigger grand pappy '' through me off thought it would be bigger than it was but it was still what i wanted most important vendor delivered as promised
i 've had one of these for years one improvement is the magnetized cord attachment otherwise it 's the same good 'ole reliable deep fryer more efficient than a skillet wth much less fuss and splatters
it 's hard to have much to say about such a simple device this is number five or six from presto they 've all worked great and lasted well past my efforts to keep them clean keep them coming
this item is everything it claims and more unable to locate this item locally deep frys very well the size is perfect for a family and it is very easy to store the oil stays in the fryer and only needs to be changed when it becomes comtaminated just add oil as needed
this is the family size edition of presto 's popular fry daddy line of fryers i have had my own fry daddy for 6 years now and my grandmother has had hers for over 20. still the same basic quality fryer simple heat and fry it has no lid or filter to filter the smell and prevent splatterlike some of the fancy models this is just plain frying best rules if frozen do n't just drop the item in fast and i tend to use this more in the warmer weather when i can have my windows open if you have a good hood above your stove that can be helpful as well otherwise tasty food quickly i still love my fry daddy its affordable and reliable
this is an excellent basic fryer and longstanding excellent track record from a company you can trust this cooks enough to feed several people and it does it evenly and relatively fast sure it 's no health food but it is nice for a change of pace once in a while does great with fish shrimp french fries chicken strips ect only down side is that unlike newer units this does not have a lid that closes while cooking which would prevent the occasional splash great unit you should like it also
the presto 05411 granpappy electric deep fryer is as easy to use as 123. plug it in wait 15 minutes and it 's ready to fry your chicken legs or breast or french fries or any other fryable food in 15 minutes your food is done and your eating nice juicy food the presto granpappy electric fryer is a defenant 5
its is convenient and compact and easy to use it is a procuect i have used for years without any complaints
i ordered 12 of these corelle abundance ramekins and wondered just how much use i would get out of them well after 10 months they are still wonderful ! i use them almost daily for little snack bowls and all kinds of neat ideas when we have guests over each one gets a bowl for baked beans and with hamburgers they are perfect for the possibilities are endless ! i 've even baked little custards in them and they are perfect ! ca n't live without them fast shipping great price
i love these ! ! ordered three sets of these colored for my family and continue to be pleased with the performance they are good quality little used for yogurt ice cream nuts little snacks for the and are microwave oven and dishwasher safe try them for they come in a multitude of different designs kudos !
i bought these as i was trying to find my pattern on the internet i love them ! they are great in the microwave and they match beautifully perfect for a small dish of ice cream or peaches or to put salsa in for snacking
these cups are larger than they appear ! and very strong and sturdy a thick ceramic i use them every day to microwave eggs etc
too bad no photo cute as the dickens ! make sure it says they are in stock when you buy them i got two sets of two i thought by the sound they were broken but they were okay just clanking together worth the wait no instant gratification
absolutely beatiful glasses a bit delicate just make sure they are n't against another glass or object in the dish washer some with smaller hands may find the glass a bit large if so just look to their smaller sized stemless wine glasses
i ordered these without seeing them first and was very pleased with the product the glasses are and have an elegant light feel they are larger than i exepcted but wonderful for letting a red wine open up they shipped with no problems
while i would n't recommend throwing these against a brick wall they are strong enough to survive the average fall without shattering although the glass is nice and thick and solid they are not too heavy and perfect for families our kids can handle them and so can adults we did have one break but in all fairness it fell from the top of a second floor stairway onto a mexican tile floor all the rest of our glases have held up just fine and have survived numerous falls fcrom tv trays and tables if you do n't want to keep replacing your glasses every few months this is the set to have
solid heavy very usable glasses good quality and they go perfectly with the white oneida xxl dinnerware
i own this pattern but in a light blue color is it possible to find this pattern in that color
i ordered and received it right before thanksgiving i put it through it 's paces preparing thanksgiving dinner onions carrots potatoes herbs and the turkey itself and it is as everyone else says a fantastic knife i have never experienced a knife this sharp or this lightweight and i look forward to using this for many years to come
i do regret not buying the granton edge model since the food does stick to the blade when mincing i found that a wood cutting board works better than a cutting mat with such a sharp knife and less food seemed to stick to the blade i have not figured out the technique of thin slicing thick objects like a potato the shape of the knife is different than a chef 's knife and i decided not to use the rocking motion on potatoes rather just draw the knife through there is much to learn also there was a 25 discount on 125 eligible merchandise which reduced the cost
i 'll try to make this really simple and not waste your time i will choose global knives over henkels wustoff or any other traditional european knife why it 's lighter and stays sharper i always sharpen with the global pink and yellow stones and never use it on an automatic knife sharpener nor take it to somebody else it 's important to keep in mind that the blade is formed differently than the european knifes so do n't buy this knife if you 're going to just grind it away on a cheap knife sharpener ! it 'd be a waste of your money and you 're not giving the proper care it needs basically if you take good personal care of this knife it will treat you well for the rest of your life
this was the first global knife i owned and it is the most used in my collection i find it has great balance an excellently sharpened blade and a nice shape for dicing one of the things that i was originally apprehensive about when i bought this knife was amazon 's description of this being for individuals as i am six foot and of average build i have no problems handling this knife it 's a little more slippery than say the chicago cutlery knives i have with wooden handles but the trade off is that it 's easier to clean do n't put it in the dishwasher and looks a lot cooler if you 're serious about cooking and have the coin to upgrade i would go with global 's heavier line these knives are a little more difficult to sharpen than most knives i 've had especially this one with its curved blade the manufacturer says to use a waterstone which i have but i tend to use my electric sharpener which does the job nicely since i 've bought this knife i 've acquired the chef 's knife vegetable knife and the paring knife from this collection and i am happy with all of them
this is the knife i reach for when working with fish vegetables and boneless poultry it is razor sharp light and well balanced in the hand and easy to grip i find the dimpled handle to be quite comfortable most of the time the knife holds its edge well and a few draws across the diamond steel brings it back to a keen edge it is easy to clean with no gaps to catch dirt criticisms a few the blade is delicate and should be well protected when not in use i would stay away from cutting through bone the blade can not handle it the shape is significantly different from european knife designs and takes a little getting used to but it is not difficult when i hold the knife close to the blade the square top edge of the blade digs in to the side of my index finger and that gets old in a hurry so i needed to get used to holding it lower on the handle all in all i rate it five stars '' because once accustomed to the differences between this knife and the european knives this knife performs magnificently its light weight and thin sharp blade make it easy to control and thin consistent slices are made easy
this is a beautiful piece absolutely essential like a surgeon cuts like the very first time
it s the only dissapointment i have thou they are everything the other customers have said and then some ! ! ! ! the 7 quart is next ! ! ! ! overall being made in china the price could have been a little cheaper i like them just the same
i am very pleased with my new stainless steel mixing bowl set it is easy to clean easy to use and looks great too it does an especially nice job with whipping cream and dough the ss gets nice and cold in the freezer
the design is perfect although you want the bowl to be stable on the counter the rounder the inside of the bowl the better and the nearly round bottom is important because then the bowl and the whisk share the same profile enabling the whisk to do its job easily and well these bowls also make good hats
i received these bowls as a wedding present and i love them ! even though they do nest nicely for storage i put up wall pegs for access while i am cooking i ca n't seem to make anything without using at least two of them they hold a chill nicely for working with pastry and pie dough perfect for beating egg whites they hav n't dented even when i have knocked them off the pegs onto the counter and i use a variety of hand mixers in them i wash them in the dishwasher but find that i will hand wash before mixing in another bowl why not 5 stars they could use either a bottom or a rubber to allow for counter mixing sometimes i would like the option for one hand mixing without having to pile up my dish towels price is daunting went to get a set for a friend but almost fell over when i saw the price this is a definite wish list item ! however if the company really stands behind the lifetime replacement gaurantee they might be worth the dough
i bought this heater to put it under my desk at work heats really well and worths the money the only problem that i have observed is that it starts working really silent but after sometime it gets a little bit noisier but that 's all bad about it it cools down pretty fast too
this heater exceeds my expectations it puts out lots of heat and is very quiet i like the fan only feature as well as the thermostat and auto shutoff features additionally i like that the heater grill does not get hot as does most of the ceramic heaters which can get very hot and are not good with children in the house
this honeywell is my favorite ! easy to arrive at your comfort level then cuts off heats efficiently and quietly combo works well in small space or as supplemental heat in large space mine small lightweight and portable seems safe good protective grill design and a larger bottom for stability stays cool to the touch for me this honeywell comes closest to the legendary vornado 100 heater which was rated best overall by good housekeeping 2005 please always exercise caution when using space heaters comparison of 3 honeywell space heaters on amazon honeywell turbo heater fan list 39.99 my overall favorite ! ! i purchased this on a friday sale for 25 including and this has become my favorite space heater heats efficiently and quietly stays cool to the touch the thermostat dial makes it fairly easy to establish a comfort level has power on light nice to find or not trip over in the dark ! lightweight with easy grip for carrying and convenient cord storage i like the combo safety claims auto off hi limit switch motor thermal cut off fuse back up thermal circuit breaker honeywell quick heat ceramic heater list 29.99 heats quickly when dialed to high '' but otherwise short noisy bursts '' ! ! ! best use dial to high constantly on to quickly bring a room to comfort level then unplug it thermostat is basically nearly impossible to establish comfort level finally comes on for 5 seconds then shuts off while air is still chilly has a power on light when plugged in but no off '' setting so has to be unplugged thermostat dial is set right on the ground too low to eyeball when while dialing no carry grip awkward to carry safety claims triple safety protection 3 auto heat sensors honeywell heat express heater fan list 24.99 good for the office but cool spots this honeywell combo seems to leave cool '' spots even when seated right beside it i find myself changing the setting often i do like it for office use as it is a combo with very quiet operation thermostat dial is nice 2 speeds a separate speed plus an off setting very lightweight with convenient carry grip and cord storage safety claims switch thermal circuit breake
blows very warm air far out into the room much better than the other 7 or 8 portable heaters i 've used that only heat the floor for 2 feet controls are easy to use unfortunately mine arrived with a loose fan inside i found one of the screws holding the fan was and broken and the other one was loose this was poor assembly not shipping damage i fixed it rather than returning it and it works well i do n't recommend anyone doing this unless you have electrical expertise and a long safety torx driver for the screws
this is a good little spot heater that will also heat up a small room if you leave it on for 20 mins or so i have some chilly rooms which my central heating will not adequately heat so i purchased this little unit it 's quiet and generates just enough heat to warm up some cold areas such as my area if you have a bigger room to heat or want to use a heater as the primary source to heat up a room this unit is probably not for you this unit also stays cool to the touch as it is double insulated plastic it will shut off if it overheats overall for what it is it 's not a bad unit
i bought these before i read the review below stating that the color was off so i got a plate from my kitchen to compare to the photo above and they look like they match to me i think the photo is a good representation of what you are going to get if you order this item these are a great set for everyday use and the quality is really nice i would recommend them for anyone looking to update their dinnerware with something new and colorful
i have had one of these pots for years using a gas stove top no experience with flat surface though no problems with cooking any large amounts of sauces or spaghetti for the price some of the other issues '' mentioned should be acceptable it still looks like new after years of abuse by my family
the item is of good quality and a good addition to any bar or kitchen
excellent for slicing ripe tomatoes and fruit as well as dinner rolls this is a great little knife to complement a quality set of sharp knives
i really like these easy to clean nothing sticks ! ! they do have a few lines '' on the inside bottom already but i think that 's just normal the holders are excellent !
this is the purchase of a i 've gotten spoiled by how good it is because movie theater popcorn tastes gross to me now strange coating on tonge i pop my own and smuggle it in the recipes that come with it are also fabulous my family likes the sweet touch '' recipe that adds 4 tablespoons of sugar to the oil popcorn and salt
we got this yesterday and it pops the popcorn super fast on our gas stove i was really surprised with how much faster than the microwave it pops up the popcorn we ate 12 quarts for popcorn yesterday SMILE two batches i was unimpressed about how lightweight the pan was it 's super thin but it 's only on the stove for a matter of minutes at a time so it 's not really an issue
my family loves movie theater popcorn and this makes as good if not better popcorn than the theater ! since we purchased it we 've had popcorn every night ! love it ! !
wondeful gift set i am very pleased with the popper and the popcorn works well and taste great
i ordered this item for each of my children for christmas after a friend raved about it they both really liked it so i ordered one for myself the popcorn pops quickly and comes out perfectly the popper is easy to use and comes with recipes for various toppings i recommend this product to anyone who loves popcorn
this popcorn popper is the best ever it makes great popcorn in only a few minutes on the stove now that microwave popcorn is so popular it 's hard to find poppers but this probably the of all is really the best
i bought it for a friend as i have one easy to use never have to clean and almost every kernel pops use less than a teaspoon of canola oil with a of a cup of kernels it 's great
this is a great popcorn popper not only is the popcorn the best but cleanup is a snap will never go back to microwave popcorn
this is the third whirley popcorn popper that i have purchased i give them as gifts to my friends who are true popcorn lovers the popcorn is never greasy always tender and maintains a real popcorn flavor
i love fiestaware ! it is very sturdy durable and the colors are awesome i will definately continue to buy this product
i like my coffee strong and black after years with an inferior machine my wife and i sprung for this unit it does not have all the bells and whistles that more expensive machines have if you just want an honest espresso with a thick crema than this is the machine for you pros it does not take up much counter space the cam action of the portafilter packs the grounds as you twist it closed so all you have to do is screed the grounds with the handy hardwood block that comes with the machine the reservoir is nice because you do not have to add water whenever you use the machine there is no scalding steam off gassing and you can remove the portafilter immediately after you use it for the next brew you can heat your cup with the steam outlet but i prefer to use a microwave to preheat the cup the machine is engineered typically italian with very close tolerances so everything fits snug if you prepack the portafilter then it will not engage the cam this is a very fine machine that is built to last cons like all coffee routines it is a messy process the portafilter '' dribbles on the way to the sink i use a clean dishcloth to hold the portafilter and clean the undersurface of the dispenser the machine uses a lot of electricity so you should not leave it on or your power bill will go up dramatically luckily the machine heats up in under 2 minutes so you can shut it off and on as you need it to save energy
this unit makes great coffee i had a cheaper unit and it did n't extract nearly the amount of flavour from the coffee that this unit does the only gripe i have with this and other coffee machines is that you ca n't fit a good sized mug underneath the portafilter this is a problem with most coffee machines not just this one but aside from that it 's everything you want from a coffee machine highly recommended
this is a great espresso machine better than any i 've had before it 's very forgiving you do n't have to be about what grind you use though burr 3 seems to work best for me and it makes amazing crema every time because of the pressurized portafilter hint make sure you attach the portafilter before you turn on the machine since the aroma releases hot water before you brew the espresso so that the grounds will expand so if you turn it on before you 've attached the portafilter it will start to drip hot water the espresso is rich and incredibly flavorful i use porto rico importing 's italian espresso and the pannarello works perfectly for frothing milk altogether a really great machine
after conducting research for a few weeks visiting amazon as well as other coffee aficionado sites i finally purchased the saeco aroma espresso maker and have been using it for going on two weeks although this machine may not be as glitzy in appearance compared to some machines it does make a great espresso say for instance if the francis francis is the sexy ferrari of espresso machines then the aroma would be a volvo boxy perhaps considered bland in appearance to some but solid reliable and a machine for the price once i got the hang of using the pressurized portafilter which has to be put on tightly to obtain the correct i was treated to rich flavorful espresso with lots of crema i am pleased with the ease of using the machine however the instructions are not very detailed and i found technical support to be slow initially i placed a phone call to where i did not reach a live person but left a message never received a call back but called again the next day at which time i did get a live person to be honest she seemed ambivalent and downright unhelpful blaming my problem on the coffee i was using despite my best efforts to explain the problem the issue was that after priming the machine and installing the portafilter the pump would run and run but no espresso would come out i ended up tightening the three little screws on the bottom of the portafilter which seemed to help make it fit more snugly and achieve a pressurized seal voila ! perfect espresso if i had one complaint about this machine it would be that the portafilter is not very substantial and is made mostly of plastic the aroma 's steam wand works really well for frothing milk almost too well as i ended up with a lot of foam but the second time using it i backed off on the pressure a bit and got just the right balance of milk and foam overall i am pleased with the performance of this machine it 's hard to find a decent machine for under 300 but i would consider this machine to be a machine for an price especially with 15 bars of pressure i had started out thinking i would buy the starbucks barista machine which was almost 400 but after seeing a live demo at a starbucks store realized it did not perform well at only bars of pressure very little crema a good espresso machine should offer a minimum of 14 bars two side notes i urge anyone who purchases an espresso machine to consider a conical burr grinder i bought the capresso 560.01 infinity burr grinder from amazon it 's crucial to have a fine grind for brewing espresso you 'll know when you have just the right grind because after brewing the portafilter basket will contain a compacted cake '' of espresso rather than a soupy mixture of water and grinds i did not purchase my saeco from amazon but opted instead to get it from costco 's website where it was 249 for members or add 5 or 12.45 for nonmembers including shipping and handling plus it could be returned to any costco warehouse within 30 days no questions asked if not satisfied
i did quite a bit of research before buying this machine the aroma delivers in the areas that were of most importance to me it is easy to use easy to clean and makes a wonderful cappuccino there 's very little time it 's ready in only a minute or two to begin making espresso with beautiful crema the steam tube is easy to use and heats the milk while creating a nice thick froth you can make one or many easily i believe the instructions could be a little more comprehensive i left a message at saeco for some clarification on the initial priming that needs to be done before using the machine for the first time or if the machine has n't been used for a long period priming is only necessary at these times my call was returned within one day although i had already worked through the priming the very first cup of espresso took a very long time for the water to begin to drip and flow the machine did not come with the ese pod adaptor and special filter as stated in the description dealt with that on the return call and saeco is sending the adaptor so i 've only had experience using this machine with ground coffee overall i 'm enjoying the ease of the machine and the delicious cappuccino that tastes better than what i can buy at the coffee house i spent a little more than what i originally planned but this machine has the features i wanted powerful pump water tank that is easy to fill at the counter or sink pod adaptable not sensitive to how your ground coffee is prepared very forgiving cup warming surface works well when it 's just me or a houseful of guests and is proving to be well worth the price enjoy
i use this press everyday and have had no problems at all the only way that someone could damage their press is to use metal objects like spoons to steer the mix use water that is too hot i have a 10 coffee maker that 's used for tea but i also use the hot water from it some people put theirs in the microwave not a good idea true you can do it but it does cause long term damage i 've been using the same press for over 2 years it 's only now that i need to buy a new one because i want one for work
i bought this french press to replace a glass one that broke i love that this one has the unbreakable beaker i plan on taking it camping and it 's reassuring to know it 's not going to break coffee out of a french press is the best coffee i 've ever had and i feel excited every time i get to brew it
this plastic press has served me well for over a year now it makes a great cup of coffee and i use it just about every day a piece of the lid did break but it 's still perfectly usable i 'd certainly take this over a glass press for daily use it does n't look pretty but it makes great coffee just like it 's glass cousins
this is not the first french press i have purchased i like that it is unbreakable i just wish it were a little bigger
this coffee press is light weight and easy to use it cleans up easily and takes up little space in the cupboard it works as well as the more expensive ones and it wo n't break if it gets dropped in the sink
it is a very nice piece i broke 1 of 2 from a set so i purchased a new one off amazon no complaints except for the weight slightly too heavy considering it is still fragile like other ceramic serving bowls
i love love love it so does my it took her a while to get use to it cause she is so little and it is kind of big she and my other dogs lounge in it all day it has become a must for visiting others due to we bring maggie and the others every where we plus the fact that it comes in different colors makes it quite ka
i got this crate for my new puppy and i 'm very happy with it very easy to fold up and carry and love the cute pink color
we bought this kennel for our shih tzu puppy and she just loves it the floor mat is soft yet easy to clean and the multiple zippered mesh openings allow us to access her from several sides or roll up the mesh so she can get in and out on her own it comes with handy zippered pockets for toys or treats and one large pocket detaches from the kennel to form a bag with a detachable leash great for travel the kennel is lightweight so it 's easy to move around although we do n't fold it up frequently it was a bit harder to unfold and open up than we expected but once it was open it was very sturdy for a small dog larger or more aggressive dogs might chew through the canvas material so you 'd want to be careful in matching this choice to the temperament of your pet i 'd rate this a 5 if it were n't for that concern
i bought this crate for my shih tzu puppy and it was the perfect purchase for her she 's in and out of it all day love the flexibility of the different openings i usually use the roof '' access and sometimes leave the end panel open so that she can come and go as she likes the only downside is that it does n't have a way to hang a water bottle my puppy likes to tip over her waterbowl so i needed a way to hang a drip bottle i found one normally used in gerbil cages that attaches with a screw and bracket and cut a tiny hole in the canvas to push the screw through and hang the bottle it works great but i wish the manufacturers would change the design to include this feature
these knives are amazing ! the storage case is even pretty handy and you can just put in a drawer and not have to worry about the knives poking around they are fun to use ! the gusto grip is great for those messy '' choppers like me no more knife slipping incidents and no more cutting myself for that same reason
the knives are fantastic it is so wonderful to work with really sharp and well balanced knives i liked them so much i went ahead and purchased more of the knives with the block but these two are the favorite knives in our kitchen my daughter and i fight over who will get to use them the big one is our favorite
the look exactly like the picture and are very comfortable to use it 's good that they are in their own case because it ensures that you wo n't have any accidents hunting around iin your utensil drawer makes chopping slicing dicing a breeze
the knives are perfect just what my husband the cook wanted for christmas they came in a timely manner and are in perfect condition
these knives are well balanced and very sharp slicing through celery onion peppers is a breeze i have arthirtis and many knives are difficult to use
i purchased this set for my husband who is a chef he raves about these knifes i am happy i made this purchase
great item i would reccomend them for anyone in the market for new cutlery
the knives were great the best i ever used they are well balanced and very sharp
beautiful canister i purchased one in each of the three sizes they look fantastic in my kitchen highly recommend
we have a couple of le creuset enameled cast iron items and they are the best we 've used for stews and braises brown on the stovetop and then put the whole dish in the oven this soup pot is a nice size the only caveat is that the flat bottom of this one is a little bit small for folks with an electric rangetop if you plan to brown in it great for large casseroles
i bought this for my daughter and she has raved about it she has cooked so many dishes in it and loves it the fact that it holds heat and can cook on low or medium easy to clean
i bought this to use as a soup pot and a dutch oven or french oven depending on what you call it it has worked out great for both purposes so far i have not been limited by the slightly bottom of the dish i would highly recommend this as a 2 in 1 piece of cookware the price is really great as well its a tough combination to beat
i have bought several le creuset items love them all this one has very small bottom which makes it good only for soup etc but again its called a soup pot pobably wouldnt buy this one again
i love this pot these items are a bit pricey but are worth it
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once for this reason one pot may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently it is recommended to use low to medium heat when cooking with cast there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide rust does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the soup pot specifically 4 quarts is not a whole lot of space when it comes to making soups consider your recipes when determining the size you need the soup pot tends to do best if at least full any less and you may overwhelm your food with the pot 's evenly dispersed heat the pot has flat bottom that broadly curves up the sides to 4 inches high making stirring your soup simple atop internal diameter of about 10 inches makes for a wide top allowing room for a whole chicken the tight fitting lid is slightly angled sealing in heat moisture and flavors use the lid to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings or holding your prepared vegetables while creating your culinary feast its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan i tend to cook large amounts so this pan is usually used for mole de pollo chili con carne chicken and dumplings tomato sauce and soups once you get beyond the basic functionality the soup pot can really open up the possibilities keep in mind this is a 4 quart pan with about a 10 inch diameter perhaps the optimal pan for families from some possibilities for this pan besides soups include rice pilaf roasted chicken braising steamed artichokes molds and assembling a baked alaska one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive compared to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced these heavy pans then go through an enameling process before being shipped if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10 pounds
absolutely gorgeous and great sized ! ! perfect for yourself or giving as a gift
works great the doser is kind of a pain sometimes but totally manageable it does a great job on the grinding and that is why i bought it bought this with the gaggia carezza and together they make great espresso
i recently reviewed the gaggia espresso maker i bought when i got this grinder and mentioned the grinder in that review my views on this grinder are simple buy it if you are the type that is because this grinder requires it you need to be right there watching tamping the beans especially if they are oily but usually even if they are not into the unit making sure the grind goes into the pockets inside the catcher and all that the entire time much like the espresso maker itself it does what it 's supposed to do and does it well but for 200 i would prefer a more automated process
i bought this grinder a year ago and we use it everyday sometimes multiple times a day it produces a consistent grind is very easy to change from an espresso setting to a coarser setting for drip coffee dosing takes practice as you have to think about how long the grind has been running to know how much you 've produced i highly recommend this product i fully expect it to last many years the only complaint i have about it is the area that holds the puck is too close to the doser
i 've had this grinder for over two decades and it has performed well when i first got my machine i wondered which setting number would be good for cappuccino or any particular grind the manual said that since coffee can vary from variety to variety or even from one roast to another it 's a matter of adjusting to each batch of beans perhaps with 34 settings people have found that to be helpful but i have found my beans to be consistent enough that adjustments are necessary for type of coffee but can be left alone for a particular type of coffee and a particular variety of beans from a source at the time i got the machine i got my beans from peet 's back when they had five stores and no other distribution channels although they are a larger chain now they are still small enough that roasting can be well controlled and they can still buy beans from a single source for a variety to meet the needs of the chain for beans from other sources where roasting is done at a variety of locations or from beans from differing sources you might need to pay more attention to adjustments a much bigger issue that affects strength and everything else is the dosing from reading the other reviews it does not seem to have changed since i got my unit the top of the unit can be filled with beans and the part over the dispensing area will fill up with a remarkably consistent grind that round area is divided into six sections like a wheel with spokes five of the sections get filled with grounds one section is empty and is above the dispenser each time the lever is pulled the wheel rotates one position clockwise and one section gets dispensed through the empty section in theory if the unit were full the amount of coffee in each section would be consistent chances are that in real life you would not want to fill the unit up for home use since the grounds would not be fresh by the time you use them if you grind just enough for a few cups then the coffee will not end up in the compartments evenly and dosing by counting pulls will not work if you lift the lower lid you can see where the coffee is and you will likely see a small mound in the back and partly filled areas toward the front if you grind smaller amounts you could redistribute things with a brush but even that way some areas would end up more compacted than others or you could merely gain the experience to know how much was dispensed compared to how much you need and pull the handle accordingly another option is to gring with the lower lid off as you watch grinds fall into the compartment you can rotate as each compartment gets filled dispensing as you go along then you can become consistent once you develop a good eye for it whether you want to consider the dispenser poorly designed is a matter of perspective if you believe that this unit was designed to grind beans for two cups of coffee then it would be a fair conclusion if you believe that this unit was designed for people who prepare cups an hour you might think that it 's just fine if you believe that it was designed for a higher level of fairly constant use you would probably not be disappointed but since this unit is most likely for home users it 's hard to claim that the dispenser is ideally suited to the task experience will let you know how high the grounds are supposed to be when you put them in the filter basket and it 's not going to take you long to learn while this unit is not fool proof chances are that you are not a fool so things will work out for me the bottom line is that once you know the correct grind setting for your beans the unit is more set it and forget it '' than what the instructions said at least with consistent beans but the dispenser is a lot less set it and forget it '' than what the literature implies personally i prefer a unit that takes the guess work out of getting the grinds to be the right consistency since it 's easy to get the amount dispensed right by eyeballing it this unit does very well in that respect i use this in conjunction with a gaggia coffee now known as gaggia classic the new gaggia coffee is a different machine and the two make a good pair learning how much coffee to dispense is a minor part compared to learning how long to hold the switch on the espresso machine or how to froth milk perfectly but ultimately it boils down to knowing how to make a proper espresso if you can tell when to stop the water based on the color of the coffee coming out then a bit more or less from the grinder will affect how full the cup gets rather than the taste of your brew you ca n't automate a perfect espresso but you can use the correct tools to allow you to make one with experience
bought this to use with my rancilio it seems to have made a huge difference i thought there was something wrong with the espresso maker as my espresso was always flat and thin tasting freshly ground beans is the way to go vast improvement over preground espresso illy 's or lavazza i would have given it 4.5 stars the only thing holdng it back is the silly doser either i 'm not using it right or its just not well designed but everything else makes this a worthwhile purchase to those coffee freaks who can afford it i used the free shipping and 25 off deal thanks threefires
its amazingly quiet considering whats happening to those poor little beans it gives me just the grade of grind i need for my espresso machine to get a perfect shot but it gets a 4 rather than 5 because there were no pads on the base i think they may have been missing or maybe they just do n't provide them even though there is a place for
i got this to accompany my gaggia 35005 carezza because had been having inconsistent results with blade grinders and store bought was n't doing it for me this thing makes a difference it 's incredible for that particular espresso machine i found that a grind setting of 9 works great the problems are the doser does n't actually neatly dose anything sometimes i have to hit it 5 times sometimes 3 puzzling you can eye it but the thing only appears to work if you grind a bunch of beans and make more than one drink first drink it takes a few pulls to get the grounds to the front for the doser also there 's no neat way to only grind what you need to use looks like some experimentation and another timer will be required another issue is it looks like you have to actually disassemble it which is not a simple task to clean it thoroughly or really even at all overall it 's quiet creates perfect grounds has a of settings although i can only see myself using two one for coffee one for espresso but the doser is garbage i might have opted for a cheaper model knowing this but my lattes are perfect now
durable beautiful wicker hampers the best and what a special price paid 30. anywhere else you will have to pay at least 80 bucks thank you amazon
i work at a deli that uses fryers all day i decided to buy this one i am throughly impressed by its design i would reccomend this fryer highly to anyone
given as a christmas gift to my daughter she was very happy with the product stating it was better with cooking times than her last fryer the well '' was deep enough to cook a family of five enough chicken at one time
i received the cookware for christmas and i have to say that this is one of the best gifts i 've ever received ! after the first weekend i had already used all the pieces at least once even twice the set includes the dutch oven with lid the one i use the most skillet the nonstick omelet pan which serves as a lid for the saucepan and the square pan plus there was a bonus 4 qt soup pot fabulous deal ! i 've noticed such a difference when cooking compared to my ltd set like the other reviewer i prefer le creuset cooking with le creuset really brings out the flavors of the food and the cleaning is sooooo much easier than say with ! i 'm not a chef by any means but the food i 've cooked has turned out superb ! i 've made coq au vin chicken marsala loster bisque chicken mango curry tarte tatin mango cobbler and the list goes on ! another big difference with le creuset and other cookware is the heat distribution on most cookware it 's easy to burn the food once the pan is heated but with le creuset it 's really hard to burn your food or mess it up in any way the way it retains the heat is amazing this set is not only functional but beautiful as well you can transport this baby from stovetop to tabletop for a lovely dinner presentation ! le creuset may be on the expensive side but believe me you wo n't be buying any other cookware after using this and it 's worth every dollar ! it is also heavier than the average cookware but you get used to the weight after a while all in all i absolutely love my le creuset set and i 'm more than happy with everything about it
my husband gave me a set for mother 's day last year and i could not love these pots and pans more ! the stews roasts and braises i have made are delicious ! i cook many curries we love indian and the enamel holds up beautifully despite the turmeric and the grill pan does a great job making crispy bacon ! i have the oval dutch oven and am not sure what to do with it besides making a roast chicken with 40 cloves of garlic but i am sure i will come up with something ! my set is red which really brightens up my beige and black kitchen
i am not sure which exact items are included in this set but are you sure that the skillet does not double as the top to the saucepan just a thought
awesome cookware cleans up really easy and looks good too
i love these knives i have spent the last year or so looking at knive sets there are some very expensive ones out on the market ! i was about purchasing any as there was always something that i just did n't like such as the design or the grip shape the set itself or even the price when i found this set it all just popped i have given them a workout and they exceed all of the expectations i had for them i love the grips the design the price and most important the function it is a perfect set for the everyday cook i highly recommend these knives
the east west knife cuts through carrots like butter ! it is so worth shelling out a little extra for the quality you recieve in this set of knives
what can you say nonslip handles sharp blades easy to clean these knives are every cooks dream plus the bottom of the birchwood block is removable so that you can clean the inside big for me
