do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick if so look no further this book is for you i understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic i guess i should n't have expected much and i certainly did n't expect a literary masterpeice but this was the first book in awhile i just felt like giving up on i did n't since it 's so short but i may just as well have it is not that the book is so grotesque '' or disturbing '' as seen described elsewhere the author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid unfortunately that applies to all aspects of this book the entire book is in rural vernacular including ignoring proper punctuation but the end result is that nothing is described in any detail it 's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened it 's almost as if he was n't really trying very hard or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person an omniscient one that can read people 's minds i suppose the idea could have worked but does n't not a terrible read just annoying and vague with so many other good books out there why waste your time
if you 're considering buying the peter smith edition '' of this book note that it is not a new edition '' in hardcover but the vintage international edition rebound in red cloth with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front it looks like it 's been rebound for libraries is the type of thing that 's usually not for sale to the general public the book is and may still be worth it to you cormac mccarthy diehards out there it is for me and ultimately i 'm just gon na keep the copy of it i bought but it 's still quite disappointing thought you deserved a warning hope it came in time mccarthy 's a great writer of course feel a little guilty about the but it 's an issue of the edition not the book
what i did n't realise when i ordered this is that it is an publication of a us kennel association it is a slim book gives a good realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like is the kennel business for me '' and what are the main issues in kennel management '' its orientation is toward large kennels dogs in the us for someone like me who is thinking about a small kennel in australia it was interesting but not really worth its pricetag
ha ha ha hah ha hah ! '' that 's stirling laughing all the way to the bank or at least i hope that 's what he is doing but sadly i suspect he more likely feels his vision of a society is a reasonable nay likely path we 'll follow should selective physical laws break down quick ! stop me ! i feel the need to wave my sword sing a gaelic song and break out my cauldron ! the genre requires we make a leap of faith and as a fan of the genre i do so willingly but having made the leap it is annoying at best to be forced through this tolkein as faith '' drivel but as i will likely read the entire series remember i love the genre i have to hope that stirling leans towards the thanks for the buck buddy '' and is himself laughing at us all but a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense ! my recommendation read the book laugh a bit maybe laugh a lot but do this with the library 's copy not one you paid for
i loved stirling 's islands in the sea of time '' trilogy and i also loved the first book in this series stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business in my mind head and shoulders above turtledove and flint in his prose and his execution but this book is one of the first books i 've ever read in which almost nothing happens at all it is not true to your reader to use an entire book which runs seven dollars for a paperback to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters this book is a major disappointment also i found myself wincing even in the first book at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters it comes across as simply ludicrous the best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from britain of the tangential british characters this is a very poor effort and though i plan to read book three even though i hated book two i think a person by reading the reviews of book two on amazon could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing
it completely sucked very long with nothing to say author was proud of his own knowledge of the sca and wiccans and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development what 's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters i now live overseas so i bought a bunch of books in the 4 for 3 '' price discount section in order to save money this is the first one i read of the received books if they 're all this bad i 'll be avoiding that discount database in the future
i found that everytime i started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory for instance the family that was running from the baron and his men it started out fine and then of course the rest of the wiccan army shows up and it ends some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away no one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended i was like what just happened ! '' it misses the small points that make a world believable most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them there was no humanity in the scene which i thought it was going to show just a chance for the wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs very bad stuff there in my opinion i like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense also leaving out important elements of the story such as when the wiccan witch is talking about who would stand against the bad guy in portland she completely left out mt angel and the warrior monks as an ally granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the monks they sound interesting but are ignored i guess being christians is not worth writing about why are they ignored their premise is as i said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages there seem to be no faults in the utopian good guys '' world there are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off mike bearkillers skills at being a leader to the english chap of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again the characters are just too simple even the heroes although i like mike his wife and the english trio they are interesting hordle is one of my favorites but i am left with an empty character in the end of course the english trio and cpt nobbes went from the coast of africa to portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly as i said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around south america or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story i do n't know it just beamed them to portland without an answer to just simple questions did they get the prince to safety i guess i am left to make up my own story the mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing i can not say much about them because i just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me we can not find out what happened to the prince of wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots i have nothing against wicca i know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing i would want to know that might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me and i am not a christian either really more agnostic i guess i know why now i think the old roman gods would be more fitting mars and jupiter gods of war and the blade and bow and stuff such as that just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest i felt i was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional clans '' either they were either lord of the rings heroes or druids i do not know really know which i could not read the nonsense but it is his story and i am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too of course there are some huge gaps missing what happened to the us army marine corp us navy for 60 years the us military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force they just went poof the dark lord in portland would have been far better as some egotistical general carving out his own slice of the pie tacoma washington is home to one of the largest us army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation not to mention the numerous naval bases throughout the area at least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got vxed or something because to be honest i would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. but that is just me not my story that is just one huge gap i kept asking about but never found an answer i love the premise of the story i just think it was badly presented no offense to anyone that loves it
while i enjoyed most of dies the fire by the end i was very annoyed with the juniper character and found myself skipping over the boring details of her wiccan prayers and outlook i had hopes for the protectors war and unfortunately it 's worse than it 's predecessor mckenzie and her group get far too much play and come across as self righteous religious fanatics the reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle i found myself skipping large chunks of this book and the switching from linear narrative to flashback in did n't help matters any there is too much exposition and not enough action all in all a boring disapointment the third book in the series is out in hardcover but i wo n't even be checking it out of the library
i use the notebook '' and a walk to remember '' as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer '' i was more satisfied with the rescue '' taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl
i have read several of nicholas sparks ' books but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from sparks like the notebook '' or the wedding '' if you want a good romantic read
i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor 's was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find nothing oh what a waste it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it had n't been for my hrr home reading report i would n't have finished reading this at all i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah
i'am unable to get this message to anyone this is the second book i orderd and both books are bad this one starting on disc 4 all is bad i sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me i had the same problem on vanishing point the cd left will not play on my player i will not order another book from you once i can see this happen but twice is unacceptable
i read bruner 's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education however journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to bruner 's overly dense prose he highlights the idea of culture defining curriculum through its langauge customs history and society status but he fails to offer examples accessible to the classroom teacher i would recognize this book as a added addition to to any early childhood professional 's library but please prepare yourself for many
this is by far the worst book i have ever been forced to read one star is too much the title of this book the culture of education '' leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education he toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does but would n't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way this book is entirely unreadable for example here is a sentence from page 106 many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection '' what exactly does this mean i 'll tell you what i think this book is i think that bruner is trying to impress people while trying to make them feel stupid if he has something to say he should just say it ! he buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as immutable '' pontogenetically '' and hermeneutic '' if you are buying this book on amazon i suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell
i did n't like this book truth be told i still have n't finished it and i bought it over six months ago the characters are boring the situation while ripe with potential drags and the recipes do n't even sound good i am supremely disappointed as i usually love what nora ephron does bummer
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement '' chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent he had a crappy upbringing that does not make for a good book
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug and written by a person with little or no empathy especially for the people he castigates for example his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the '' shrink '' bashers of the world this play for effect '' tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me
this book was horrible if it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have i am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend i read half of it suffering from a headache the entire time and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire one less copy in the world do n't waste your money i wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes this book wasted my life
if you like strange stories you will love running with scissors '' because it is just plain weird after reading this book you will have a feeling that you just returned from the twilight zone marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book the book was anything but funny i read about half up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 old was just sick i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick mentally ill characters i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
i am disappointed with the quality of the images they are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all i have returned this book which is something i do once every 1000 books i order and it is the first art book i have ever returned in my life
the book the only investment guide you 'll ever need '' is a gross misnomer at best the book should be entitled a good personal finance guide '' if a person bought the book as i did for expert stock market investment guidance may likely be highly disappointed the book contains very good personal finance guidance that 's all way overstated with the title !
this being the first book i read by danielle steel i expected more than what i got since i love the moive verisons of her book the start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and i like alittle unpredicatable stuff
there 's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject but winchester abuses the privilege there 's no digression too minute no reference too arcane no place where one word ca n't be replaced with 100. when he does finally get to a set of pertinent points the writing is excellent that 's what kept me from giving it a worse review too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of mixed nuts if you 're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets the book is worth your time otherwise pass on it
how can a author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding
the amazing part of this tragedy is that shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans directly or indirectly this book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior while this book has become a major read for those who are into victimhood '' the sad truth is that shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise good night killer
normally i like nora roberts but this book was a very tough read callie the main character was not likeable whatsoever she was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth she did not come across as strong or just nasty it was not entertaining just tiresome i started skimming towards the end because i just wanted to get through it the end was did n't really settle the issue of two sets of parents the last few pages were practically identical to three fates which incidentally was a great read
i just completed this book yesterday and i must confess if it was any longer i might not have while it was mildly entertaining it contains little that is new or particularly informative the book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in churchill 's life many of the comparisons seem strained in fact comparing churchill 's almost stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition seems inappropriate and a little silly it 's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business or otherwise these kernals are relatively simple and it seems to me obvious it begs the question why exactly do we need a book such as this the people most apt to the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for churchill if so those people will likely have read books which are more informative historically significant insightful and generally worthwhile if this is your first introduction to churchill do not let it be your last overall i think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time
as a longtime fan of churchill and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading well it was but only from the 'fan ' position the author sets out with good intentions and early in the book he relates churchill ways back into the context of today 's executive 's environment but by the middle and then thereafter he 's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no real relevance to application to today 's leadership 'student ' at times mr hayward really is squeezing the pips to show winston as a model to follow i 've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary has n't picked up on the idea if you want to understand churchill it 's a good read if it 's leadership you want you 'll have to browse further
i 'm going to say something that might sound odd this is not a leadership book it deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of churchill 's style but strangely not his executive success in the face of adversity '' and hayward 's assertion that churchill 's style is like that of an executive seems a little hayward spends a lot of time defending against churchill 's critics that churchill was disorganized and a bad judge of character in all likelihood he is forcing churchill into a category that he does not belong indeed churchill may have been disorganized but he was a darn good prime minister my opinion is that churchill deserves more than this in place of this book i would recommend lincoln on leadership
as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i 'm an honor roll student with straight a 's in english i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death it did me pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill the only good part of this book was herbert he was the only one i liked my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it yes this book has given dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could a nutshell its definately a college read
this book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great so i hate it ! this book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time but i hate it because the title is misleading what the dickens does the author think he 's doing giving this book a title like that !
when i received this book i was really eager to read it the whole storyline appealed to me and i was convinced based on the first few chapters that i would enjoy it i 'm not sure when i changed my mind maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political china when i just wanted to know more about the main characters sometimes i felt as if the author could n't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story while her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side i found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts also the ending which i wo n't give away sort of left me feeling cheated i suppose i could 've overlooked all of those things except for one thing the fact is the main character just is n't very interesting or likeable to me that 's a
i have mixed feelings about this novel about an american teacher named hope and paul her chinese student on one hand it was often very interesting as liu gives a lot of historical detail about san francisco and china on the other hand the characters were rather shallow i did n't find hope who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day particularly appealing was far more interesting and was portrayed with some complexity and depth the romance between hope and rang false for me honey i first fell in love with you when i realized it was required for the plot to progress ! '' i still ca n't see what attracted them to each other also did anyone else notice that any slight against hope is recorded with meticulous detail the rampant racism against chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned but liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel a hearty blonde swede a drunk surly irishwoman and hope 's disagreeable to name a few also she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize all the britons in the book are '' bigots and all the christians are consistently hypocritical or stupid or both in addition much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they 're just the opposite and to top it all off the ending was forced this novel could have been so much better as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents she obviously had some fascinating material to work with and one more quibble one of hope and 's daughters is named jennifer pearl in 1908 the name jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world cornwall uk
i used to admire this woman she was smart she inspired me when i was young it is a shame however to see her intellectual decline in her last years was this the effect cancer had on her brain first i ca n't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called the force of reason '' she appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality second she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts for instance she quietly forgot the role of christianity in the conquest of the americas and the slaughter of the indian races or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the european powers and what about the survival of catholicism in spain in spite of eight centuries of muslim domination yes there were churches and synagogues in muslim spain this manifesto does n't look very different from those fascists wrote about jews in europe in the poor woman
i listened to a cd from the library then bought the book simply to get the use id code required to take the test for about 20 bucks you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths i 'm a bit disappointed at the lack of direction deliberative ideation learner analytical intellection with only a small paragraph describing each strength if you are serious i would suggest spending serious money for example about 4 years ago i paid 2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of iq tests to my son 6 taking 6 or 7 hours of tests for 2500 i received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son if you are looking for true insight as to career change i would think that you would be better off investing some real money twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey but provides little in the way of a road map if it happens to help you great to me the book is more an appetizer than a full meal the website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about 2000 if you have that kind of coin i would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood so that you get advice tailored specifically to you
this is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published the fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of and the development of societies is indeed sad mcelvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering his imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy i guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things ' and put enough of a feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership that 's what happened here do n't waste your time a disturbing aspect to this is that he 's teaching the next generation of leaders
this is not one of the better books i have read on history that predates mankind before reading the book i knew that women were the first farmers the author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women i do not buy the argument

i read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that i was not in the right space to appreciate this book when i read it this was the most boring piece of literature ever written i know it was a period of age story but pages upon pages of people picking cotton talking about cotton and talking about picking cotton zzzzzz took me forever to finish because i kept passing out and having nightmares yep cotton
i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did

this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention keep you enthralled and refuse to let you stop reading i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is but it 's because how good everything is until the very end that 's right the incredible of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel this is deus ex machina '' in its finest form this is unexcusable in my opinion i just do n't get it i just do n't understand how one can seemingly work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages i gave it two stars as opposed to one for fooling everyone into reading through this book this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
it 's probably been 15 years since i read it and every person in the years since with whom i have discussed this book has said the same thing it was literally a book that kept me up until 3 and that is how it ends i 'm hoping crichton had a publishing deadline or something
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be
this 1987 thriller focuses on norman johnson a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget once the team is taken to the navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances that the navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology labels and directions are even written in english leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is the suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile this novel is quite predictable just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby that the undersea environment will become threatening there will be many deaths there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on while there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment crichton is capable of so much more if you are a fan read it but be forewarned if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this
the author could have done much more with her subject many anecdotes in the book suggest sandy weill is a complex character for example weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal yet ridiculously lavish executive at one point he wo n't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet unfortunately she never addresses the question how can weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly other similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest weill is a very complex individual but the author never treats him as such in the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter 's of weill 's life and career to sew the articles together into a coherent story the author suggests that weill 's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the waspy wall street powerbrokers who wo n't let a jew join their club perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven weill for the past 40 years but it raises interesting questions that the author does n't address i 'm a jew in finance and jews have been very on wall street for some time now weill is presented as having been driven to create citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the waspy wall street club but by this point we 're into the nineties and any exclusive waspy club had long since been abolished so all of a sudden weill comes off as pathologically insecure which is intriguing but the author does n't elaborate this is a good book if you want a run down of sandy weill 's career no other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place but all that information confirms that weill himself is a very complex man to do her complex subject justice the author would have had to do much more with this book
i do n't so much mind the money i wasted on this book it 's the time that bothers me bill rancic you 're fired
i really do congratulate bill rancic for being hired by one of the richest man in the world but being hired does not mean that bill rancic just became the next bill gates or warren buffet great to know that you take yourself very very highly your going to fit fine in the trump organization but seriously dont over do yourself i 'd rather retake my intro to business administration ' class in my college than to buy this book
bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know the show was much better you should buy that kwame is much smater and deserved the job i can tell that this book is another promotional tool do n't waste even a cent on this book
based on a storyline from the 1800 's this book in this day and age is verging on child pornography child neglect and promiscuous language i can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language however the heroine of this book is old at the beginning of the book is treated as a child throughout the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or some of the language used is so 1940 's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of years some very good escapist scenes however it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the century movie that is planned when there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from why did movie makers choose this one
i agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious wallace is obviously highly intelligent and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that it all starts off well enough the characters are quirky and interesting at first and wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what 's going to happen but nothing ever really happens and at some point i just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives ultimately this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect and while that exercise may have been rewarding for wallace it was n't so terribly rewarding for the reader
there might be a good idea for a joke but it just does not come out funny that 's about all i can say about this amazingly overrated book seems to have all the ingredients to be good great ohio desert funny the names of the people funny and so on came out to be just boring pretentious dull dialogue pretentious dull characters i was reading it in a morbid disbelief that lasted for more than half of the book it is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once i passed the halfbook mark i usually want to know what happened '' it kept me going here for some more pages and then i decided nothing of it really happened does not matter waste of time none of the characters surroundings or events were in any way interesting
it 's not too difficult to understand how behold a pale horse '' has become the best selling underground book of all time '' according to a blurb on one website after all people want to and do believe in outlandish things the problem with the late bill cooper 's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy powerful men cooper believed this cooper was a nut therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut too rightly or wrongly this is what people believe if you 're looking for a serious treatment of this subject albeit from the pov of someone who thought it was a good thing take a gander at carroll quigley 's monumental tragedy and hope '' to all the if you ca n't handle the truth do n't read this book ! '' reviewers who know little to nothing about bill cooper i invite you to do a google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth the real truth milton william cooper was a certifiable headcase numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a violent man who was incredibly easy to fool cooper 's contention that john kennedy was killed by william greer the driver of his limo in dallas is of course but he also believed and told audiences at his lectures that the aliens on the fox television show alien nation '' were real aliens he was n't kidding cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information then take it and repeat it ! as gospel fellow fringe '' writers and researchers like bob lazar shunned cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him there was of course no need for anyone else to discredit him he took care of that himself nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book mostly documents and articles from other sources really with a comment here and there by cooper himself is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance anyhow i 'll go on record as saying that i believe the circumstances of cooper 's death were suspicious i feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to pale horse '' this was a human being with real feelings but he was very very disturbed there are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally so many that behold a pale horse '' should never become any conspiracy theorist 's bible
type cooper 's name into google and learn about what a nut job he really was he allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun a court issued an arrest warrant when two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them they returned fire killing him
having never read a book by danielle steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels i was looking forward to reading answered prayers since i usually always find the books more deep and interesting sadly i could n't have been more disappointed the first thing that bothered me about this novel was the amount of repetition it has i was just through the first few pages of the first chapter and i was already being told things usually insignificant which i had just read a few lines before secondly the moment brad is introduced into the plot i could foresee with certainty how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end so as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading i reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable the book could n't possibly be danielle steel 's number one bestseller '' as the cover proclaims seems like i have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a bestseller '' the major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other faith is sweet and caring has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own leaving her feeling lonely and sad her husband is cold unreligious and gives her no attention brad is sweet and caring has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own leaving him feeling lonely and sad his wife is cold unreligious and gives him no attention even faith 's deep dark secret '' is too unoriginal and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book leaving no room for curiosity and suspense halfway through the book i was so bored that i considered giving up reading it altogether however i kept pushing on praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere to at least make reading answered prayers worthwhile unlike faith however my prayers remained unanswered it 's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a danielle steel novel again
normally i do n't take the time to write a review but this book just bugged me when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem the plot was good but moved slowly i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much i am glad that this book was in a box of books that i paid 15 for at a used book store i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it
read the first few chapters and the last few pages as usual the remaining 300 pages were just repetition danielle steele should come up with a new formula '' as mentioned in previous reviews or tuck her pen away once and for all
this has to be one of the worst written books i ever read i ca n't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing so far danielle steel has found a way in the first third of this book i just ca n't read the rest of it generally if a book is n't very good i can suffer through this one has gotten on my last nerve i had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable but i do n't think i will be reading anymore of her books it 's an insult to nora roberts and sandra brown for her to be ranked with them
i 'm not sure who 's writing these reviews but i read repitition after repitition after repitition with a lot of confusing fluff asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues what 's fierce '' about that the writing style and content just did n't flow was n't real i mean in one section she actually uses the term bucko '' as in let me tell you something bucko '' what are we in happy days '' could n't take the book seriously after that very bad
this could have been one of the most important books of the year scott ritter provides important but tangential information related to israel 's influence over foreign policy the history of the iaea in iran and the theory of regime change as the real reason for concern '' over iran 's nuclear weapons infrastructure unfortunately ritter misses on two counts first he offers little direct insight into the bush administration 's process and second someone forgot to edit the book we are talking about gross grammatical errors periods in the middle of a sentence and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period it is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed at first i thought my eyes were tired at least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and npr it does provide some real insights into the workings of the iaea israeli intelligence and exiled who often lead policy astray ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise weapons inspections this topic requires far more than that
do you look like this person on the cover if not you may want to rethink this book i got it as a gift but plan on regifting '' it soon it makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people interesting asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young indian boys for a different view take a look at the yoga of heart '' by mark whitwell
alterman tries to deny the obvious bias of the media through fallacious arguments for one he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities in actuality at one time minorities were in fact seldom shown on tv and then almost always in negative stereotyped roles black maids asian coolies but those times have changed not so with the liberal bias in fact i sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child long before i knew what a liberal even was i saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in vietnam while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the communists at that time i wondered why now i know alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias in actuality since most journalists are liberals no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist liberals simply do what comes naturally to them as it stands when a new set of democratic phraseology arises it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media this proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the democratic party every election cycle it is the same every charge against a republican is publicized no matter how trivial democrats are their conduct is so egregious that it can not possibly be ignored whenever jesse jackson opens his mouth especially against republicans he gets profuse uncritical coverage no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are conservative blacks get almost no coverage alterman tells us that when it bleeds it leads '' nice try but this does not absolve the media of its bias there is a double standard against violence violence against homosexuals is reported while violence by homosexuals is not right wing violence abortion clinic bombings is demonized while left wing violence is not the persecution of christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is one can go on and on
to hinkle goldfarb 's '' review i would like to add several observations alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels and not to any liberal bias he leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable could it be that the interviewers at fox for example were asking questions that network reporters were not i also picked up on alterman 's assertion that the msm 's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal william buckley 's firing line '' was considered conservative but virtually 50 of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views especially in the formal debates fox 's special report with brit hume has maura liason a reasonable liberal and the ridiculously insufferable juan williams both of pbs but is also considered by alterman to be a conservative program i was completely floored by his statement that cokie roberts of abc is a conservative ! bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude liberals are moderate conservatives are extreme rightists
if alterman just watched a nightly news cast of cnn which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like mcdonalds fast food however those who know better avoid it because it can be damaging to one 's mental health but then again alterman just wrote this book for the money even if he makes a fool of himself doing it
other reviewers have pointed out the errors eric alterman makes in this book like saying that the was under the kyoto protocol that was particularly annoying he needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins
while i enjoyed reading the first half of this book the second was pure agony i actually started to skim through most of the pages until i reached the end it is dense with detail almost too dense for instance finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire his descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages but by page 10 of the fire i was completely and totally bored now i 'm not saying fiction should always be a quick easy read '' quite the contrary i found finney 's writing to be refreshing but c'mon folks this book should have been pages shorter strictly for romance lovers
kim shows how investing for women can be very real and her approach is down to earth she triggers thoughts with stories and examples shows the reader that no matter where you are at in life you can do this
do n't waste your time with rich woman just read rich dad poor dad the book rich woman is nothing but a advertisement for their books and seminars f
90 of this book is about kim and her husband and how they got to where they are there is very little information on how to actually go about investing she 's a good cheerleader not so good on passing along good advice
i have had the isbn 0449214923 version of this book for a number of years and as it has travelled many miles it 's got rather tatty so i purchased this edition within the first hour of reading the spine split into two also it is a shabby printing as the subheadings in bold have the centers of the characters filled in i recommend the book but not this
i read this as a relatively young woman and lord did it make an impression on me it features many passages endorsing beastiality something i find morally reprehensible if you agree then bingo ! you now know to steer clear of this garbarge i 'm not an advocate of but i would n't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire
again i bought this book because of the outstanding reviews and am sadly disappointed this is junk not one of the three stories is entertaining the only positive i can say is that it has a similar feel to gene wolfe but that is like saying an ant is similar to a man because it has legs so just forget it this blows
one could right an honest history i suppose by sticking to the facts paul johnson 's propaganda is simply lying as just one instance of this paul johnson assures the reader that president johnson was reluctant to escalate the vietnam war he further assures us there is no evidence as was later alleged that the incident was contrived to get america deeper into the war '' and further but congress by an overwhelming majority passed the tonkin gulf resolution ' authoring the president to take vigorous measure to protect us forces '' one would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the pentagon papers so explicitly state that the official account of the tonkin gulf attack was a deliberate deception in the october harper 's article the next war '' daniel ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers memos estimates and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the johnson administration for a wider war expected to commence soon after the election '' though far more inclined to trust ellsberg than johnson either paul or lyndon i admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth but i have not heard that the pentagon papers were not genuine when johnson is not simply lying he uses facts to support a viewpoint which he himself must know to not be true support for intensifying the war was always greatest among the under '' at least prior to november 1968 by which time the decision to get out had already been taken '' by whom considering that the young had been nursed on heroic world war ii movies trained in blind patriotism '' and educated in such a manner as to preclude questioning governmental authority what else was to be expected once we woke up to what had been done to us we the american people most definitely lost our stomach for the war with historians '' like paul johnson it is not surprising that another generation has been duped peter payne author of captain california battles the beelzebubian beasts of the bible
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede '' without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times
do dogs understand language do they have their own syntax and grammar stanley coren thinks so or maybe as with many of his other books he 's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people 's interest and sell more copies the words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant since i train dogs in manhattan i often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs when the door closes i 'll say what do we do on an elevator '' and they 'll all sit this often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like look ! they understand every word you say ! '' not really i trained the dogs to do this by first saying what do we do on an elevator sit '' once that pattern was established the dogs were able to make the leap from what do we do on an elevator '' to sit '' quite easily in fact i could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words gobbledygook ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all so it is n't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to it 's my intent my body language my tone of voice all carrying emotional information and a previously established pattern of behavior stanley coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf yet still obeys him why because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior not because the dog understands '' his words coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the understand sign language but looked at objectively it 's far more likely that the dog 's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior not a linguistic or cognitive process coren would still disagree he claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together which he takes to mean that there 's a kind of syntax or grammar at work i 'm sorry stan but real language does n't operate on such a simplistic level and while it may seem brave and controversial of coren who has a degree in psychology not linguisics or animal behavior to disagree with noam chomsky about the nature of language at this stage in the development of linguistic science that 's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with sir isaac newton about gravity look it 's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips barks growls etc are sometimes used together and others are n't which is n't always true by the way it depends on the dog is that each vocalization comes from an emotional not a cognitive state in other words certain emotions like fear and aggression may be felt by the animal simultaneously while others calmness and fear ca n't be it 's not grammar or syntax it 's emotion pure and simple even if coren had n't thought this through from an emotional point of view if he 'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he 'd know that a dog 's brain has no broca 's area which makes linguistic ability totally impossible but as with other books he 's written his syndrome was notorious for being based on false data coren does n't seem to care much about the truth still i have to admit that it 's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we 're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues or to others through conversations letters etc as a result we 're almost forced by the way our brains work to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog 's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists i trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever i ask him a certain question and i have to admit i like the way it feels when i say to him do you love me '' and he wags his tail comes over puts his paws on my chest and licks my nose does he understand the meaning of that sentence when i say it to him of course not but i know he understands the emotion it 's a shame that coren does n't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog a relationship that should be based on real and quite often wonderful emotions not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language if i could i 'd give this book no stars at all
i 'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work however is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this it 's akin to the random scribblings of a old or a canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes '' and brilliant artistry '' of the play
considering the size of the book i was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given they are mostly one word meanings if there is a meaning at all mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for it was n't helpful for me i found the babyname wizard '' book a lot more informative and helpful
this book bears an amazing similarity to best baby names by diane stafford but hers is better because it 's the original shame on you
i can not bring myself to cook anything from these books the recipes include too much fat recipes that include large amounts of butter cream cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty i 'll bet they taste wonderful however creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible also i resent having to use paula 's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them i have watched the tv cooking programs and enjoyed them the food she cooks has always looked delicious though rich paula 's accent is lovely to listen to and her presentation is beautiful photos of the finished dishes would have been extremely welcomed also the quality of book paper was poor i really should simply return the books and might do that only 1 star from me if that disappointed
the pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning i 've never read a danielle steel before and i wo n't be speeding to the nearest barnes noble to get another one other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition i picked up on that before reading the reviews there have also been suggestions that steel needs an editor for gawd 's sake she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world ! they must have hundreds of editors but perhaps just perhaps they are intimidated by the prolific steel then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility nobody could be as eccentric as stanley and run a powerful and megarich conglomerate there 's no way a house as large as the house in the center of san francisco no less could ever be bought and restored for the ending is as predictable as the setting 's weather steel has made a lot of money from her readers they deserve better than this
danielle steel used to be one of my favorite authors however wanderlust was the last book of hers that i really liked i bought the house hoping maybe she had found her style '' again but alas it was not to be i do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining within one paragraph telling '' not showing '' the story and repeating the same things over and over and over until i just want to scream ! it seems that perhaps because she is such a big name her work is not copyread anymore i think it might be time for her to put away her pen or get back to the basics of good writing i will not be buying another of her books anytime soon i chose to rate this book with one star because no stars was n't a choice
it 's summer and my reading matter always lightens up significantly ! i spotted this book at the library and figured why not ! i know i said never again for danielle steel but the plot interested me how bad could it be right well there 's good news and bad news the good news is that the plot is different for ds and held my interest enough so that unlike impossible i actually finished it in one day the bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing the repetition is maddening when reading becomes a chore and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything it 's time to start some serious editing here are some suggested areas of improvement shorten up the paragraphs they should not exceed a page ! try spending a little more time developing the characters i could n't see '' sarah when i read i want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages i never had a clear vision of the main character pay attention to style every time she spelled out i wanted to pull my hair out small thing but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence as i 've written before ds needs a good editor this book could have been one of her best to date
after chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her romance she finally buys the house aha i thought the story begins but alas not much happens then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house and i think ok here 's the story but not to be then there is the architect that enters a good love story no danielle steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them the story of the grandmother 's life in the house would have been tremendous i think maybe she had a visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly because she did not put any thought into this one where was the editor on this one it was a bummer virgini
do n't waste your time or money on this book it was about as interesting as watching paint dry ! maybe danielle steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out
i wasted time reading this book that i will never get back it was repetitive predictable and drawn out i only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending but it turned out the way i thought it would buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly and for predicting how the story goes but i would not waste the time if i were you
i read a lot a lot and rarely have i read a book that i really really did n't like but this is one of them there is such a lack of dialogue and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over i swear if i would have had to read the words four years '' one more time referring to the main character 's failed relationship i would have hurt somebody there was so much that could have been done with this book but by the time she actually gets the house you 've been bored stiff for four years and do n't much care it seems to be that it was poorly edited and there is a lot of awkward grammar i was really disappointed
well first off i did not like the book nor the movie both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art on the other hand i take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here as some sound very in their reviews we being good americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not we do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the american experience for that if you do not understand this tnen be quiet about things you do not understand
clear and present danger is ok at points but the rest of the novel is boring with the cia work the action between the commandos do n't feel realistic the story drags on on for hundreds of pages the boring details of how big a ship is that is boring ! if you want to read a real and exciting novel read bob mayer 's eyes of the hammer bib mayer is a former special forces officer the action is there and is very exciting unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action
as far as crime dramas go this is firmly mediocre the story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically but the author 's writing style is sometimes a distraction why do the suspects always ask for slice soda to drink and they repeatedly make a point of asking for slice do they even make it anymore i thought it was replaced by sierra mist and another distracting detail is the author 's way of giving so many people nicknames you do n't need to tell me that a guy 's name is ed smiley '' jones if you never mention smiley '' again or there 's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname that said i liked the use of dc as the backdrop and if i was going on a plane ride i would probably pick up another book by pelecanos but i would n't let anyone see what i was reading and then i 'd leave it in the seatback when i deplaned
i love to read and listen to books on cd but i have tried to listen to this a couple of times and i am disgusted the language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that i ca n't get past the second disc very disappointed

schaeffer adds yet another book to the this is why christians have it right '' category of literature though christians nor schaeffer by no means have a monopoly on such an approach i found it to be especially unsettling in it 's lack of insight into modernism picasso we are told failed his artistic goal to paint the unpaintable the sublime was never realized first of all to really understand 'modern ' painting we would certainly want to ponder the birth of photography and its influence on illustrative painting illustrative painters were experiencing an identity crisis brought on by the industrial revolution much like the rest of the entire world except good old schaeffer artists turned to the 'sublime ' because they needed to discover what painting could do that photography could never do show the unshowable and so picasso 's paintings become less 'realistic ' they imply movement they imply other ways of seeing than the symbolic boxes the modern and postmodern worlds are born into again except schaeffer to say picasso failed suggests no appreciation for any of this nor does it seem schaeffer took the time to really analyze a cubist painting how is it different from what came before why what does it show that a photograph could not what does it 'imply ' ! etc the analysis of picasso suggests not an inkling of thought as to why cubism came about for cubists and modernists in general except for how it makes no sense to a christian thus the this is why christians have it right '' feel of the critique i can not imagine anyone who has appreciated a modern painting or read anything about modern artists swallowing this rather it is for people who find modernism pointless to be able to say oh they 're lost that 's why it makes no sense '' lastly paul himself claimed that we see through a glass darkly '' the jews of the torah read old testament could not even utter the name of god because of that being 's supreme mystery composers from palestrina to bach attempted to 'imply ' something above and beyond their actual art that is what good art does schaeffer to say someone failed because they never actually got to the sublime they never actually clearly illustrated it never fully understood it is to indict paul himself paul admitted his limitations it is a shame schaeffer did not turn some of that powerful insight in on himself why do you criticize the speck of dust in your brothers eye when you have a log in your own
this book should have been an short magazine article the authors basically dissect one concept over and over and over change is disruptive there is very little useful information in this book it points out all of the obvious and problems that come with change productivity suffers commitment is lost but gives no insight in how to fix the problems unless you count these golden keep your eye on the ball '' and provide direction '' the one chapter that i hoped would shed some light on tactics integration project management '' was pure fluff it offered such pearls of wisdom as it is helpful to look at the integration process as a logical sequence of steps designed to help bring the two organizations together '' not only is this a duh '' statement but it shows up in chapter 8 ! i would expect to read something like that in the introduction and chapters 5 and 6 state that you should evaluate key talent in the aquired firm but no where in these chapters does it tell you how to do it ! i guess you have call up pritchett associates and fork over big for the details my only guess is that the authors kept the book generic on purpose so that companies would call and ask about their consulting services my advice save your money for a real book and just call up pritchett associates for their marketing literature
i would give this book a zero if it were possible anyone that wants to follow this book is more than likely screwing up their child i would consider doctor '' ezzo 's philosophy a form of child abuse this thing is the most awful upsetting piece of parenting literature i 've ever read ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i do n't understand why would parents not want to go to your baby at night when he is crying what is wrong with loving your baby cuddles and attending to their needs oh yeah i forgot parenting seems to given way to the form of training your baby like a puppy fitting convieniently '' into your lives with alot of distance no empathy no trust little to no communication little emotional bonding and in the future this results in children who have attachment problems in later life trouble regarding relationships and practically seem to be teaching them to be independent and self sufficient from the time they are brought home from the hospital how heartbreaking sorry i do n't beleive in the form of abuse as this book is about and i wish more parents felt the same as i do
first off my wife and i tried babywise several years ago because we were sleep deprived beyond all belief please do n't make the same mistake your baby will start sleeping better i swear other parents we know have tried babywise and the results of ranged from abandoning the philosophy to seriously altering their children 's psyche babywise may work '' for many families in the sense that you get your newborn to sleep through the night but it is a very rigid and inflexible parenting style and over the long run i have seen it result in resentful children in the short term it is very hard on both baby and parent because the baby will be miserable and you will feel guilty before buying into this philosophy remember that has been subject to widespread criticism and while it work in the sense of getting your baby to sleep it is in this reviewer 's opinion very dangerous over the long haul and shortsighted on the part of tired parents at the very least please ask your pediatrician for their honest assessment of this book before trying it if you are looking for a far better and far more credible book on parenting try either doctor spock 's baby child care or the american academy of pediatrics caring for your baby young chil
if you 're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun fish ! is the one i 'd recommend in fun works the author presents eleven principles that are supposed to help us understand the importance of the fusion '' with eleven principles this book is all over the place and somehow misses the mark i fervently believe that work should be fun but i did n't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way
nora roberts 's books are my escape and usually a blissful one i love the magic character development strong women overcoming obstacles and romance found in her novels morrigan 's cross disappointed me vampires are a little over the edge for me but what made me close the book was the vampire with the protaganist i spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable and reading this put me in a bad mood king was a comic relief but he got killed that was when i did something i 've never done with a book closed it put it in the closet and later sold it i 'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy instead i took out the three sisters ' trilogy and enjoyed myself
just not my cup of tea well written but as i said not my cup of will not purchase the others in the series
my brother bought this cookbook for me years ago for christmas and i have yet to crack it open you can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free but why would you after seeing some of her more recent episodes i am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside her recipes scare me and i would n't feed half of what she makes to my dog do n't waste the money if you think you wan na try her recipes print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire
if you are looking for love romance witty banter and everything else that has made suzanne brockmann a hit n't expect it from this book ! ! the romance is undeveloped sparse and stale the suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt a great read if you 're looking for nightmares
i used to love sb novels but the last few have been so very disappointing and into the storm '' is by far the worst there is no character development so we do n't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other basically they 've known each other at best casually through work they sleep together having the most amazing sex ever ! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other hmmm that may work at 17 but the characters are in their late and early they have very responsible professional careers and by now should know that love is based on far more than casual sex the situations sb keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre all of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and i began skimming pages hoping that something somewhere would grab my attention no such luck i used to love reading sb novels i could n't wait for new books to be published and i 'd stay up late into the night reading no more in fact i think i 'm done with brockmann granted i never read sb for the suspense i loved the character development the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story if i want suspense which appears to be where sb would rather go these days i 'd much rather spend my time and money reading tess gerritsen or karin slaughter they do suspense so much better
i have previously enjoyed all of suzanne brockmann 's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction i have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances i really hate it what a yawner and i would n't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated
ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career he is an grad while i found some of his insights to be helpful he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings while he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his roots ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club caddying at a country club is not a degrading job for a kid working as a cashier at cvs is how does the cvs kid network his way out in one point in the book ferrazzi creates a lot of build up about an event he attended and how much anxiety he felt the big denouement was that he had a connection through yale this is not compelling i was expecting him to have had to actually overcome something there are some good insights in the book but few that i had n't heard before i 'm not sure that this book has shed any light on anything aside from the advantages of belonging to networks
bought it because the author had compiled the book on buffett 's annual reports got really bored with this book however it is written too acadamic style and mostly a reiteration of you will be much happy if you read intelligent investor buffets essay book this book is just an attempt to make money by invoking the names of investment masters in its title i got my lesson only buy books written by the investment gurus who write it from their experience
i believe that this book might be interesting for someone who is unfamiliar with value investing but i must warn the more experienced reader that not much of new ideas are to found in this book what surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to convincing people that marekts are inefficient but what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place right anyone interested in this book can skip the first half the second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing my advice avoid this book and buy instead 'the essays of warren buffet ' of the same author the latter is really a for anyone serious about investing
this book is really disappointing because it has very little to do with the title of the book it is a total waste of money after reading this book you will hardly thing like graham and invest like buffett no chance ! read the first two books from hagstrom and buffetts letters to the shareholders dont by this one terrible
i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several run on sentences with no punctuation i was determined to try though once i got used to the almost editing i was able to enjoy the story it is a challenge but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life i 'm not sure the effort was worth it though note to writers employ editors so that your story is n't lost due to hard to read prose ! it added nothing to the book to create a new style '' and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead
frustrated authors take note you can be published and you do n't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation sentence clarity story structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses '' had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher who was either drunk or high or both who thought what the hell let 's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i 'm sure people will buy it after all americans do n't care about grammar anyway '' i 'm not going to dive into the plot of the you can read it above this book falls short of one of the best in literature how they compare this guy to faulkner is beyond me the comparrison is an insult to faulkner and people who read books in general most fifth graders can write better more enthralling naratives
i guess i 'd better confess right away i did n't finish this book i only made it a third of the way before i was too disgusted to finish it i 'm sure there are many useful things i could learn if i could choke it all down but it was very difficult i do n't think it helped that i just finished the case against by al norman i think it 's great that was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really did n't have access to a department store or discount retailer but i ca n't get over the desruction of american businesses american jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for american workers not to mention all the foreign workers who produce goods that have become standard operating procedure lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business and while i agree that soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful i think the damage is costly
i have always wondered about professor chomsky 's writings he has always been described as and by the right i finally got an opportunity to read his book hegemony or survival i was surprised at how readable it was i expected it to be overly verbose i was also surprised that i actually agreed with some of what he had to say particularly about iraq he certainly is correct that the us led invasion of iraq was a fantastic opportunity for bin ladin to stir up sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization i do n't think you have to be a professor to see that though although some have charged chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists i failed to see this he condemns terrorism but accuses the us of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations he argues here that us foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with the us consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda even if that country is just trying to better itself without a doubt the us has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but i do n't think washington is as evil as chomsky wants the reader to believe we americans like to believe that the us is always the good guy riding in to save the day sadly all too often us intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping having said that the us is not the evil monster that chomsky portrays it either he asserts that the us has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the us has been involved in on page 9 he states in one country nicaragua washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region 's population '' the somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the sandinista rebels and the murderous national guard was dismantled therefore nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins '' the spirit of exuberance vitality and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course '' what chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the sandinistas overthrew somoza with the full support of the us government us then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the sandinistas congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government the sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting somoza as chomsky wishes the reader to believe but by supporting the marxist guerrillas in el salvador the us cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels in 1981 the us even sent thomas enders to try to end the tension he offered them a sweet deal the us would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in el salvador they refused this is was the beginning of the end for the sandinistas i do n't understand why chomsky implies that nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either the sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power they consistently denied nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised newspapers were censored religions suppressed some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed the only reason that i can think of that chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion later chomsky implies that the us ruined the healthy economy of nicaragua any economic growth that the nicaraguans experienced was due to the us because of the said aid and the efforts of the us to have their world bank debts forgiven chomsky wants the reader to believe that us conflicts are never about communism or terrorism that its just a ruse he 's wrong nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong i also wonder about his comments concerning cuba appealing to the un for help chomsky states that cuba did n't respond to the us with violent attacks within the us rather they followed the procedure required by international law chomsky appears to be implying that the noble cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the us obviously they did n't attack the us because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack keep in mind that after the cuban missile crisis che guevara one of the most influential leaders in the castro regime was furious he was angered that the soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity chomsky 's claims that cuba 's economic woes are purely a product of the us embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch did the embargo negatively impact cuba of course so much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid i fail to see how i am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and clinton admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in sudan why did n't chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on us embassies in kenya and tanzania why did n't chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant why did n't chomsky mention that the us released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked i have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but i 've reached my word limit here at amazon cheer
i am not a right winger whatsoever am against our involvement in the mid east but did read this book i ca n't say it better than alan dershowitz who commented about chomsky 's writing in general many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16
pages 38 to 97 half the book is just blank space for notes which you could just as well write in a notebook spiral the beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms with some bulletted questions here and there
president clinton 's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries it frequently appears as though the brief daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added it does provide an extensive recap of president clinton 's life events so if that 's of interest you may want to check it out
very poor analysis of west african civilizations for example ghana was a very significant soninke empire in western africa yet barely any attention at all is paid to it to make matters worse the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been founded by whites from the north '' fact is there were no whites '' to the north the only light skin berbers nearby were browns ''
i was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students a history of civilizations '' satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events fernand braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization a pretty innovative approach i thought but in so doing not only did he miss out on important details in the content he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way he assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the end ' of the subject matter the already reading experience was worsened by the choppy inadequate translation of the original french writing the lack of illustration annotations will contribute to the bewilderment and not the enlightenment of the poor reader if you were to buy this book just read chapter 1 a general review and the chapters on islam latin america usa and russia the rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information or rather lack of information and insights and having to bash your way through furthermore the book was written two decades ago and hence the information presented is not well treat it as a capsule ' of facts then
man you ca n't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied i liked the way they presented the idea of bw but it was seriously outdated they should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year
anybody buying this book to learn some bw will be very much disappointed like the way the book is organised but older stuff i ca n't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book not only they should stop selling also should recall the book
how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and can not remember a word the reader has said i am going to stick to the movie versions of anne of green gables instead of reading the rest of the books at least the movies keep your interest
being a fan of such authors as tolkien wells and lewis i figured i 'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the american west a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining i did some research and cormac mccarthy seemed to be the author to start with he got very good reviews from this site and professional critics i find it amazing that he received such great reviews this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit the book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly unexpectedly return to it i have never read a book like that before after completing this book i had found out more about the life of a prostitute than i ever wanted to know and also i received a free lesson in swearing i understand that it was custom in the west to swear and dealings with prostitutes was common but i think mccarthy went over the top this made it uninteresting and redundant then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods question marks and exclamation marks i did not see a single quotation mark and the word and '' was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly sentences were monotonous after reading this book i also felt ignorant being uneducated in the spanish language much of the dialogue i could not understand in the least bit there were entire conversations written exclusively in spanish at times when it seemed relevant i felt like i missed a lot of important information in the story i did find that at time mccarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me i do n't suppose i 'll ever read a book by cormac mccarthy again
once again gary null phd '' recycles information into another gn book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements gary null is probably the only author that carries a phd and fails to reveal where he got his ba ma and phd a quick reading of shows that gary null has nontraditional '' credentials and owns a dollar supplement company he also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters the confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables fruit and legumes would need supplements at all the only reason i could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive time consuming and costly give up so gn conveniently has dozens of vits supplements and food replacement products to fill in the gap i estimate the cost of following gn recommendations in full it would cost about 600 per person a month to prove my point gn for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a gn healthy '' chocolate bar to his portfolio gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books
let me first say that i am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book i am extremely committed to healthy food choices environmentally sound policies and all the basic values gary null ostensibly embraces i have no problem with null 's basic premise that we should consume a fresh diet although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier buy organic food when at all possible and avoid toxic household products but i am totally outraged by gary null 's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues i bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points we do n't need any more evidence that a diet low in is healthier than eating at mcdonalds this book adds nothing legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source and is far inferior to for instance the food pharmacy '' by jean carper in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce
of course i want to restore my mind and body ! the title alone made me want to read the book however most of the miraculous '' claims are supported by case studies from the doctors ' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study those who are skeptical of traditional western medicine might enjoy reading this however i found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you too good to be true usually is
this book is a waste of money i received it as a gift so i could n't return it it is full of historical mistakes and careless errors it is not worth taking the time to point them out
my first nora roberts ' book only be persistent did i complete the book it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of roberts
i 've read all of flynn 's books in fact i just picked up act of treason as i 'm reading it i 'm reminded of how disgusted i was with his last book consent to kill only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one without giving away the ending consent to kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial that being the mitch rapp saga to any real fiction writer what flynn resorts to in the book in terms of mitch 's personal relationship is quite sad it 's simply designed to keep mitch hungry '' and emotionally tattered '' so as to allow flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he 's capable of writing the book started out to be intriguing although i did ask myself how flynn intended to keep mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel but the story read like a tenth grader wrote it a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping mitch rapp and his franchise chugging along by far the worst story flynn has written to date skip this one
lee is not an be careful when reading this book recend clinical studies are not included in this book furthermore lee is widely disregarded by his peers
harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be and i was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end found out there was nothing just a worthless rant
never received the book so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost i have incurred
the author believes that france 's economy and socialism generally is admirable this against all evidence to the contrary really how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take have n't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas as socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot and rot we are expected to heed calls to admire and replicate their failures amazing read hayek von mises sowell friedman this guy here should never have been published
i was given a copy of this book when my son zachary was born as another reviewer mentioned it was quite scary reading all the things that might be wrong with him medically along with the quotes from parents the author included i 'm sure the quotes were a inclusion from the author but each and every one i would review to be extremely even bordering negative as a parent of a child with ds i can tell you that my experience has been nothing but but overwhelmingly positive my son at less than 2 years old has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others a child with down syndrome is a blessing in disguise he give to me so much more than i give to him as you wil hear from just about any parent with a ds child but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book
i am an early interventionist working with several infants and children who have down syndrome i found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading for example it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children this chart caused no end of worry to the parents i work with more accurate down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere
in one of what appears to be carole radizwill 's jabs at her and at many of the extended family she implies lee wondered what exactly her son saw in carole something along the lines of how much do they have in common beides abc '' after finishing this book i have to say i have no idea what if anything they did have in common nor more importantly what it was that first caused them to fall in love while i can understand and appreciate the author 's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship i think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place as has been commented on by many reveiwers she sounds much more passionate when she writes of carolyn bessette kennedy again not in a lesbian way but in an idealized crush way i found myself wondering if they really were as close as carole portrays or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to carolyn forever
this book was a disappointment a real textbook would actually have instruction this book is merely a collection of cases with a few scattered chapters on only buy the book if required to for a class
the author insists so far as i can tell that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some aristotelean idea of the 'premise ' which can not be violated 'love leads to death ' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love this is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot it 's absurdly reductionist maximum capacity a character 's dialogue should always be the best thing he could say what nonsense how about the mistake a common factor of life some good points on dialogue though but not worth the book i think you could write a good novel with this book but i think it would hobble a certain type of writer severely
although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any book my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise such as cheaters never win '' before you begin to write this kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers leading to work that can be preachy predictable and cliched many times the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer
with the hotplate and microwave on the cover you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items this is not the case yes there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven and even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space extensive preparation and a large number and variety of ingredients if you really do live in a dorm where you will have very little room and only a and microwave i suggest either finding another book or just making it up as you go or if like me you live in a tiny studio with no counter space and only a fridge microwave and hotplate it offers a few more options but not much most of the recipes require too much preparation and if you are concerned about energy use and safety many of the recipes also have fairly long cooking times overall i 'd say this would be a good book aimed at the beginning cook perhaps for someone who just moved into their first real apartment with a full kitchen this is not a good book for anyone with limited space and resources

i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns germs more than the other 2 and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs collapse '' a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now
a case for amillennialism understanding the end times by kim riddlebarger is the best book going on end times escape the craziness for good and buy this book hopefully you 'll get that finally it all makes sense '' understanding of what the scriptures tell of the end times
when i first started reading this book i literally devoured it from page to page believing it to be groundbreaking and a after i read it i reflected on its message and found i was n't as excited as i first thought then i thought about writing a review but had to caution against emotionalism and this kind of book certainly stirs up the pot of emotionalism steve wohlberg does hit on some sacred cows '' theologically though and i found i had some common ground with him on the rapture and the as he cited solid historical sources to support his thesis however as i continued to read on i discovered to my dismay that i 'd read some of this stuff before in the day adventist literature as a matter of fact steve wohlberg although admittedly a messianic jew has written for pacific press and other seventh day adventist press publications then there 's the issue of the way of salvation he claims that the faithful '' will be saved by trusting in christ for their salvation and keeping the 10 commandments this is solid adventist teaching and there 's no two ways around it other teachings have focused on keeping the sabbath as another legal '' requirement of salvation although after a couple of questions to him about this he stated that he did n't hold to that view scripture makes it very clear that christ lived died on the cross shed his blood for the remission of sins and rose from the dead to justify those who believe in him and as a result receive eternal life jesus also said that those who loved him would follow his commandments and he cited the two greatest commandments as loving god with all our heart soul strength and mind and loving our neighbor as ourselves nowhere does the bible teach that it 's christ plus the commandments '' to come to christ is to follow christ plus nothing and christ minus nothing he is our all in all he is the fulfillment of the law to all those who believe although ready to rate this book very high after a great deal of thought it can only be the lowest sorry steve you did n't convince me you 're either a biblical christian or a follower of white

i read this book years ago or rather tried to i 'm sure there are better examples of the truism when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail '' but not many if you 're another 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like one day at a time '' you 'll probably really really like society becomes an i myself found it to be one of the worst books i 've ever seen and in a genre glutted with and hidden agendas that 's saying a lot if there is anything we emphatically do need more of in politics it 's therapy lift your head out of your cocoon and look around you we 've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper to murder we 've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized the easily offended the oppressed '' and most of all da chyldrun '' and no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her sensitive side '' often with short sappy personal interest '' films schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize american society more uh when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys i think we 've feminized society quite enough and i 'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies too bad it had to take september to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than empathizers and nurturers we need leaders individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments and warriors and heroes of both sexes
this book is full of assumptions and generalizations some information is distorted according to the logic of the writer over 90 of the population should be already dead from addiction '' the writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful it is possible but the writer does n't make any notes about the men and women centered systems the only system that is good is the female system
13 stories 13 epitaphs is the second book by william vollmann that i 've read and i still am not quite sure what to make of him the first was butterfly stories a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in thailand chasing hookers looking for the one with a heart of gold 13 stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless jobless and addicted drugs as well as several whores it 's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society it makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable i ca n't relate with the characters and do n't find much redeeming about his stories it does n't seems like he has an overall plan it 's not necessarily a morality tale i think i 've had enough of his novels
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good better a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret '' is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles his editor chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 40 or even 50 pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera '' speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
i did n't like this book i thought it was a waste of time and money
i did not order this book and i did not authorize a charge to my credit car
tina is molested by her stepfather who she thinks is her real father until her mother finally tells her that he is n't tina is vague about the details of the abuse and does n't actually say what happened so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went she prays to god many times to make it stop why 'd he let it start in the first place but god is not listening at those times finally after many years of this abuse her mother catches them together and instead of kicking him out sends her daughter to a school out of town with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day the lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together and they do n't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he 's sorry sorry that he got caught says it 's just something about tina that makes him do it make sense the mother works at kmart and likes to have kids she does n't care about and the dad works in an office '' the rest of her growing up is fairly normal she has a boyfriend and he kisses someone else ouch she goes off the college and finds out her high school boyfriend is seeing her best friend tina does n't seem too upset by this she 's busy with college and new friends anyway then he comes to visit her tells her he got the other girl pregnant but he really loves her she quickly moves in with him the other girl 's pregnancy or resulting child is so unimportant that it is never mentioned again in due time tina gets pregnant by him and has an abortion she says she regrets it gets pregnant by him again has another abortion regrets this one too however she never talks about what her life would be like if she did have these two kids by this loser nope it just was wrong and she wishes she 'd never done it but never takes responsibility that is was her decision based on the circumstances she was in at the time having an abortion is just so wrong that you do n't have to think about the consequences of actually having the baby she seems to put the blame '' for her two abortions on society talks her unmarried sister into keeping her unplanned pregnancy breaks up with the impregnating loser meets a normal '' guy he wants to marry her they plan big wedding with white dress and bridesmaids she thinks she does n't really love him calls mother to discuss why bother mom tells her she better get married to this great guy tina decides she ought to do it in a few days before she changes her mind buys black dress to get married in has small wedding has finished college and every job she wants she gets whines about working and traveling so tired persuades husband to go back to college and get degree in engineering husband is so smart that he figures finances and tells her they can afford a house has baby girl his parents buy a crib she does n't like of all the nerve ! his mother tries to take over helping too much and tina gets frustrated but wo n't tell her off how much can a person be expected to take husband tells her she does n't have to work anymore they buy bigger newer house tina whines about packing and moving so much work gets pregnant with second baby never notices when she 's pregnant always thinks she has a stomach virus getting depressed and tired with being pregnant and cleaning house starts sitting in hot tub every night guess doctor did n't tell her this is bad for baby as it raises baby 's temperature too much already hot inside mother 's body slips and falls on icy deck not good idea to be walking on while pregnant hurts back whines some more has second baby too depressed and physically in pain to take care of self or both children medication not helping asks mom for help she refuses has to watch stocks on tv for boyfriend '' has left husband finally guess husband 's family does n't want to help now church people help some not enough for her husband begs her mom to help she does twice apparently husband can not figure out that he should put both kids in daycare while he works pick them up after work then take care of them himself when they go home just like a single mom does ! never enters his head while tina is at mom 's house not too depressed to drive or go to mom 's house mom tells her to snap out of it '' this makes tina snap for real she jumps in car drives to bridge tries to jump off cop grabs her pictures are terrible ca n't see what happened picture of car on bridge wow finally starts going to therapist but her faith '' now helps more discovers uplifting '' christian cd 's faces fact that she and mom will never have relationship the way she wants it says mom saw her as rival for husband instead of daughter she should have protected that 's true this book is short i read it at the bookstore and its main focus is if you get christ in your life your depression will be lifted but that makes no sense as she was praying and going to church all her life tina was searching yes but expecting to find the answer to her problems with god this did not help before and she seems to have tried to adjust things in her mind to make it that way after the bridge incident the whole time she needed to look inside herself yes the abuse never should have happened her mother was a terrible person and all this affected her but she wo n't deal with it wo n't get angry at mom or stepdad apparently she never sees any books or anything like that and relies solely on church and her beliefs '' to get her emotions in check and this appears to be a very ineffective solution by the way tina mentions that she can not get physically helped by reiki because it conflicts too much with the beliefs she 's had all her life the beliefs she 's had ever since she was a child molested by her stepfather tina 's not much of a one for upgrading her beliefs which leads her to feeling stuck in certain situations tina had a lot of things to be grateful for nice husband and provider did n't have to work nice house healthy kids nice college education but she is not appreciative tina 's almost constant whining about things that would seem very small to anyone else negated any effect this book could have had on me as portraying a mother depressed enough to jump off a bridge she just seemed spoiled to me for such a deep subject this book lacked substance and seemed to tiptoe around the issues there is no calling a spade a spade the whole thing is superficially written anyone who 's had to deal with real problems especially while depressed will not get '' this book
i was disappointed in the latest lincoln rhyme mystery the book had more twists than a chubby checker song and in the end they strained credibility rhyme and sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the watchmaker rhyme has met his match with the watchmaker a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for rhyme to follow running parallel to the story of the watchmaker sachs is also lead detective on her first case a case that appears to involve police corruption sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt ron pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to rhyme and sachs to solve the case the book introduces kathryn dance a visiting californian expert in kinesics the study of body language dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case there is also a hint of romance with officer sellitto which is ultimately left hanging the information about kinesics is interesting and dance is a character that could have used more development the title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar which is also a time of death the book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the watchmaker there was some fascinating information but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks the book lurches from one plot twist to the next at first it was exciting but after a while it became tedious nothing was what it seemed further i found rhyme less likeable in this book grumpy bossy pedantic and sarcastic the only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose sachs at times i found the writing clumsy deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters such as the handsome sardonic and impatient criminalist '' i found it trite to describe rhyme that way this book is not as good as earlier rhyme mysteries
adobe 's instruction book are very basic and boring get deke 's books you 'll be glad you did
i heard all of these great things about this book etc so i got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down i can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that i did not find at all entertaining the bowel movement '' chapter was totally repulsive i found it self indulgent he had a crappy upbringing that does not make for a good book
i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items which usually disuades me from a selection so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work i found it smug and written by a person with little or no empathy especially for the people he castigates for example his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the '' shrink '' bashers of the world this play for effect '' tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me
this book was horrible if it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have i am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend i read half of it suffering from a headache the entire time and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire one less copy in the world do n't waste your money i wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes this book wasted my life
if you like strange stories you will love running with scissors '' because it is just plain weird after reading this book you will have a feeling that you just returned from the twilight zone marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book the book was anything but funny i read about half up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 old was just sick i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick mentally ill characters i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
the body project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of adolescent girls and their personal body projects the main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white adolescent girl throughout american history and jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in brumberg 's book brumberg focuses on the evolution of the white female adolescent starting in the early and ending in the late an evolution of the african american adolescent also took place during these times but differently than that of their white female counterparts in order to understand black american adolescents today foundation for cultural practices must first be established brumberg never mentions the coexistence of enslaved blacks in america during the or centuries though all women have the same biological anatomy our genes vary our cultures vary so we should dispel the idea that when certain groups of women who menstruate earlier than others are abnormal or inferior brumberg reveals that this type of thought was well circulated throughout the medical community remained true during the victorian period the notion that black health was considered an expendable asset in the american medical community well through the early one major issue that brumberg avoids is the abuse of children and adolescents there is probably a close connection between the body projects that adolescents undertake and their harsh brumberg fails to expand on the greater idea that people exist who can never truly choose their identity before it first chooses them many girls are intrinsically bound to a stereotype despite possibly everyone has small things that they would like to alter about their physical appearances however americans also fail to see these body projects '' as a form a western female mutilation of which millions of women have fallen victim plastic surgery is an project that young girls obsess about this standard idea of beauty that girls manipulate themselves on must disappear before our individuality as women disappears
dick staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a jedi in the ways of the force in star wars and the walk of a christian following god in life today however he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the star wars movies and i even found a misquotation from the bible he makes good points but these details were distracting to me as i read i am not yet finished and will leave more once i am done after finishing this book it occured to me that dick staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things first he needs to the bible and get facts correct he quoted moses as saying something to joshua but moses was dead at the time and god told it to joshua second he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets he says david had uriah killed to be the only one bathsheba loved he had uriah killed to cover up his sin third he needs to the star wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book he talks about asking yoda for help in episode ii and portrays the event differently than it happens as well as bends yoda 's reaction to fit what he is trying to show this book is not what i thought it was and any christian who is young in their walk should not read this
the book seems to miss the mark it just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side
i was very excited when i came across this book i am both a christian and a star wars nut i began reading this book right away and it started slow i kept reading hoping it would really dive into some good contrast it never came i 'm sure this guy meant well but he had a very shallow knowledge of the star wars films and on the christian side everything felt like it was from a grade sunday school class i want so badly for this book to be great but it is not i wish i would have written it
from the christian stand point it just reinforces everything you read about and hear about from principle christian literature from the star wars mythology stand point this book falls well short of explaining the hypocrisy of christianity and the force '' it is impossible to have a lord of the force '' because no one is capable of such omnipotence the associated with the star wars universe warns of such concentrated power in fact if a lord '' were to exist he because staub makes no mention of a female character would probably be evil and practioner of the dark side such power and knowledge can only be achieved by domination and aggression first anakin skywalker the supposed massiah or chosen one '' is a prime example of staub 's flawed argument magically conceived anakin is equally as flawed as any other human being he ultimately commits the same flaws and the same sins any other human being would commit yet anakin gains redemption through the love of a son and the strength of a spirit not the forgivness of a god or a lord second there isnt a clear black and white that determines good and evil a lot of gray exists in the world of star wars and there are many complexities that reflect out own world complexities a jedi christian would characterize as evil and thus irrelevant staub does n't address these complexities in fact the dogmatic beliefs of christianity are the same dogmatic beliefs that ultimately destroy the jedi order by the end of episode iii and destroy the emperor in episode vi finally i do credit staub with finding the commonalities between god 's good works and the jedi order but values like compassion humility and love for one another are values shared by nearly all world religions not just christianity everything described by staub can be found in other religions not just christianity if you 're a star wars fans looking for religious guidance i recommend the dharma of star wars '' and maybe you 'll find an ultimate truth not in the form of a one true lord ''
i have been a fan of peter carey forever and have read all his work his work however has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book weird characters and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style some of his stuff almost crossed the line my life as a fake to the inintelligible but theft makes it all the way i found the characters somewhat boring and the language idioms references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases perhaps if you are a sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense but for the rest of us am really sorry to report the book is not readable i quit after reading about and for me that is unheard of i feel like i have lost at good friend
when i the reviews to this book i thought to myself this is going to be the read of the summer so naturally i went to my local bookstore and paid 24.00 a few hours later i went back and returned it it was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere i do n't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless with no execuse for its swearing literature is n't trash carey
robert putnam 's book bemoans the declne in civic participation '' among americans since its heyday in the 50 's and 60 's although few would argue that bridge clubs are n't what they used to be who would have predicted the rise of member back in 1962 this underlines the basic problem with this book it focuses too much on what constituted communities '' and activities '' in the past without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today while i agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index and participation in traditional formal organizations has declined i would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the century has risen for example while young people famously are less likely to vote in our system college students today volunteer more that any generation before them in addition while participation in mainline protestant churches has stedily declined engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically while i personally feel that the sterile suburban existance is soul crushing and the popularity of reality tv may be a sign of the apocolypse i also do n't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week while dad worked returned home to supper and went to the men 's club on tuesdays at 8. and while putnam 's basic premise may resonate with many its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument
i picked up the first book in this series the eyre affair based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed still the potential for the series seemed so large that i went ahead and read this second one too only to be even less enchanted with the franchise this is a pure sequel and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of thursday next is strict order lest one miss out of allusions to past events although on further consideration maybe it does n't matter since clearly anything can and will happen in this series and fforde is n't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway the setting is the same as the first book an alternate england in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation fresh off the events of the eyre affair '' thursday next a police officer specializing in literature related crimes such as forgeries valuable manuscript thefts and the like is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved jane eyre and changed the ending for the better when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband landen unfortunately the evil goliath corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the chronogaurd timestream police to delete landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage in the first book thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside poe 's the raven '' and it seems they want him back this a potentially interesting plot but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things fforde throws into the mix most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing thursday and are also linked to events in the first book another plotline concerns the discovery of a lost '' shakespeare play which looks to be the most important literary event of the century if thursday can authenticate it there 's also the small matter of thursday 's pregnancy and just when one is comfortable with thursday 's role as a specops litratech '' and that whole milieu she 's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of jurisfiction '' a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order finally her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out and can she help him phew ! i 've probably missed one or two elements but you get the idea fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas but the shame of it is that he ca n't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve it 's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he 's just going to move on to something else in a few pages and it 's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable as is time and place i suppose it 's all meant to be puckish good fun but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder nancy drew heroine meets a 's douglas adams the book has its occasional moments but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle and there 's absolutely no narrative tension all the literary in jokes in the world ca n't save this shambling wreck and i do n't think i 'll be moving on to the next book
this more i think about this book the more thought provoking it becomes first i find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that 's widely known practically a cliche add nothing of substance to it and actually write a book about it second i find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the golden rule applicable to business third and perhaps the most amazing of all is the fact that i actually spent my own hard earned money on this book what amazing insights did i think would be uncovered i 'll save you 9.72 and the 45 minutes it 'll take you to read this here goes unless you were raised by wolves it 's pretty likely you 've heard of the golden rule ok now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings that 's it you got it ! whew ! now that you have an extra 9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time go practice that golden rule by treating your to some ice cream
the application of the golden rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good john maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule its worldwide acceptance and how we can apply it to our everyday it was more like a walk down memory lane to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us however i do have a few concerns with maxwell 's book first there might need to be a better job at researching fletcher thoughts on relativism in his book he labels fletcher as the father of mordern day realativism quoting or rather misquoting fletcher 's statement that love can justify anything i am in not postition to defend fletcher for i am not that familiar with his work however he does not just use the term love rather he uses the term agape love coming from the ancient greek the highest and purest form of love one that god would have for us a term any minister or pastor of the christian faith would know very well second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track this links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track as it turns into an advertisement for maxwell 's corporation the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of buy buy buy our products not what i expected and was somewhat disappointed in short taking some know concepts putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored part of the disappointment is that i know this book could be better
judy wardell wrote one of the very best and first books for achieving desired weight loss thin within '' then she got married i can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative insightful writer into a fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph
i had never read a danielle steel book before and decided to give her a try given that she is so popular and has so many books published i was pretty disappointed i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic however if a book is unrealistic but and engaging i would still like it i think the biggest problem with this book is the author 's excessive repetitiveness yes i get that this character is really cold and unloving was already covered 50 pages ago ! in addition character traits could have been better conveyed through situations rather than simply stating so and so was a devoted mother '' and repeating this fact again and again and again these flaws in the author 's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book this book did not leave me wanting to read more of steel 's books it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy repetitive reading
this the first of daninell 's books i read i learnt that she was the queen of romance novel since i was a teen i 'm a little disappointed by the book because it 's really boring for most of the part it 's like reading an alternative version of princess diana 's traffic accident i realize that daniell likes to repeat herself a lot there are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds it 's also too predictable to me everything that bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all it 's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive this is the major element in the book that really turns me off i have to admit that the last part where anabelle finally convinced bill to be with her is quite touching i think steel does have her crowds of fans my boyfriend 's mother had been crying all the way thru the book
is truly the queen of repition she needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor i see that is the ongoing critism of her books i swore i was never going to read another of her soaps i ca n't stand those either but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good i 'll stick with the authours i know i like from now on and i hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and she has worn these out but she 's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers
i have all of nr books this is one of the few that i have not been able to read i have carried the hard cover book since it was first published from ma to california now to new hampshire when packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space i have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there i move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and blue smoke is going into storage that will leave room in the suitecase for her next book a jd robb i believe i was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as i did
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death i am a great fan of nora roberts and really looked forward to this book believe me it is not one of her best i started off admiring her setting and characterization of the hale family but then this went on way too long it also took way too long to get to the real story the middle of the book bogged down to the point that i had to make myself keep reading which is very unusual for nora roberts much of the plot was over the top unbelievable how many boyfriends of one person can be killed the 20 year mystic connection with bo does n't quite come off either i 'll certainly remain a great fan of roberts but no one 's perfect i guess
this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up
having read many books on various financial subjects this one is on my list as one of the top 10 wastes of time in fact i am only writting this to hopefully save you time ! warning ! when the reviews are from annonymous 'a reader ' be suspicious
i agree with much of what has already been said as far as the amount of filler and the editorial glitches and can anyone figure out the last chart table 11.1 these numbers make no sense and do n't even correspond with the info on table i began the book with some excitement but ended up feeling very uncertain about the method
i bought this book because i wanted to learn more about investment products other than common stocks instead in the book on tape i got minutes about the different types of bonds a little detail about and the frank admission that this book does n't really discuss corporate bonds '' what ! the whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 for that i must say he was prescient too bad i did n't read this in 1999 ! more time is spent describing the basics of common stocks and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds ! oh and that wrong formula for computing the ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version i actually had to rewind the tape to see if i had heard correctly
the method of btdwb is good but the book is very poor ! ! ! there is serious mistake in the method described dont forget to go to corrections to 17 simple steps to super returns '' for a further reading you can find it in amazon website editorial reviews but the correction is still containing mistake please note the gold price of the example in corrections to 17 simple steps to super returns '' !
david brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife whom he raped repeatedly terrorized certain members of his department mostly the women he harassed and tormented his wife this book could benefit from a little feminist perspective in fact it 's not that shocking to find some cops are it 's a macho culture nor is it shocking to find a chief of police beating his wife to whom after all would she report him his own department
while i appreciate what tipler was attempting to accomplish he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective skip this one !
tipler says many times as i have proved '' huh what the f is he talking about there is no proof in this stinking pile of filth he 's got an abundance of physics in the back of the 'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense but i do n't think it should matter i am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts and tipler just does n't make any sense his writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time the more books you read the sooner you know when to stop reading put the book down and read a work of fiction instead which can play with such ideas without boring you to death
i ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest tipler 's theory of immortality in a nutshell is the following 1 the planet earth and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in billion years 2 man will make and machines can windows xp do that that will colonize over millions of years our galaxay and eventually the entire universe 3 these machines will be capable of individual thoughts emotions etc and are essentially alive '' 4 as the universe begins to collapse the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe 5 all the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one super being '' at the center of the collapsing universe this super being is the omega point '' 6 the omega point via its all knowledge of all things '' will be able make emulations exact duplicates of all biospheres including earth within these emulations individual humans you and me ! will be emulated thus we will again be alive '' as these beings '' in these emulations will be unable to tell if they 're real or virtual immortality for all the book theory reeks of circular logic and assumptions it 's an interesting theory but it 's just that an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist ps tipler denies the resurection of christ and in the last chapter admits to being an aetheist i wonder if he 's a aetheist
i 'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work however is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this it 's akin to the random scribblings of a old or a canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes '' and brilliant artistry '' of the play
wright presents no new information about leaves out plenty of information about and neglects the usa side of the road to '' understanding qutb 's radicalization of islam is important to understanding why ayman and usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the usa found a use for them as an enemy what can not be neglected is the myths spread about the united states by the neoconservatives and followers of leo strauss the united states is not a unique and beautiful snowflake the liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by strauss as destructive of the society of the usa and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about us exceptionalism after the the soviet union was kicked out of afghanistan both qutb and strauss ' followers believed they were the cause of it since the cold war the us has been working off of the friend and enemy '' model of policy formulated by carl schmitt and presented the us with what schmitt called a state of exemption '' if you think jihad was the cause of ask yourself why richard clarke found bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to iraq hours after see the bbc documentary the power of nightmares '' or from secularism to jihad sayyid qutb and the foundations of radical islamism '' by adnan musallam or the political ideas of leo strauss by shadia drury for a better analysis of qutb and strauss than wright has in his book if you prefer to stick with fiction about the road to '' check out patrick johnston 's novel mission accomplished
i first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the mining hall of fame i actually know about this museum in leadville the author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of big business '' to promote their agenda this museum actually took many years of interested individuals ' efforts to create the author seems to be upset because the museum does n't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact this museum was never intended to do that there are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this the mining hall of fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the us many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the us but also the world the author is critical because the type of people he would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented and alludes to racism he uses an example of a native american discovering '' uranium in the 1950 's in new mexico and asking why this person is not in the hall of fame gee could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before after all they did mine uranium in nm for the atomic bomb during the 1940 's i did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book
lies across america '' is a wolf in sheep 's clothing disguised behind this book 's apparently innocuous political correctness lies a new form of pernicious censorship even though the author claims that he has no intent to rip down monuments much of his reasoning is deeply flawed instead of doing original research into the various subjects that he writes on like a good professor should do he summarizes a book says it presents correct conclusions and then says that the old thinking is wrong case in point is the chapter on the burning of columbia south carolina during the civil war instead of looking at all the evidence on what happened when sherman marched into the city in 1865 loewen quotes two books which he seems to think draw the correct conclusions and says that sherman really had nothing to do with burning the city thus almost all the historical markers in columbia are wrong or so loewen seems to hold not the most convincing argument loewen goes on to say interesting things in his book but goes absolutely nowhere with them for instance he says that the confederate relic room in columbia may be the least accurate museum operated by a state government anywhere in the united states '' why does he say this what evidence does he have to support this other than the museum says that sherman and his troops burned down 80 of the city another diatribe against south carolina is found in the appendix where loewen says that john calhoun has no redeeming characteristics so i suggest removing him to museums from marion square in charleston the south carolina state house calhoun college at yale the united states capitol and wherever else he sits in a place of honor '' loewen pretends to be upholding historical realism with quotes from paul fussell a real historian but in fact his true agenda is just liberal censorship we in america are fortunate that we do not have a strictly homogenous society the united states is a society founded by all different types of religions and ethnicities and we should celebrate these differences however just because we disagree with cultures and ideas long ago that does not mean they are not worth studying there are always people that we agree with and disagree with the beautiful thing about open societies like america is that we can read and listen to people that we disagree with and then make up our own minds the great jurist oliver wendell holmes wrote long ago that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out '' censorship whether propagated by liberals or conservatives can only stand in the way of this marketplace of ideas to say that an important century politician like john calhoun is not worth studying is just simply intellectually dishonest especially from a professor in conclusion a book like this should have a place in the marketplace of ideas but when it comes down to buying into loewen 's theories i 'm glad i checked it out at the library
it took me 3 years to read this book should i end the review now it 's not because i am an extremely busy person or because the book was so enormous that i read it endlessly for that long no the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it 's just not very good as excellent as lies my teacher told me was this was equally bad the book is a collection of small essays about various roadside memorials or statues or other historical tidbits that adorn the united states landscape loewen goes on to expound how incorrect all of them are in the process suggesting that now get this there is racism in this country nothing in this book is by a long shot while some essays do shed some interesting light on our history the majority of these essays can be summed up by saying that white people have treated black people and indians poorly what a surprise in his next book we may find out that the sun rises in the east i 'm utterly baffled how anyone can give this book 5 stars this is a 2 star book which narrowly escapes the fate of a single star only because some of the history here is enlightening to an extent the vast majority deals with the deep south and it 's predilection towards racism in any book which the author does n't have enough material to sufficiently back his claim he will resort to such tactics as telling one side of the story or failing to give the full history of the situation loewen does both often times leaving the essay a bare skeleton of what it might have been leading the attentive reader wondering why things do n't seem to add up on the pages of his text i feel like the motivating force of this book was to make money and little else perhaps there was a drive to create controversy but the book is so tame that it can hardly do that the pages are mostly a chore to get through as evidenced by the 3 year period it took me to get through it truth be told it may have been sitting on my night stand for 4 years either way i found it dreadfully difficult to pick it up most days entirely not worth it
this book says absolutely nothing about the condition that america is in today it says nothing about american history nor the american people it is just a collection of mindless warblings fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right i would not recommend this even for kitty litter burn it
dinesh d'souza who emigrated here from calcutta in 1978 displays a level of ignorance of american history politics economics and culture that is laughable but for the immigration reform act of 1965 which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat d'souza as their pet token yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises d'souza probably would n't even be in this country for him to accuse both pat buchanan and the rev jesse jackson of hating '' america demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse do n't bother
not only do i disagree with his opinions but some of his facts are blatently false on page 106 he refers to violence agains native americans by european settlers as isolated instances '' and not planned nor calculated had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable
this is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified there is one major problem the author talks very little about risk she recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money that 's ok and many people have made money that way many people have also lost their shirt that well as well the book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt especially for the small investor the target audience who likely does n't have much to lose she should 've included several case studies some that look those who have successfully used leverage debt and looked at some who lost everything then she could 've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light saying almost nothing about the risks involved this is all well for her she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country but there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties but everything else as well any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk it 's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards such an approach is bad medicine and thomas ' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt and for that reason i took off 3 stars beyond that it 's a very good starter book
i truly feel sorry for pynchon knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life by all means if you want to read it get it from the library as i strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery does anyone really care that a man 's sexual episodes predict german v rockets falling on england is it really important to world literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from the intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same great thinkers that believe ulysses by james joyce is the best novel of all time i would rather read the worse writing of de balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels both these novels '' are truly sound and fury signifying nothing ''
i lived in germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station someone had just walked off and left it after about ten pages realizing that pynchon was an intellectual artist i secured it a trash can where no one could find it i like to think i protect the public from pollution
rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite perfectly exemplifies the great con a chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed so much like a certain nostradomus there are two principle types of literay work 1. that which is to be read and of course 2. that which is to be carted about the title clearly visible with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner 's face gravity 's rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category you see i 've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur poet here is an example of my work ball kite wolf sky space heart moon expand window flowing profound pompous gravity 's rainbow you see i 'm quite the literary genius somebody give me an award ! ! ! what you fools fail to realize is that the style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity
every reviewer rates this an exceptional book and every reviewer has only rated one book this one is n't that strange rhetorical question i read a great many reviews of trading books go to a book by elder or one of the other market gurus and you 'll find reviewers who have read and reviewed scads of trading books there 's of course no way for me to know but maybe the author 's real talent is writing trading book reviews
the history of the book when it was published tells it all after a media blitz and great anticipation with what would be written due to brando pocketing an absolutely huge advance the sales were so abysmal that it was discounted by or more less than two weeks after sitting mostly unsold on store shelves it was supposed to be the reflections of arguably the greatest actor of his generation but unfortunately songs my mother taught me is nothing but with a text that can be read skimmed very quickly the only thing i determined was brando very early in the writing process decided he was going to be as difficult on this set '' as he reportedly was with most of his film directors next to gerald ford 's brief and boring book published after his controversial presidency songs my mother taught me is perhaps the most disappointing publication by a major public figure in the latter portion of the last century
this book was a huge dissapointment every single layout was the same arrange your sofa and loveseat facing each other throw a crappy plant against the wall the pictures were dated looking and in black and white there is nothing this book has to offer that you can not glean from watching 1 evening of hgtv
yes i bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing first i was first disappointed by the style of the author the text rambled with anecdotes that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter unfortunately those chapters read like the earlier ones second i was surprised to find of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and authors the anecdotes are depressing not hopeful quite honestly reading about hundreds of authors each of who sounded like job in their trials was depressing given i would n't fancy myself as a future grisham or rowling or whatever reading awful stories about how they almost did n't make it do n't inspire hope books i have enjoyed much more include zinsser on writing well '' which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction stephen king 's combination autobiography and how to on writing '' and of course keeping track of the guest columns in the new york times on
i have received your new book against the human race and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs in reading your book to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves '' voltaire 1755
among the reviewers i am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement it is a mixture of facts and speculation with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them there is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded and i have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be in fact this is a exercise in historical erudition i do n't care what anybody else says this is a philosophy rather than history book the author gives a lot of facts but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts the author tries to integrate almost everything under the sun into this tome and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information
i 'm thankful that i was able to get this book at the library and did n't spend 15.00 buying it i own the blue day book by the same author and i think it 's fantastic and it cheers me up right away he should have stopped with that book it claims to be a witty book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who 's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way the only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures it did have one thought that i really liked some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge if that 's true then why do smart people dress so badly quot
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels '' and because i 'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium not on the mound on the field this book was published posthumously and shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose prose that was excellent in killer angels '' it 's unfortunate there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author 's other book
first of all i did not exactly 'read ' this biography instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way and still been able to read many more technology related books i had great expectations from this book having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson richard carwardine or doris goodwin i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character in this context i find mr mccullough 's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america i also enjoy direct quotes from letters speaches autobiographies as they help me refine my impressions of the context the period the relationships to contemporary characters surounding a promonent figure usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams ' time and i missed 'hearing ' the voice of john adams instead this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author finally having read other biographies of the founding fathers i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin all in all my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions had i known that i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough 's fictional work
i think i know how this book was written a whole lot of cut and paste from law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in if you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law fine but this is not the series to do it in
unlike the rest of the rich dad books that i 've read which were for the most part fantastic this book was terrible michael lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field but he is an absolutely horrendous writer the intro by robert kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of ip protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me and no real life examples of anything just references to a couple hypothetical horror stories '' that he relays at the beginning of the book the only reason i gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least i was able to get some basic definitions of ip terms down but i guess i could 've gotten that from a dictionary too
although i have found robert kiyosaki 's books to be excellent i am so unimpressed bored and resentful of this book basically it is almost 300 pages of this phrase right here get professional help '' done you have now read the book i agree with many of the other reviews here in that it really is n't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas but only helpful to kiyosaki and the author this is an advisor '' series book and it has made me skeptical of the rest of them sales dogs is also not helpful unless you are already experienced in sales
this book was on somebody 's listmania for sea turtles so i hunted it down it is only vaguely about sea turtles in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book and then he disappears so it 's obvious that he was involved in the crime there are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable i wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and i ended up skimming the whole thing looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction skip this book and send your 6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead
when i bought this book i did n't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of friedman 's collumns in the times i think friedman is a great author with lots of great insights but he is n't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as i would have liked in a bunch of detached word segments since the sections are arranged chronologically there also is n't the opportunity to tie the themes together if you really like friedman then it 's worth a read but if you are in it for just one i 'd read the lexus and the olive tree first it is by far his best
the only thing milton friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper ayn rand would have loved friedman 's disdain for the poor for anyone in fact lacking the initiative '' famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which barry goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a southwest ghetto and says why do n't you show some initiative why do n't you go out and inherit a department store like i did '' if you think the status quo was ordained by god or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with this book is for you if not start reading trotsky lenin and all the people with vision compassion and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet
not very scary too long and poor character development there are a lot of good reviews about the book maybe i missed something
ripping off king but with more sex shallower characters and a hollywood ending leave it on the shelf
the press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit unfortunately it did not live up to that notice the author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously
i could n't even begin to count all the things stanley coren gets wrong in the intelligence of dogs for instance in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they ca n't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin the first is clearly way beyond a dog 's capacity while the second is something which comes totally natural to them how did coren get things so backwards and the intelligence '' tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test or game while you 're doing it for instance i tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat i 'd still be waiting if i had n't decided he 'd never look under that towel then i tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys then i hid it under the towel and it took him less than a second to get that toy so my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of coren 's intelligence spectrum this is just one example by the way the whole idea of testing a dog 's iq like this is bogus and do n't get me started on coren 's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth granted he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there 's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy or an alpha wolf or the rest of that alpha nonsense though i doubt if even that data would change coren 's mind after all he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal 's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly signifies submission to the pack leader '' really dogs use signifiers '' now the funny thing is shortly after reading that passage i saw a wolf documentary on tv and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what coren recommends ! he rolled over on his back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose ! they loved it ! so i tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog an alpha male if there ever was one and he loved it and later that night on our last walk he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before i 'd mimicked the papa wolf 's behavior again coren had everything exactly backwards to reality this through the looking glass '' quality persists throughout the book with coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical symbolic and conceptual thinking i 'm sorry i love dogs and i think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected but the abilities they do have are geared for being a dog not a with four legs and a tail for one thing fully one third of a dog 's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information and none to processing symbols and concepts i think coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book
i read about one hundred pages and then when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding i quit this was my first king book and i am not rushing out to buy another one especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages is it any wonder that it is selling on amazon for a penny actually i would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair
a great portion of the book is very boring i really felt like rushing through the book i do n't recommend this book to other
i ca n't believe people are actually raving about this book i was so offended by the inappropriate language that i could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story the main character is acting like she is 3 rather than 32. this is hardly destined to be a classic and i would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste
good golly this is a terrible book ! i endured the first 100 pages hoping it would get better and when it did n't i skimmed to the end the plot is vapid the writing is choppy and awkward and i could guess the outcome by page 15. rich plows through the story not really explaining or developing anything seemingly writing down the first idea that pops into her head her lame attempts at humor are just that lame there is no character development or realism here this is a book where total strangers become best friends in a five minute phone call loving parents disown their daughter because she is trapped in an abusive relationship a names all her bottles of scotch albert '' and terms like '' and '' are meant to convey that a character is falling in love one of the things i really hate is when authors serve up a perfect character one absolutely devoid of flaws or realistic human behavior in an attempt to make the readers care rich has swung too far the other way and has developed one of the most loathsome and irritating protagonists i have ever had the misfortune to meet wanda is a selfish obnoxious brat and by the end of the first chapter i was earnestly rooting for her complete and total demise the other character 's sudden affections for her are wholly without merit and seem contrived to say the least the front and back covers are littered with glowing tributes by other authors if they really think this is good writing i 'll make sure to avoid their works as well as rich 's the author 's note brags that the first draft of this book was written in 25 days i believe it maybe she should take a bit more time with her next attempt if there is one
i came across this book when advising a friend 's child who was researching careers and was using this book on the plus side the book does contain info on basic job search skills i would say that most if not all of it is now widely available via the internet very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers some of it was just outdated but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being dangerous '' for a reader with little knowledge or experience and who would choose to spend pursuing a career based on the info in this book i would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice
sorry i just can not believe that the humorous '' and honest '' approaches recommended in this book will work it all seems very idealistic flaky and undignified i value honesty and humor too ! but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum i would find someone using these strategies very the words sense of entitlement '' come to mind and i am not conservative so what would a conservative employer think
i generally like david sedaris in fact he 's one of my favorites but when his stories veer off into the death of children almost gratuitously i ca n't see the humor this is please note the first book of his that i have n't enjoyed but it 's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me
perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug are n't i hilarious '' tone of this book note it is entirely possible that i am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book or even to identify the humor in the book the story of the two families competing with each other to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar and donating various organs was the train wreck of the holiday tales although it may have been the story about the preacher i ca n't say for sure because i gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely so in fact perhaps the story is not about a preacher i 'll never know neither should you i think it 's fair to say that the condescending narrator of these tales simply could n't bring himself to care about his characters they 're simply dimensionless cliched props the suburban woman the socially competitive neighbors that should immediately journey to oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which sedaris has seen fit to deprive them speaking of hearts and brains this book could use a hefty dose of those too
dow '' wants you to believe him this time no really he means it right in 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust i think that 's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust this guy is amazing
stephen king is a master of suspense but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece ' i 'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel i found it much too long and the character development is extensive and wonderful but if i had to read about one more commitee meeting i was going to throw the book out the door near the book 's end i was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop the great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length in the end i understood why his editors cut it down i had much more fun reading salem 's lot
this is the first ds book that i have read in about 20 years it made me realize why did i try again can i really find a book centered around a 70 year old male real i wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin i would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance coop only dates 20 something 's he has a 20 something porn star him that she is pregnant with his child this does n't bother his new girlfriend an early 30 's resident pediatrician who works in icu with preemies at all who tells him to have her get an abortion '' a bit too for me coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful sexy i had a hard time getting into this premise the way ds totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters every character is of course extremely wealthy even though several are hiding it most characters are extremely beautiful look many years younger than they are i realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for ds
i had not read danielle steel in several years i found the cottage to be shallow implausible and completely predictable i was very disappointed with this work
i read this book after reading what to expect when you 're expecting '' and was very disappointed i liked expecting '' most likely because while pregnancies differ the biology is pretty much the same for everyone so it 's hard to miswrite pregnancy however after reading first year '' i have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child 's behavior or abilities i know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different but i 'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk i 'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that i want my son to help clean up if i hand him a paper towel additionally the book does not always offer a good answer to a question the answer usually comes in the form of some babies will some babies wo n't '' how is that helpful ! ! after noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false i finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy in long i do not recommend this book to anyone particularly a first time mother
this is a sweet '' book that is very reassuring and interesting to read if you do n't have anything better to do but as a mom who has time for this do n't we all look up things in a state of diress hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible well you wo n't find that here this book is full of very nonspecific sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style the whole book is written in long paragraphs there are very few tables or charts it 's very wordy just to give you an example i looked up fluoride supplementation it addresses the topic using nearly a full page but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age ! more concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician ari brown 's baby 411 '' ! i gave this book one star because aside from being too general some of the information in it is outdated or in the category of old wives tales '' ! save your money and skip the what to expect '' book
i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature some of the pages were blank having not even been printed i figure the book was a total loss of money spent
marlon brando once said that his friends do n't write books about him so what does that make englund marlon said about carlo fiore a once questionable friend that he probably wrote his book about marlon because that 's all he had left the same seems to apply to englund i mean why describe the gory details of marlon 's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon seriously would a real 'friend ' have done such a thing why not leave us with some glorious memory of marlon as a true friend would i mean without the help of englund 's book marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the brando legend if marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma why we love him and i believe he did it on purpose what gives this closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend he 's a jerk to me but that 's just my opinion would alice marchak marlon 's assistant or jocelyn marlon 's sister ever write a book about marlon i do n't think so and they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something anything about marlon they did n't because people who truly love you do n't do that englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life but not at all in death that is the lowest of all the slimballs because marlon probably died thinking this was his friend not ! ! ! now that i think about it while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now marlon in all his glorious brilliance to the end may have set this guy up knowing his greed would lead him to go public with marlon 's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is now that sounds like a marlon prank being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this lifelong friend 's heart obviously marlon knew englund and that he was n't a friend marlon knew englund would prove his greed along with his disloyalty by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of marlon 's last night when marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a friend '' the ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate way to go marlon ! you were a genius to the end i see clearly this bum for what he is englund said that even on his death bed marlon said f death '' well i say even on his death bed marlon said f you georgie ''
a real downer i realize marlon brando 's life had many sadnesses but this book really seemed to dwell on them mr englund told of how he thought i wanted to hear how mr brando thought the ending really ticked me off i saw no need for the story of butch the dog a too sad story i do agree with the review by book review weekly
some of the other alex rider books may have been a little predictable but ark angel is by far the worst book in the series as if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head is n't bad enough this book really jumps the shark '' not only does anthony horowitz yet again use the corrupt rich guy '' plot this may have something to do with his childhood but at the end of the book alex gets launched into space save your 15 and buy maximum ride by james patterson or a scott westerfeld book instead
this book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie patton '' based on ladislas ' book it contains typos such as 'd day ' and also does not give any insight into the man connecting patton to deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two men patton did not consider war 'great ' per se ' and should not be idolized he enjoyed it and was excellent at it however he agonized over the men he lost perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make today
this book is only a shadow of what bukowski can do i was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work these poems are all ones that he would have never released had he been alive they have no charm and show nothing of his talent his wife i guess thought they were good enough to be released i beg to differ if you want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check out betting on the muse which is an amazing book
f this industry crap poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack title gives them and remember this doctor '' is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives so why do you let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life
insane that anyone would ascribe to these ideas let alone actually trying to apply them i 've listened to the tapes read the books became more incensed as i went along yes there are differences between the sexes but this guy does n't come close to getting it right and if you 're a man following his advice then you can write off having a with an intelligent woman this fool creates escapes '' and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men claiming that it 's innate to the male gender and would suggest that their women forgive them for it ! sure forgive them expect them to grow up at some point ! i support equal respect for men from women and vice versa if i catch you flirting with other women and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book i 'll shove mister not doctor gray 's book where the sun do n't shine for those looking for a better appraisal than mine please google the rebuttal from uranus they really capture the truth
this book rests entirely on one idea with which you are teased from the very beginning by the middle it can be pretty much guessed but you still have a long way to go before the last sentence finally confirms your worst suspicions the fact that the main character is the head of the most powerful investigative agency on the planet is also a spoiler because he can too easily get what he needs at every twist and turn a further aspect that irritated me was the fact that the authors a couple writing under one name made several mistakes about things italian italy is where a good deal of the book takes place all of which could have been easily researched i might be too demanding considering that this is meant for pure entertainment but even when i read books i expect some attention to detail i seriously doubt that i will ever pick out a john case again
not a profound book lots of to make a few good points a fast and fun read
as a lecturer of i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted
the author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard happenings his intent seems to be to say the internet changes becomes a social leveller youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things but also new processes new paradigms and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so he uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by sec another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast yet another writing programs to napsterize everything he indicates flattening '' of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations and has this concept of insiders '' being unseated by outsiders '' due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined developed and brought to market thanks to the internet there is some truth to his observations but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend it is of course true that the internet gives access '' and freedom '' renewed relevance i like to think of it as digital democratization '' of society
when i first discovered the stephanie plum series i started with four to score then backtracked i was delighted with the character of stephanie plum although she was down on her luck she was plucky endearing and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered in earlier books stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy held her own in her on again relationship with boyfriend cop joe morelli and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with ranger she even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin vinnie her and her nemesis joyce barnhardt but now stephanie plum has morphed into someone who is selfish stubborn and just plain stupid she has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself in ten big ones stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm deciding that joe 's concern for her safety is too oppressive she moves out of his house and into ranger 's unoccupied apartment in one of her silliest schemes yet she wrangles lula and connie into helping her kidnap a gang member putting them all in jeopardy and as her sister 's nuptuals approach stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious all this is played for laughs but it misses the mark the plot is deja vu the characters predictable sadly the loveable characters created long ago by evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up never change and they go through similar events again and again come on bring back the old stephanie and give morelli something to do other than walk his dog bob and answer his cell phone i 'm taking a vacation from this series bring on james patterson laurie king lisa gardner
like many of the readers i agree that evanovich seems to have run out of ideas the series could be written by a twelve year old just give them a blow up car eat donuts feed rex a of pizza eat donuts vascilate between ranger and joe eat six tastykakes you get the idea evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book though she added in ranger 's shower gel to the list it was only mentioned every other paragraph might i add that i have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does seriously the books went downhill after the sixth installment if evanovich can not expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over perhaps she should consider ending the series
this poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each european country then describe the experiences of each country with its islamic radicals and their families instead there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative the poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the european countries can improve the situation in the future the author seems to feel that the united states has a much better handle on immigration than the european countries he fails to note that the also has inconsistencies and problems in how it handles immigration this book is an example of a first draft that should have received far better treatment during the editorial process it should have been improved beyond simply an emotional screed into a book that enables readers to see what policies seem most effective in integrating immigrants into the body politic and which leave immigrants as separate poor and disillusioned groupings vulnerable to exploitation by organizations trying to undermine the european countries
this book really is an insult it 's lesson '' and assignments '' are horrible they ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book in a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read
i had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course unfortunately the instructor never even flipped through it it is by far the worst photography book really the worst book i have ever purchased ! there are typo 's the example photos '' and instruction sometime are not the same the projects are lame and really teach nothing i would not recommend this book under any circumstances avoid at all cost ! ! !
how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and can not remember a word the reader has said i am going to stick to the movie versions of anne of green gables instead of reading the rest of the books at least the movies keep your interest
i read this book i do n't remember how many years back i think about 15 years ago and just remembering makes me nauseous for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point i was younger naiver and i got engaged i confess that clever author no doubt to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead just wandering around and playing with analogies i had the time back then i guess today i only have the time to write a review stating how surprised i am today i could finish this kind of book i ca n't speak for anyone else suffice to say i was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands
those of us who have been to college usually know at least one crazy guy who was always the life of the party and constantly entertained the campus with his antics tucker max is not one of these people tucker is nothing more than a standard belligerent mean drunk the type of guy who always ends up trying to start fights with people for no reason and then runs away if it actually comes to blows the type of guy who is constantly bragging about how much he gets when no one has ever seen him so much as kiss a girl i kept expecting tucker to blurt out my dad totally owns a dealership ! '' nothing truly insane happens in this book it 's mainly just tucker and his buddies getting drunk and being jerks towards everyone they encounter generally the typical behavior you might expect from someone who refers to himself in the third person in most of these stories tucker makes himself out to be some sort of supermack that can screw any girl in a matter of seconds this just seems a bit off for a guy whose original claim to fame involved trying to land a girlfriend online i almost forgot to mention tucker max has been outed as a fraud by opie and anthony and by the miami herald none of these stories are true he is just another james frey
journey to the land of no '' is a memoir of a jewish girl growing up in iran during the revolution the book describes what her life and the life of her family was like before and after this cataclysmic event having developed an unaccountable interest in the iranian revolution during the past year i have read perhaps a dozen books about this subject hakakian 's book while not bad would have to be toward the bottom of the list of books you should read about this subject it just did n't grab me and certainly there has been no shortage of books written by women who lived in iran during the revolution and have since escaped but if you 're only going to read one or two there is much better fare out there reading lolita in tehran '' is searing and unforgettable and the graphic novel persepolis '' is simply excoriating this latter would be at the top of said list yeah the competition is pretty stiff these days the bar for writing an i 'm an iranian exile and here 's why '' book has been set incredibly high by so much good stuff out there now and hakakian 's effort does n't quite measure up anyhow compared to harrowing books like those hakakian 's story is dare i say it occasionally it is tenderly written but i left the book feeling that she had little to say and because at least compared to other authors writing about the same subject little remarkable happened to her what is most regrettable about the book i suppose is that hakakian 's jewishness is almost incidental to her tale this is sad she certainly mentions that she was jewish and this does form the cornerstone for a few events in the story but basically what happens to her and her family could have happened to pretty much any iranian during that time and this is regrettable because the jewish angle was the one really original thing this book had going for it and the author i must aver failed to really explore it or make it come alive in fact so forgettable is the whole outing that a few weeks after having read this book i am unable to recall a single incident from it
tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds i am invested in the vanguard s p 500 index as well as other index funds but this is a bit too much if you understand the concept of indexing save some cash and skip this book
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good better a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret '' is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles his editor chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 40 or even 50 pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera '' speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the century byatt in all her annoyingly feminist glory has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet each and every character is lacking in charisma humour and in fact any other attractive facet about their personality offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy thus leaving no hero so necessary to such a story then there 's the literature which was all unfortunately written by the woman herself to interlink the text with poetry and letters is admittedly a good idea but the quality is dire could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most and chapter 10 just too long so unneccessary this is without a doubt the single worst book i have ever had the misfortune to read and would recommend it to other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea
great expectations was a mediocre book i was not impressed i had to read this book for my grade honors english class it was too long and boring i see were dickens was trying to go with the suspense but it just made the book monotonous and boring the uncanny coincidences just did not seem real it 's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense but this was just overkill every chapter was boring i got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with estella for the whole book also the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time who cares about wemmick 's stupid plays this could all be summed up in a couple of page short story in conclusion this is another swing and a miss for dickens stay far away from this book ! if you want to read a good dickens story read a christmas carol '' and nothing else written by charles dickens
i love to read great books like brave new world by aldous huxley or far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy i love the aeneid by virgil the odyssey by homer i read both long versions of les miserables and the hunchback of norte dame by victor hugo i read the rise and fall of the roman empire by gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so i love to read but great expectations was a great disappointment ! i was somewhat amused until chapter ten where i felt the book became i was also disappointed in tale of two cities i could not endure the first two chapters ! dickens did a fine job on the christmas carol but i will never read another of his books
i hate this book it is extremely boring and it is way too long there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar do not read this unless forced to i like to read but this nearly put me to sleep avoid at all cost
this book was very boring details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it a poll was taken and about 73 of the students in the school liked this book what does that show about the book
this book is so lame i regret every minute i spent reading it
bette lives in manhattan has a close knit group of friends enjoys romance novels and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity iq everyone worth knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations and finds romance real and fictional along the way maybe it 's just me but bette seems to have problems many people would love to suffer '' through although told a lot of things about her i never got the feeling i could really picture bette or understand what she wanted even in the end her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random still if you liked the devil wears prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances you will probably enjoy everyone worth knowing
the addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher instead visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre look in the acknowledgments '' section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author 's agent and the book 's editor those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site etc and give them a call if they are receptive to your idea send them a formal proposal i have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation as one other reviewer noted the author is an agent call him up and see how receptive he is to you you might as well try looking for elvis in the supermarket
this book really sucked ! save your money ! the i have tried to contact herman about some of the problems i have encountered with the contact addresses he provided he has yet to respond meanwhile i have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance one other note many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent and had n't been for quite sometime
sure the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in sing sing but of the five queries i sent out based on the information in this book two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown maybe i picked the only five bad addresses in the book or maybe current it isn't
the contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book if you want names and addresses use the internet if you want a book that can actually help you get published read the square guide to publishing your book by rudy shur
and when did n't buy a new edition and i got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls i got published i know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition all i can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has lol but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track this book wo n't help you do it
this is a repeat of the first 2 books for the most part i do understand that the rich dad classics '' are n't meant for tips and specific methods of making money but rather a rich mindset mineset but any specifics no they are his best kept secrets you would have to attend his money making seminars spend more money it 's understandable to emphasize the importance of mindset in a book or two and i did really enjoy the original rich dad poor dad '' but it seems like all of his books are just about the mindset what good is a mindset if there is no real direction in executing it do n't waste your time reading this book it 's also the thickest of the three if you have n't already done so however read the original rich dad poor dad
i am not a fan of robert kiyosaki i find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense while he introduces some worthwhile ideas i do n't think he develops them enough to be useful i also do n't like the tone or context out of which this writer expresses himself i find that it comes across as unfeeling manipulative and selfish i do n't have anything against seeking out wealth however i think the means to that end is important in my opinion this author ignores that important fact and at the same time does not supply the detail that people are looking for or need to achieve their financial goals in short i think this book is a waste of money there are many other books that can give you more useful information in less space which is delivered from a more humane emotional space
i 'll put my opinion first so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character '' people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you how well can you predict what people in your own country will do would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as barzini i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the inside view '' the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history patterns religion family the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family the state italian modes of achieving success the split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were and interesting but his portrayal of italian character '' is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you
i am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book honestly it was a complete waste of my time to quote a friend it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar if you are a fan of pedestrian writing plots and hackneyed character development this is your book
some of the reacher novels such as the killing floor have been incredibly good but i was genuinely disappointed in this one the author describes reacher as heroic a loner but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told phrases such as back in the day '' get repeated much too often reacher has become a caricature of himself
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various administrations in that sense it is the story of two cities miami and washington and two peoples americans and cubans i have an objection though with the style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end readers it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book
exiled cubans in miami up to 1987. this is real old stuff i wonder why this book is still being published felt like a collection of shorter magazine newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book many long disjointed sentences could use an updating there must be better books out there about this topic
free trade is great when you 're rich and powerful enough to ram it down the throat of other nations the multinationals who benefit from massive subsidies aeronautics computers metallurgy you name it are more than happy to have members of the bought priesthood of academia distill fantasies about the joys of the alleged free market '' not a word in this book about the public subsidies that become private profits with a huge military and growing for the millions of people who are superfluous to the plans being made undemocratically of course in geneva and bonn corporate tyranny and its servants are destroying the environment labor protections the public sphere and cultural diversity goebbels would be impressed
i bought and downloaded the ebook of this famous book for my research it is not usable most of the text is missing i have never seen such a bad scanning result unbelievable
ralph ketcham certainly some respect i had for him when he in the middle of patrick henry 's speech inserted here henry strongly and pathetically expatiated on the probability of the president 's enslaving america '' if it were not for the fact that i 've already highlighted and marked up this edition i would buy a different version and use that as my primary source ketcham 's remarks were not in good taste nor was it proper historical method to simply leave out an argument from patrick henry thereby disallowing a following historian to examine and evaluate its merits about four weeks after i wrote the post above i discovered that the insert mentioned above was not ketcham 's doing but rather the side note of a journalist present at the time of henry 's speach at the virginia convention my apologies to ketcham although he should have inserted a footnote to make the readers aware of what appears to be an awful bias unfortunately amazon does n't allow users to edit their ratings and so this version of the papers will remain at 1 star from me although it should be a 4 or 5. regards brandon harnis
i had rated this book a two '' in relation to other koontz books i have read the book is entertaining enough but is not very unique in relation to other books that koontz has written koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one i believe koontz tries to express certain generalties some of which have moral and religious undertones in the end good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature destroys itself love is worth fighting and dieing for love is stronger than evil what does not kill you makes you stronger evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries the key to happiness is love not material gain evil lurks where you least expect it
this book is like the 'da vinci code ' for sharepoint it has a lot of information a lot of information the problem is the layout and order of presentation in the book make it almost impossible to read and find information loading the included disk is a requirement use the pdf and search electronically for the information because the printed index is incredibly lacking because it is so hard to find stuff one thinks that ms is trying to hide information or that critical information was left out good resource but be prepared for a continent spanning search for information that will takes days leave you bedraggled and make you think you 've solved centuries old mysteries once you finally find what you are looking for pack lightly carry currency and perhaps a firearm for the book share point machine self your choice
sharepoint as a technology is a tremendous product this book however does not come close to doing it justice i found the verbiage to be incoherent in various places and occasionally terms were simply never defined further at one point the author says at the time we had to go to press with this chapter the information on how to use microsoft sharepoint server 2003 extranets was in the beta stages of being written '' when i purchased this book about sharepoint products and technologies i assumed the author would be able to write about sharepoint portal server 2003 without requiring other authors to pave the way in short this book seems to be a repurposing of information from other sources in a fashion consequently i can not recommend it
i was n't too into this one i 'm a big fan of steinbeck 's fiction but this memoir is rather dull i was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of america at the time he wrote it but as an older man as he even admits he is n't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths the ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he does n't have too much to say the one highlight was the last couple of chapters when he goes to the south new orleans and witnesses all the slimy seperatists as they scream and holler with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools he is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking as much as a mediocre work as it was i did take an interest in it because i am a fan of steinbeck it was cool to hear him write a memoir other steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them i recommend it just on that basis as long as you take into account the stuff i said above if you have n't read steinbeck please start with the grapes of wrath '' or tortilla flat '' those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this
this book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots it devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human however i feel that the book falls short on several aspects and i found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section i thought i would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index ! as such the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots for the 20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index having some experience with other parrots and with other books i find the book lacking and plain i guess the book will appeal to the types and those who just want to have a generic guide of how parrots behave for those of us that want to be our parrots best friend the book falls way short of its goal
i have recently finished this disaster of a novel for a college honors course disability through autobiography '' while attempting to read this book my frustration took over and in a couple of instances resulted in the book being thrown across the room much of the book seems a criticism of those that are not blind as well as the depictions of the blind by those who are not blind namely authors and hollywood directors i can think of a much better topic for a book than at random quotes in movies books and social groups kleege seems to only show the ability for a blind person to criticize those who are not blind and may not completely understand what blindness is although i have taken many courses that focus intensely on accepting those with disablilities in society i find it very difficult to accept severe cynicism no matter what disability the author may have
i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver i knew the rest of the story it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing the story 's decent the text flows nicely and the suspension of disbelief is strong but where did nick 's originality go where 's the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook a walk to remember and nights in rodanthe it seems like he 's run out of steam or did n't care too much about this one a decent book to read but do n't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work
the concept of this book could 've worked but sparks did n't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track it 's painfully obvious who is driving the car the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying as is their relationship interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms and the ending to the story is laughable i wo n't give it away but i 'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages i doubt i can read another sparks novel again
i have a hard time understanding what it is that i dislike about the novel i dislike it almost as much as the movie i have been a loyal follower of smiley and some more after that once the cold war was over jlc had to look for a new realm i tried to follow him but gave up with the kaukasian troubles forgot the name of the book maybe it is this jlc 's trade mark his usp is the evilness of the other side with the kgb that worked perfectly his readers were willing to stay with him and believe him now he is transferring the kgb style to all sorts of other badies i think it does not work any more it is not that i trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated i do not what i do not like i guess is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies tess in this story seems to be the normal who falls foul with the baddies that is more ok in the book than in the movie there for my eyes rachel weisz does herself discredit what is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way jlc gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations
i am a long time fan of le carre have read and loved all his books until this one i just could not summon the interest to finish it yes i 'm sort of curious about why this guy 's wife was killed but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there i was on vacation and had nothing else to do yet still i could not wade through this book i got about half way through did i quit reading too soon did it suddenly pick up after that if you 're new to john le carre start with an earlier book seriously because he 's a wonderful writer really
i was very interested in this product when i read the description however after recieving the product was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar if you have any sense of intergrity ignore this product the author must me one of the biggest decievers out there to put such effort in this product
this man obviously knows nothing about human behavior most people know that just because someone ca n't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest in more cases than not they simply have low are very and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or i might do when asked to do improv this man himself is a manipulator and a liar he 's manipulating you to get this book taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience lying and hypnotizing '' people in order to get the truth out of them is far less effective than being honest yourself if you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars you will start to have an understanding of people 's energies if you just pay attention
i bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation i feel that most of what i read is simply not factual as a person i feel strongly that i would not want to tell anyone that i knew the author or was his friend maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience
this book is an utterly corrupt crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them to live under a constant cloud of suspicion and to essentially ruin your personal relationships shall i give you an example from page 122 you and a friend are deciding on what movie to see you suggest 'lost in paradise ' but your friend who does n't want to see this offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and did n't like it you then say 'oh well if no one in your office liked it i guess it 's probably no good ' if she lets it go at that not correcting you then you know she lied initially '' emphasis mine excuse me what kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know ' your friend is a liar because she does n't want to see a movie a little earlier a technique called insert a false fact '' shows up insert a false fact is n't that known as lying and this in the context of a party no less hoo boy start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars you 're gon na wind up friendless pretty quick if you just tell the truth you 'll be amazed at the nice people you meet who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation trust me if you have a moral compass you do n't need this rag
boring and irritating not one character is likable and not one character is
brent offers a guarantee at his events where he would give a reader a dollar if they came up with his book and told them it was boring after reading the book i am ready for my dollar
this guide is honestly pretty useless any tom dick or harry knows about wrigleyville boystown and well the rest of lakeview anyone can tell you that the heart of lincoln park is well lincoln avenue but why for the life of me ca n't i find much on bridgeport mayor daley liked it well enough but hey the nft guys ca n't be bothered with the facts where 's anything west of western i guess humboldt park and albany park are n't worth the time which is too bad because it completely leaves out mention of some of the best bars and music clubs in the city not to mention some of the easiest to navigate streets if you 're a tourist looking for lowest common denominator style travel books then yes i guess the nft is a little better than average but when i saw how useless this thing was when a freshly moved in friend bought one i knew that this is for tourists and tourists only you 're better off with the irreverent guide heck they might actually list an address for the empty
had to stop about of the way through it and give it away
as a white man this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it if an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published ! i am tired of the double standard ! thank god i did n't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library
when professor polk describes the sweep of history in iraq he is at his best but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts much of the political ranting is supposition marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work the ranting gets especially tedious towards the end my advice read the first part and skip the last half
i was very excited about this book before i started to read it polk appeared to have flawless credentials surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on iraq unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met let 's start witht the obvious the subtitle of this book begins as the whole sweep of iraqi history '' the book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving physically the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average to be sure no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of iraqi history but of all the iraqi history books i have read or referenced this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country i would recommend anderson and stansfield 's book as an example of one of the best books in this area the way polk has the book organized it would be reasonable to have high hopes there are six chapters ancient iraq islamic iraq british iraq revolutionary iraq american iraq and whose iraq he appears to have the important bases covered but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and presentation of iraq 's history at least at the governmental level another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book from an academic standpoint this is baffling his experience in the field notwithstanding it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography the key here is to recognize that at its heart this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of iraq but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the particularly bush has handled iraq onto that criticism polk is one of those authors that rightly and mostly accurately points out all of the bad things the has done when it comes to iraq from a moral or humanitarian perspective of course it 's wrong to give support to someone like hussein i think most people would agree with that what baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the had done even though it was not the reason given the had accumulated quite a large moral debt to iraq in short we owed it to iraqis to get rid of saddam further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in feldman 's what we owe iraq '' and cushman 's a matter of principle '' my last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about intentions and mistakes and believe me these are all warranted polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help iraqis build a better future and more importantly he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if hussein was still in power today i think it 's important and necessary to call the on its mistakes but at the end of the day the actually helped get rid of a dictator this time and even though we owe this to a lot of other countries i can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case and that for all the other problems there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in iraq that chance certainly did not exist under hussein the biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand iraq but this book i believe is doing more harm than good if you 've done a fair amount of reading on iraq this will be clear so that 's not the danger here what would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of iraq after reading it these are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because i have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it while not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as michael moore or sean hannity it is much more disappointing because polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work framed in those terms this book is largely a failure
deadline follows the fictitious journey of is project manager webster tompkins illustrating the lessons he learns along the way i bought this book primarily due to the great reviews it garnered on after all you ca n't go wrong when a book rates 4.5 out of 5 stars from over 25 readers can you yep this book was terrible because of two very big problems the book did n't say very much in pages and what it did say i do n't agree with it also tends to contradict much of tom peter 's 'in search of excellence ' or to state it another way the book points out about five very useful of information but takes forever to do so those lessons could have been summarized in about five pages with compelling examples
while i greatly enjoyed demarco 's books peopleware '' and slack '' i felt this attempt at a novel was weak spoiler warning tompkins the main character has supposedly been chosen for his role in this novel because he is an gifted experienced manager yet pretty much every chapter is a lesson he learns by screwing up perhaps i would have found it more palatable if the character was a manager who knew he was ignorant in the end comes the revelation that in spite of all the mistakes he is an excellent manager because he about people i do n't see how this shows among the management problems he faces is reporting to a difficult supervisor up the chain and the solution to this problem is essentially to have the man poisoned and sent to the hospital ! can you say cognitive dissonance
i agree with the premises of this book but found it rather boring and not the easiest to read if you want to read something similar that does n't read like a textbook i would suggest losing faith in faith '' atheist universe '' or like rolling uphill ''
this is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early in post cultural revolution china the 5 people live relatively miserable lives touched by official corruption and incompetence with the exception of one who benefits handsomely china is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality with widespread corruption and widespread incompetence this view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years this book is an interesting read as gossip often can be but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day china
this book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless it tries to be all things to all cameras and therefore says nothing specific about anything add to this the way it tries to tout kodak film and you realize kodak should be paying people to read this book but they still would n't know how to work their cameras
i purchased the digital version of this book for which i totally regret first the book is bloated and really offers little more than can be viewed free on nist 's website second the adobe drm digital rights manager reader wo n't let you make a backup copy and amazon their indian customer service '' reps anyway do n't understand either fair use copyright laws or customer service thus not only would n't i buy this book i wo n't ever buy another product from amazon ever again to update i although i can not change my opinion of the book 's content amazon did satisfactorily address my inability to make a backup copy of this
not since portrait of the artist as a young man '' have i labored so much to get through a book i finally quit at page 35 unable to go on a complete stream of consciousness mess best describes this book why this publication came so highly acclaimed i will never know do yourself a favor you feel inclined to give it a read go to your local library the paper and ink has already been wasted do n't waste your money too a better title would be the tao of poop ''
i picked up this book because it seemed so charming the author took the stories and characters of milne and juxtaposed them with the taoist teachings of people such as lao tzu pooh as western taoist starts off interestingly enough but halfway through it i came to the realization that it was making me want to just read the actual milne who was frankly probably a genius writer those were great books with great characters each with their own type of intelligence then about two thirds through the book it just becomes insulting the author is against pretty much anything useful rather than believing in the give and take of ying and yang or any other name it may go under he 's against intellectuals who are secretly foolish for trying to figure anything about the world against people who work hard and care about their jobs or contributions again that 's just foolish people who enjoy sports or exercise heck he 's against leaving your house or caring about the rest of the world i understand the idea behind the busy backson rant but is there no middle ground at all the idea of the indian american culture being superior to that of the almighty puritans is used as an example which could be built upon in several interesting ways but instead the author chooses to illustrate how everything that came after was just silliness without supplying a single idea about how it could be done better yet useful at one point he actually uses the example of paraphrasing here turning on the news to hear thousand people were killed today when five jumbo airliners collided over downtown lose angeles '' stop worrying about everything and go about life listen to the birds chirp they will tell you more about the world '' we should n't care about thirty thousand humans being killed in a horrific accident i am in no way an expert on taoism but unless everyone who is finds that idea posing as a representation of their philosophy to be offensive i want nothing to do with it it is n't enlightened to go around hating everything while doing nothing and i 'm sure the author realizes this since he spends so much time writing books
i 've been through this book a few times now i admit that pooh seems a good taoist if i remember my theology classes right i will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator 's tone hoff 's contrasts between taoist and approaches to life invariably give the air of one so often finds in western converts to eastern religion it is this pall of smug apologies to trey parker and matt stone that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn i 'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation were it not for the tone
farb 's basic premise is that american indians have ascended to the heights of culture read white culture by 400 years of systematic genocide that 's what the book boils down to farb also makes numerous factual errors he says the mandan indians are exitinct umm no farb they 're not
this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that 's all she wrote folks there 's no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
this is the sixth book in the left behind series it is also the first one in the series i did not finish in one sitting it did not flow as well as the others so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening the book also spends a lot of time what we read in previous books i felt this time like i read half a novel the book starts in the month into the tribulation but most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book allowing their own desires to guide their actions whether that desire be derived from rage revenge self pity or even guilt rayford spends most of his time focusing on hattie or his desire to kill the though i do like the description of the handgun that rayford procures and when the time comes for the assassination there are a few characters to chose from the book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the stay tuned for the next volume i have read this far so i will finish the series though most people my find this book suspensful i did not
after the first 11 books that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense the books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note i can however find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to fail you with their nobleness '' or lack of guts ! that you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you 're struggling through your live i think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other almost a live force driven by love that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations !
hello people wake up how many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy ! this book was horrid ! boring boring boring after the book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one ! ! ! ! ! after 12 books its still not over my grandchildren will be reading book if he continues like this ! and between me and you what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit i dont plan to even bother to read the book i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book the end '' if there was a 0 star i would give it ! !
what a disjointed mess talk about cashing in on fame all he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book i could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper i was not that enamored with liar 's poker and this book has done it for me with this author it was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good
this is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness lewis ' early literary attempts although lewis is a witty scrutinizing insightful and overall entertaining writer i think this book is highly overpriced most of the topics in this book cover culture issues that date back during the late eighties so there 's also a bit of historical perspective to it when lbos were a la mode donald trump was making headlines and japan was considered a threat to the us economy and welfare crazy thought go for liar 's poker if you want to read michael lewis that script is a jewel
though i am not a vogue reader i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w 's splashes in the tabloids were all about while the subject is only mildly interesting to me the author 's prose reads like a page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who a major or minor gripe with her it 's a heavy and boring read gossip if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining should remain light and diverting in this book it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it i was very happy to put it down perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job but then again when that time comes anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest
mars and venus together forever is one of the most ridiculous stupid books that i have ever had the gross misfortune to read i probably should have expected what i got considering that mars and venus on a date left me cold but i read this one anyway because the original mars and venus book had some interesting insights and i 'm a sucker for a cheap book anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by john gray must be barmy he exaggerates overemphasises and blusters his way through the pages probably with the best motives in his mind but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid according to him men and women are still ruled by ' traditions which dictate that women are all types who only desire to stay at home chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse a beer in one hand and the tv remote in the other i do n't see how anyone man or woman could read this book without being annoyed for women the book is terribly unempowering if you do n't fit in with any of gray 's ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine i do n't want to read a book which tells me that when i am at work i am moving towards my masculine side because being competitive and efficient are male traits it 's all phooey ! for men the book is also offensive john gray says that men should n't express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him no i do n't believe that men and women are the same in all respects there are gender differences but in mars and venus these are distorted overall this book is not worth your time underneath the waffle there may be some good points but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes joann
interesting book unfortunately it really plays on stereotypes it does have a few valuable things to say though
this book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help or are yourself an addict there is no exploration into what treatments will work or not work and some of what he says does n't really seem to make sense in a situation overall it 's useless unless you are curious about what might theoretically cause addictive behavior
i had to read this book for my college course most of the people in the class did not like it or agree with many of nakkan 's viewpoints i personally think he is repeating na to us in his own words if you are not into na yo will not like this book nakkan states abstinence is the only way to recovery i beg to differ with him there are many successful treatment modalities that do not include total abstinence such as methadone and methadone maintenance also naltraxone for those that are in disagreement with mmt how about antabuse that is medicinal he also thinks that is not real recovery '' then because it is medication assisted recovery did not like this book or his opinions
not a profound book lots of to make a few good points a fast and fun read
as a lecturer of i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted
the author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard happenings his intent seems to be to say the internet changes becomes a social leveller youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things but also new processes new paradigms and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so he uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by sec another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast yet another writing programs to napsterize everything he indicates flattening '' of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations and has this concept of insiders '' being unseated by outsiders '' due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined developed and brought to market thanks to the internet there is some truth to his observations but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend it is of course true that the internet gives access '' and freedom '' renewed relevance i like to think of it as digital democratization '' of society
this book contains photographs of some of the women i admire most unfortunately the women are posed holding a large sword as a prop to indicate their fearlessness i suppose that this was the feature that sold '' the book idea but i would much prefer portraits of my heroines without the sword the sword is a symbol of much more than fearlessness and detracts from the book it makes the book corny my husband bought it for me for mother 's day last year i 'd guess from an amazon recommendation but it was a most disappointing gift one that i would never leave out for others to view this would n't be true if the swords were n't in every photo
if we follow ledeen off the machiavellian cliff what is left of the dream of the founding fathers for us to defend this book illustrates one thing that is very important in times of stress normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship xenophobia or even megalomania rule their thoughts ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the usa and he says it without the slightest trace of irony unfortunately for ledeen he negates his own title for if we follow his prescription those who hate our freedoms '' have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms unfortunately for all of us ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the bush administration laws constitution and even geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means history says otherwise ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world historians if there are any left will tell us whether he was right shooshi
it is imbecilic people like michael ledeen who contribute to the current foreign policy which separates the good '' countries and the terrorists '' it is common knowledge that the has a habit of supporting dictatorships terrorist movements groups throughout its history yet the and people like ledeen have the gall to declare a battle of good vs evil '' simply the will support a regime whether it sponsors terrorism or not if it so suits their interests you have the central asian republics for example central american in the saddam taliban in the 's israel now the list goes on and on so this war '' against the terror masters '' is a way the gov't can fool the american people into bloated military expansionism imperialism and a militant unilateralism that will ultimately cause its own demise and sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the will not win for among other things peak oil the decline of the dollar will bring down the economy and hence complex very soon in fact the process has already begun with the iraq war the is no exception to the rises and falls of empires of the past and in fact the collapse will be proportional to its size
i strongly encourage the thoughtful reader to consider this book alongside any of the these people are attempting to destroy our country '' books produced by the far christian right for they are of exactly the same genre and are born of the same unsympathetic fear of the other the authors apparently have no interest in understanding the lives and motivations of those whom they condemn instead we find sweeping descriptions of the destructive intent and power of fundamentalists '' in which the most extreme criminal acts are held up as representative and on to which are tacked an apparent afterthought disclaimers that maybe this does n't describe all christians the resemblance to similar books decrying the insidious plots of secular humanists '' is really quite uncanny this is not to say that the book does n't contain some useful data and interesting opinions but the wheat is so buried in a chaff of wild generalizations unfounded conclusions and outright factual errors all couched in prose that often rivals the worst undergraduate essay that the reader is left not knowing what to trust and what to discard this book will meet the needs of those who already believe that all conservative christians are conspirators in a plot to overthrow democracy it will not unduly challenge your preconceptions however it contributes little to the genuine conversation and understanding that will be required to bridge the divide that such demonizing rhetoric has planted between people of good will on both ends of the political spectrum if you 're looking for a book that honestly represents the fundamentalist perspective let this pass
i found this book to be based more on emotion than fact the facts that were used were blown way out of proportion and context while it is always healthy to look at both sides of the coin politics included this book would never give a fair representation of the fundamentalist side because it is so focused on presenting the conservative view from a gestapo perspective
i have a studying the christian right and this is the worst book on fundamentalism and the christian right that i have ever seen what is not outright lies are straw men '' arguments meant to make anyone who believes in christianity look like an idiot i feel bad for the people who gave it a good review they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the christian right they are feeding propoganda for their own side i was given a free copy of this book and after reading it i threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library it is that bad be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it especially on a controversial topics like this one
i was surprised to see that my grandmother who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give was completely villified by this book because she is a christian i dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book
what a bunch of hypocrits this is a radical hate book if you are a hollywierdo alcoholic drug addict socialist communist then you will love this book in other words this book is for anyone who loves their sin and does n't want god in their life understandable why would anyone who chooses to destroy their own life want to hear someone preach against it according to this book anyone who believes in god jesus religion faith decency and clean living is a fundamentalist '' which group do you belong to whoops does that makes me a fundamentalist well i 'm not being a conservative chrisitian is not necessarily being a fundamentalist this is nothing but a hate book which is typical of the new american left that has taken over the democratic party
do n't bother characters are lifeless plot is boring ca n't believe her first book is a best seller maybe it was just pure luck
if this is supposed to be a satire then the author forgot the key element wit this waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through here 's a little advice for the author take cents out of your coin purse drop it into the nearest pay phone dial the number of whoever told you that you 'd make a decent author and inform them that they have made baby jesus weep
what a pile of vapid tripe reading this book actually lowered my iq i quess i could 've felt stupider i could 've actually paid for this book if the overexcessive use of the terms darling '' amazing '' and delicious '' do n't give you the then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters ' faces anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that paris hilton is a great musician
i read bergdorf blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you 'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly humorous dose of the lifestyle of a manhattan socialite i certainly ca n't say the same for debutante divorcee the story is far less engaging the observations of manners dress and other details of society life are shallow and do n't add much to the storytelling worse the characters evolve from boring to saccharine and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes methinks ps could do better
despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book there is nothing new in this title clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line it is also worth noting that at least one of the great '' organizations in the book fannie may has imploded in an accounting scandal not the worst fad management book ever written but that is n't saying much
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of you n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel pick up the elegant naval institute press edition in a modern complete updated translation with commentary by the leading american verne expert today walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by margot president najvs
oh boy i wish i did n't have to finish every book it is just a pet peeve of mine however i could n't get into this book i see no clear theme i know everyone was horrified at however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse what happens to all the characters one is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on starbucks another one goes back to her husband one runs into a tree while skiing and dies frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad jeez i was really hoping to like this book but i just am relieved it is over
i am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous but this was disappointing it had a promising start but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess save your money i wish that i could recover the six hours of my life that i wasted on this novel
i bought this book because i 've read and enjoyed wendy wasserstein 's plays and i knew it was her last work frankly i wish she had n't written it like many other reviewers i was reminded of books like hollywood wives in the first half parodies of lifestyles of the like most chick lit have about exhausted themselves without more it 's like been there done that the second half of the book if anything was worse either someone else finished it for her or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place i skimmed the last few chapters satire is the dark side of humor it should be witty and this book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work
full of painfully obvious cliches i was insulted on so many levels i do n't know where to yourself the pain run do n't walk
typical obvious placement and recently all too common italian american as disgusting classless filthy producer makes this book a real disapointment so boring to make the italian the new interchangeable bad white guy tired and boring
first off there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and do n't like to know anything before you read it like me then do n't read on ! what was this i love wendy wasserstein as a playwright i could n't wait to read this book ! i thought that it would be a witty satire on new york 's finest '' not the firefighters the upper east siders after i was sorely mistaken the first few chapters are delightful and engaging but soon you long for the book to go somewhere 307 pages later you shut the book realizing that it never did ! the political agenda being pushed was nauseating i daresay it bordered on propaganda ! i liked not one character in this entire not one at the beginning i thought that this was so that ms wasserstein would make a point later she never did you can tell wendy was an excellent playwright from the vivid descriptions of scene it was written very visually i hate to say it but this book 's critical acclaim comes only from ms wasserstein 's previous success as a playwright and her untimely death had she lived she would have discovered that she most certainly was n't a novelist and should have spent her time writing what she is truly genious plays
this book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger imperial powers said condemns intellectuals in the west who in his eyes are agents of exploitation '' yet said himself is an agent of racism a pan arabist he always supported arab unity and islam '' at the expense of and peoples said directs and manipulates the western taste for self criticim and all that does is deflect the world 's attention from arab and moslem attrocities committed against christians kurds jews israelis coptic christians sudanese etc thus reading said you would never realize that sadam hussein 's poisoning of the kurds has never been condemned by one arab intellectual or leader this is because a racist prevalent attitude in the arab mind is that the entire middle east should be arab this also explains the attitude towards israel a country that is predominantly and speaks a middle eastern language other than arabic the pity is that said himself is a christian yet he never spoke on behalf of coptic christians in egypt or the right of christians to practice their faith in saudi arabia and probably other places in the arab world he is facilitating the overall aim of panarab nationalists by distracting the west from what is happening in the arab world for a better understanding of relations between the west and islam i recommend books by bernard lewis such as the moslem discovery of europe '' and the jews of islam '' i also recommend books by the egyptian scholar and jewish refugee yael bat yeor such as the dhimmi ''
denying the suffering of christians under moslem rule is what said wants the west to do the denial of christian suffering by christians who lived among moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked as christians who live in egypt neither said nor i could marry a moslem woman unless we convert to islam as christians neither said nor i would be allowed entrance to some arab cities as christians neither said nor i would be allowed to build a church without permission from the president of egypt why is said quiet about that
when i stared reading danielle steele 's novels well over 20 years ago they were amazing the characters were larger than life the dialog spot on and the plots original and well thought out i 'm sorry to say that i was drawn to this novel because of its slick cover and interesting premise after reading coming out '' i had the feeling the author was as bored writing it as i was reading it in no way could this book have been written by the same author who wrote the ring ''
i almost was n't going to read this book the description did n't appeal to me at all but as we all are danielle steel fans i knew i had to try thinking oh well she has to get better ! '' wrong what a dumb book dumb story while i did n't hate this as much as impossible who can forget the wacky artist this book was just a waste of time to read and come on how much more could go wrong before the ball i did enjoy her though and i wish you read more about her past but the story was exactly just fluff '' who cares about such things anyway how i 'd love to read a story of someone who actually struggles in this life ! although we all read to escape our own lives perhaps and sometimes books about exciting lives can take our minds off our own troubles for a bit danielle steel 's books take us nowhere and we just end up frustrated how can she not read all these reviews from her unhappy fans and try to change her ways ah for the days of thurston house the ring wanderlust days are long gone i 'm afraid but yet we keep reading and are bonded by our constant disappointment
i also have been a great fan of ds over the many years she 's been writing books however i 'm convinced that she ca n't possibly be writing these books any longer they 're terrible and each time a new one comes out i think i 'll give it one more try then i complain about the book and vow never again '' well this time is the last this book was the worst as she 's been doing lately the stories are shallow she repeats herself over and over again her sentence structure is awful her grammer is terrible and did i say she repeats herself over and over and over the story this time was about a coming out '' event for her twin daughters most of the story line was extremely predictible and very trite very boring and as i said terrible sentences and thoughts i could write a book better than this one and i 'm not an author ok i have said it all in past reviews and i wo n't digress but this time i vow and will keep this vow no more danielle steel until she goes back to writing as she did in thurston house '' and message from nam '' until that time i 've given up on her entirely finally
over the years i read numerous books by danielle steel and this definitly tops the list as the worst book yet plot is incredibly
i have been reading danielle steel since her first book was published and this is by far her worst one yet over the past few years her writing has deterioriated rapidly it 's almost as if she does n't care anymore she knows readers will buy her books no matter how poorly they 're written the storyline for coming out is a dual one a woman 's twin teenaged daughters ' invitations to a coming out '' ball somewhat like a debutante presentation and her son 's coming out '' by announcing he is gay at the coming out '' ball along the way one of the twins refuses to attend the ball the other one loves the idea her five year old son by her and current husband comes down with chicken pox one of the twin daughters ' long white gloves for the ball are damaged and her falls and breaks her ankle her husband is jewish her is a holocaust survivor her is a gambler and alcoholic his wife is a bimbo and her oldest son is gay i think she covered all the politically correct '' demographics even so the characters are shallow one dimensional and boring the writing is simplistic repetitive and amatuerish steel used to write fascinating wonderful to read books such as a perfect stranger the ring message from nam wings but not lately
oh please this book is just ridiculous and trite here we have olympia the perfect '' modern woman beautiful a successful high powered lawyer who has the perfect job gets to take every friday off even do n't we all a perfect and wealthy husband who loves her dearly but of course two gorgeous twin daughters one a rebel '' interested in protesting everything the other a social butterfly would you expect anything else a mother in law from heaven an auschwitz survivor to bring a little pathos into the story who she loves better than her own dead mother what other kind of mother in law could she be and a young perfect son naturally oh did i leave anyone out let 's see she has her requisite who naturally is an alcoholic and a complete jerk hmm nothing new there with his silly new wife well did you expect her to be anything else her one black friend yes keeping the story real '' and oh yes the real point of the coming out '' not her beautiful twin daughter 's coming out ball but her eldest son admitting to her that he is gay at the ball of course while she gazes up at him proudly with tears in her eyes let 's bring the storyline right into today 's headlines the book was so filled with cliches it was pathetic from the husband taking a stand against going to the ball because it was against everything he believes in while he is naturally fighting for the poor and downtrodden in his high powered legal job to the husband playing the ponies '' and living on his trust fund has not worked in 15 years to one of the twins getting a tattoo which just almost destroys olympia because the tattoo will show when the twin wears her dress to the ball oh but handy survivor grandma to the rescue who manages to sew a perfect stole by hand in one afternoon after olympia dashes around and naturally is able to find the material in the exact shade weight and hue as the dress of course this coming out ball is supposed to be for wasp '' society only so the husband makes a stand by refusing to come to the ball olympia decides to make her own stand by inviting her black friend and her husband as well as her auschwitz survivor mother in law to the ball in the days before the ball the youngest son gets chicken pox the mother in law falls down and breaks her ankle one of the twins boyfriends breaks up with her one of the twins loses a glove chewed up by a friend 's dog and olivia has to run out to buy a pair of manolo blahnik heels for her daughter oh yes and the twin 's escort shows up to the ball with electric blue hair but because olympia is perfect she manages to fix '' everything at the last minute did you expect anything less this book was just awful and did not ring true at all each character was a cliche in themselves way over the top the premise of the story was ridiculous i have read most of danielle steele 's work ok so she is not dostoyevsky but her books were good for sitting down on a long afternoon with a nice cup of tea and reading a juicy and interesting story this short book seemed like it was almost written because she had contractual obligations to fulfill there was no passion the sentences were short and stilted and she seemed totally disinterested in her characters come on danielle steele you can and have done a lot better than this ! ! ! do n't bother with this book when i finished reading it i literally groaned it was that bad
i just read this book quite quickly in one afternoon i think i 've pretty much purchased and read every danielle steel book she 's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads i understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory there is never much suprise as to how a ds book will end the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns historical and geographical research she puts into her books this book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books definately not worth the hardcover price time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity this book was fluffy dull
i wonder if danielle steel is running out of material as her recent books have been rather superficial and not very engaging compared to her classic and deeper earlier novels although quite glamorous the idea of a posh coming out '' party is n't very interesting or applicable to an average person living in the contemporary world as short as this novel was there was so much repetition and rehashing of the storyline and that space could have been better filled an author of danielle steel 's calibre should have fleshed out the deeper issues contained in the plot instead of glossing over them at a fast pace
how bad can she get i loved so many of her books this one was bad dont bother her older '' echoes is the best book of hers i loved it
the others in the series were great and i really looked forward to a breath of snow and ashes it read like it was all gabaldon 's discarded notes for the previous installment i felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book
i'am unable to get this message to anyone this is the second book i orderd and both books are bad this one starting on disc 4 all is bad i sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me i had the same problem on vanishing point the cd left will not play on my player i will not order another book from you once i can see this happen but twice is unacceptable
i had been meaning to read this biography of alan shepard and i happened to pick it up in a cruise ship library as i read it i was surprised at the number of factual inaccuracies there is at least one glaring error per chapter which calls into question almost everything else between the covers numerous reviews here mention more problems with technical aspects of the book that i was unaware of but which do not surprise me given the apparent lack of proofreading and an example upon finding the book i leafed through it and found the section on apollo 14. there it mentioned that john glenn had almost killed himself when he lost control of the pace car at the daytona 500 and slammed into a flatbed trailer crowded with journalists '' this sentence boggled my mind for it contained two errors the pace car was at the indianapolis 500 and john glenn was a passenger while a local dodge dealership owner was the driver the book is just full of examples of this kind of sloppy reporting edit i see that at least the paperback edition correctly says indianapolis 500 but it still incorrectly implies that glenn was driving the pace car
i had to read this book for school i thought i would love it but it turns out i was wrong this book was mind numbing it is drawn out and boring i almost threw the book away and rented the movie i should have this books sucks do n't waste your time reading it
mr silber must indeed be very good at he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book when i set out to pick a book on i wanted useful insights something a little deeper than smile and the world smiles with you '' or at least a clear method a set of carefully selected and tested steps after reading so many reviews praising this book i thought i had finally found what i was looking for big mistake this book is not clear or organized or particularly insightful it 's just a big long jumble of ideas loosely grouped into chapters that all seem to talk about everything and nothing it is not very well written in terms of either formal grammar or style and is only mildly amusing as the lack of a clear direction quickly makes it boring but that 's not all the book is filled with quotes and facts '' that may be appropriate for a casual conversation among friends over a beer at a bar but definitely not for a book that the reader would like to be able to rely on in other words it reads a lot more like the national enquirer than the washington post in my opinion the author makes the mistake of confusing creative people with ignorant unsophisticated people lacking a critical sense
'ajax and php ' is a very mediocre book with a lot of code in it not especially good for learning and not worth the price if you want a really good ajax book i recommend 'ajax in action'
this book is the biggest piece of literary trash i have seen in a long time it is a collection of propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life the agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author the poems are rather sophomoric at best and are poorly written most of them make no sense you would have to be inside walker 's head to comprehend her contorted style it appears that walker should in a college level poetry class this book is trash do n't waste your money on this piece of junk i took my copy back after 24 hours
found recipes dated layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the is useful its generally from another era bought gourmet cook book instead
if you want bad gourmet recipes then this is your book the basic information is poor at best and the fancy '' gourmet recipes are not even good when i begin to cook a meal i 'll look in the joy of cooking '' get disappointed and go and find what i want on the internet the recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early century this book should have stayed there i 'm sure your grandma loves it though ! squid in ink sauce ! for real c'mon
the two new sciences '' are required study at thomas aquinas college in california i and a number of students have this paperback edition the pages come loose and just keep coming loose as you study the propositions even being very careful with the book the pages still keep coming out i have heard a number of other people complain of this same problem pretty much everyone here knows that the paperback edition falls apart and they only buy it since it is cheaper than the hardback i have no idea how the pages hold up on the hardback edition but i hear that it is better than with the paperback so unless you intend to put it in a display case and read it from there i urge you to skip the paperback version and get the hardback or get another publishing entirely if such exists until wall emerson gets their act together and republishes this book fixing the problem i rate two stars only because of the greatness of the text itself subtracting three for the horrible binding
i bought this book at a yard sale just out of curiosity it 's been a good long time since i 've had an opportunity to read some marxist propaganda doggone it the soviet union crashed and all the fun stopped the propaganda wars of the were a hoot for while between vladimir posner and the drowning cpusa we got a glimpse of a kinder gentler marxism this book reads like something out of people 's daily world i gave the book two stars for nostalgia value i read the book in one sitting and was n't surprised at the conclusions it drew that it is all the fault of the nasty capitalists who want only to enslave the beleaguered working class they bombard us with advertising and like mindless dolts we go out and get ourselves in debt and become slaves to the system ultimately the book is condescending and juvenilizing shame on you authors ! treat your readers as intellectual equals ! typical of hardcore marxists you treat your fellow working people as not very bright needing your divine guidance it 's always strikes me funny how none of these people plan on working in the pencil factory after the revolution there are two approaches one can take when confronted with the reality that workplaces have become increasingly toxic i agree with that assessment we can look to the nasty old government to change its ways or we can look to ourselves to create a living on our own independent of corporations i choose the second freedom is always the best option i recommend claire wolfe 's how to kill the job culture before it kills you '' it addresses these issues in a clever and intelligent manner and proposes reasonable solutions to wage slavery ''
with all the publicity this book got i thought i would learn something i did n't know very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning very disappointed
this book is very disappointing as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear ie bin laden and aq are everywhere responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups such as ji are aq franchises total bollocks the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a scholar '' who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
if you wish to destroy your database or knowledge on buy this book the title is a warning in itself no academic with high profile has ever managed to infiltrate inside ' or correctly speaking the muslim brotherhood it is barely possible to insert any deep cover agents at all let alone an academic who is fluent in none of their languages and is obviously not even a muslim hanging off of the of policemen is easy enough but they will not reveal much to an academic who employs sensational revelations to make a living gunaratna claims to have been the principle investigator at the un terrorism prevention branch tpb this is a straightforward lie no investigator positions exist there or have ever existed he was only a temporary consultant and he was not a un staff member the un tpb is not an or organisation in any law enforcement sense but an organisation which employs historians and lawyers to work on international and national legislation against terrorism laws no agents mr gunaratna claims 20 years of policy operational and academic experience in counter terrorism in his biography at http gunaratna there is nothing to suggest that he ever been involved in the proactive field operations form of engaged in by some intelligence security police and elite army organisations that said bear in mind that a cleaner at langley can truthfully say i work at the cia '' mr gunaratna has a remarkable but unenviable reputation in law enforcement and intelligence circles but is going to betray their oath of office or official secrets act to refute or confirm what gunaratna asserts so in the kingdom of the blind the public domain information on alqa'ida the man is king except that he has not the one eye he claims to trust this is to invite principle investigator and i am napoleon bonaparte
this book is appalling it is disempowering to women providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births with no reference to back it up and generally gives a do n't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you '' attitude even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby in spite of what this book says there are things you can do to minimize tearing and episiotomies do n't heal better than tears in spite of what the book says things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions and so on of course there are times these things are needed but not nearly so often as the book suggests and it 's not nearly so random it continually cites opinions as facts without any evidence base there are much much better books out there than this one do n't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book
i know that no book can cover every topic but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness which is much more common and some of the information was just plain wrong i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the week because i could n't feel the baby move it advised that i should call the doctor when i did i found out most women do n't feel it move until 21 weeks unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong i would not suggest this book to anyone
i have this book and it is weak as hell it does n't give you anything common sense ca n't figure out for you it does n't explain anything in great detail enough to help you out at all do n't waste your money try trial error shabam the moderately sober fat mac
big disappointment i expected this book to be hysterical her sense of humor is certainly different ! very shallow material marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
a few good things but she 's lost her edge and i find it impossible to identify at all with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there botoxed massaged plus i 've never made per year so i feel like i live in another cosmos besides i live in france where real faces are appreciated constance rodrigu
dicker seems to believe that peppering his text with foul language gives his work an edge i ca n't decide if he is just trying to be hip urbane or if his vocabulary is so limited he has no other option if dicker considers himself a serious writer and apparently he does he should concentrate on holding the readers ' attention through solid writing and give up the crass language i would not recommend this book for anyone expecting a thoughtful carefully crafted critique of
oh yes this is a very fine book for me to poop on ! in other words it 's a joke book it 's just another one of a half dozen duds out there all trying to slam whoever happens to be the 1 retailer at the time this decade it 's foreign countries paying their workers less blame ! worker insurance prices going sky high because the medical industry it 's fees blame ! crooked unions feeling threatened they 'll get their butts kicked by competition blame ! etc you just have to laugh at how these schlockmeisters try so desperately to compare themselves to a real activist like micheal moore who actually accomplishes some social good once in awhile but you know who 's really laughing that 's right that 's because they 've already built their thousands of stores and been in business for over 40 years so it 's way too late now for these media wannabes to do anything about it ! and what do these ersatz authors expect at this very late date anyway that millions of consumers during these economic times will be instantly brainwashed by these new crackpot books and then suddenly start to boycott lower prices '' ha ! ha ! ha ! like i said this has got to be just another joke book
this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money page 364 principles of long term investing chapter 8 shows that among the s p 500 index returns large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks '' now look at chapter 8 of the 10 largest corporations only 2 exxon mobile and citigroup are value stocks '' duuhhh now i know what to do i have a choice of two stocks if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart if you know little it wo n't add to your knowledge at all
i find it much more difficult to navigate this book than say moreland and fleisher 's book of latin grammar furthermore it 's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate the author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion
i saw a documentary on hank '' bukowski and thought i 'd give him a day in court this was the only work of his available at the library so this is what i sampled it 's crap a waste of time bukowski 's reputation certainly ca n't rest on this alone did he pull an esoteric and write this just for the initiated maybe the book still sucks
this was bukowski 's last published work before he died it 's an detective novel or a parody of one and an allegory about a man getting ready to die it 's clever at best there are some great at worst it 's convoluted and easy taken in context of bukowski 's life it 's a big middle finger to all the literary elitism bukowski despised but as a book it 's little more than its title suggests pulp fluff and if you 're not interested in bukowski 's life this book has little to offer
hands down this is bukowski 's single worst book bought it when it first came out just his death in 1994. having read just about everything the man had written pulp '' was a hugely disappointing epitaph if you 've never read bukowski start with post office '' or the short story collections but avoid this like the plague a bad book i ca n't think of a single reason to recommend it
now do n't get me wrong i 'm a huge bukowski fan post office is a great novel and women is pretty damn good also but this is just awful if this was his first ever novel it would never have been published bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then i can believe why pulp is just a very bad book the story is stupid the plot is a mess the characters are dumb the only good thing about it is it 's short it 's a shame to read something so bad from someone i used to love to read stay well away from this book you will only be very disappointed
calvin hobbes is far and away the best comic strip ever and i looked forward to getting this set for quite some time if it were n't for the problems described below i 'd give this set 5 stars but i have several issues with the production quality 1 the removable '' goop they stick the top label on under the shrink wrap stuck to the covering on the and left a spot that wo n't come off 2 the books fit very tight in the case and when i pulled the first one out the covering of the case was caught on the corner of the book and pulled loose there was no way to get it out without that happening it also came loose in other places this is unacceptable as it caused permanent damage 3 the corner of the was crumpled even though it was packaged very tightly this was the fault of the shipper as it had clearly been dropped but one of the books had damaged pages corners slightly dented and folded over this could n't be blamed on the shipper as it was inside the shrink wrap i think i will be sending this set back to be exchanged or refunded
very disappointed in this book i think one could get more from a google of la oh well i guess i expected unusual stuff given the title
i was horribly disappointed in this book i look forward to debbie macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically not this time chrissie was a pain in the neck and the way susannah handled her relationship with her daughter allowing her to whine and blackmail her almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle her mother 's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and i would have liked to have read a little more believable solution there is hope however susannah is buying a flower shop on blossom street in seattle could it be that she and lydia hoffman the shop on blossom street and a good yarn will meet and appear together in a future publication if so i hope it 's better than susannah 's garden
never having read macomber before i picked up susannah with interest hoping to discover the secret of her popularity while the premise of this book is a promising one it never reached it 's potential susannah as a character is oh so nice and for a woman in her 50 's remarkably impetuous and her husband joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing and daughter chrissy evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent comes across as petulant and spoiled as so often happens with writers who turn out book after book macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases he wound his arm around her waist '' less than halfway through this story its central mystery '' became transparently predictable and in the final 30 pages all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places on the positive side macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of alzheimer 's perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written
this book was easy enough to read it just was n't what i expected from quindlen i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out the from current day to the past was somewhat confusing and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past whereas the previous paragraph was present time although i got used to that writing style i always found it annoying the storyline itself never sold me either a typical young '' boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the perfect '' father i just did not find such an occurrence likely and as a mother myself all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm anyway the whole story seemed and disjointed to me and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many many years
i have n't actually read the book but the title says it all the author does n't understand economics ! wealth is made by the ingenuity of the people who seek to produce better goods and services that would satisfy consumer demand ingenuity is sadly lacking in china now or ever look at any chinese invention and see its real development only when the europeans got hold of it from razor blades to paper money not convinced look at patent production in china it is eclipsed by most us states or european nations sorry no sale
i 'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence this work however is pure tripe critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this it 's akin to the random scribblings of a old or a canvas the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play in my mind it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense beckett sure accomplished his goal look how many reviewers commented on the extremely difficult themes '' and brilliant artistry '' of the play
the information presented in this book is amazing the economics of baseball are hardly talked about there are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us do n't know about it was fascinating to find out about this but it got to be too much for me to handle i ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why i gave it two stars i also disagree with some of zimbalist 's theories on how to reform baseball he is not open to any other ways and i should know since i met him once for a seminar
very average book ! frei does n't go down as one of my favorite sports writers loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story
by the other reviews here you 'd think this was a marvelous book fullof interesting endearing characters performing in extraordinary times in fact the book reads like a story from a friendly uncle who carries on and on about people you do n't know who he has n't made you care about there 's little to bond you to the characters and much of the book explains the not particularly interesting season of a wisconsin football team in the preface the autor relates how his father 's life inspired the book and this feels like something someone would write for the benefit of the narrow group of people who experienced it not the general public
this was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said it was boring
this book had a good message and could have had a lasting impact on me but the plot was obscenely dull and the middle of the book gene and finny relationship does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book not recommended
like many other readers and amazon reviewers this book was assigned reading for me in high school i read it again recently when the kids got it and found it has not improved with age one wonders why generation after generation of teachers continues to tout this book as a classic '' when it 's really far from enjoyable the premise is interesting youths coming of age during the world war era that 's changing not only their future but their entire way of life unfortunately the characters from prestigious wealthy families who are more than just a little bit snotty just ca n't hold the average reader 's sympathy teens could n't relate to them 30 years ago and ca n't now the main character furthermore ca n't be referred to as a hero since he deliberately wounds his best friend and is indirectly responsible for his death did he do it on purpose '' wo n't hold interest for hundreds of pages and the fact remains that whatever the reason he did do it either through deliberate cruelty or carelessness neither reason is excusable if we want kids to love reading give them something that 's interesting and characters to like a separate peace '' provides neither
i generally like david sedaris in fact he 's one of my favorites but when his stories veer off into the death of children almost gratuitously i ca n't see the humor this is please note the first book of his that i have n't enjoyed but it 's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me
perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug are n't i hilarious '' tone of this book note it is entirely possible that i am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book or even to identify the humor in the book the story of the two families competing with each other to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar and donating various organs was the train wreck of the holiday tales although it may have been the story about the preacher i ca n't say for sure because i gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely so in fact perhaps the story is not about a preacher i 'll never know neither should you i think it 's fair to say that the condescending narrator of these tales simply could n't bring himself to care about his characters they 're simply dimensionless cliched props the suburban woman the socially competitive neighbors that should immediately journey to oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which sedaris has seen fit to deprive them speaking of hearts and brains this book could use a hefty dose of those too
finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty ! yunnus has proven by the success of his bank 's loans to the desperately poor that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support founder of the grameen bank he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world including the us and canada have shown that lending to the poor helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried yunnus ' book is inspiring and an it made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations can not bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help it 's hard to separate the book from the idea one is as fascinating as the other out of 5 points i give it a six
this book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than i am but while i was reading i kept asking myself when 's he going to get to the point '' the first part of the book is all about why it 's good to be rich something i thought was unnecessary the bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to and poor finally in the last part of the book he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy this was the only part of the book i was interested in to me it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a book on investing and so kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with fluff '' however even his advice is considered questionable by many experts i would say that the main idea i got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd i just wish i had n't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise
this has to be my least favorite of my kiyosaki collection i will sum it up for you think and know the power of leverage passive income is taxed at a lower rate than earned income and you got ta buy assets ! there you can continue shopping
words can not describe how ripped off and disappointed i feel about buying this book having read rdpd and cfq in the kiyosaki range previously and finding them great i thought this book would be great as well i 'm sorry to say it 's the worst book i 've ever read the entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books there 's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more you need to buy one of his other books i did n't get any useful information and it 's certainly not a 'how to ' book i thought i would be reading about him and his wife 's story but all i got was the same few points said over and over again he does n't even try to say them in a different way the other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option it was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members i could seriously go on and on about why you should n't waste your money on this book but i wo n't i have never written a book review on amazon before as i have never felt so strongly about a book i generally feel if i get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it in this case i did n't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why i decided to post this review i hope it saves someone else from wasting their money buying this book will not help you retire young or retire rich
this would have been a good skit or maybe a short story but not an entire novel the book is tired like the town wigfield
i love david sedaris i like strangers with candy but this is the worst book i 've ever read all of the characters are exactly the same and the entire book is a repetition of one joke save yourself valuable time and money and stay far far away from wigfield
funny people have it bad when they 're actually making you laugh they 're fine when they 're failing to make you laugh they come off as desperate flailing nerds i was a huge fan of stranger with candy whose writing was incisive and brutally funny less so with the book of liz and even less so with this book sedaris colbert dinello are funny people but this is an embarassment it 's abundantly clear now that they require a format ripe for a to shine was there a draft or was this a for their agents every joke in this dud is a throwaway a tiresome type of joke starts on page 1. by page 2 you 've detected the formula and by page 3 it 's just grating the plot is the flimsiest possible structure three smart asses can bounce bad puns jokes off of it quickly collapses i could not complete it but i suspect the book ends up being lightweight crap when you commit to nothing but your own funniness you never get around to questions of merit this is a desperately nerdy book just as the posed funny '' pictures suggest i 've never seen less funny pictures who was the intended audience for this the dumbest person i know has a more sophisticated funny bone than this there 's wit and then there 's corn this is a whole crop of the latter leave time for your own groaning if you plan to read the whole thing
really i hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves you 'd think it 'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot you 'd think that but you 'd be wrong instead you 'd be left saying jon stewart my man you liked this seriously are you high no wait do n't answer that it 's all becoming abundantly clear to me now ''
i 've read only a few of hillerman 's previous novels i 've enjoyed what i 've rtead though they are an acquired taste and i do n't indulge in them very often i tend to enjoy the earlier more active years of joe leaphorn more interesting than his ' unofficial advisor to jim chee ' phase from what i gather 'skeleton man ' continues a recent trend of disappointment with hillerman 's last few novels even without having read the books immediately prior to this one i can understand that sentiment 'skeleton man ' starts off with a rather risky premise tying the story in with the real life collision over the grand canyon in 1956. while an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life ' see nelson de mille 's 'night fall ' hillerman fails here the story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters flimsy motivation and very little that could really be called 'action ' chee ends up joining leaphorn in the background for much of the story the spiritual and ritualistic aspects of hillerman 's earlier books are for the most part glossed over here even what should have been a major plot development chee 's wedding is overshadowed by chee have to rescue manuelito in the manner of far too many contrived 'superman rescues lois ' situations better to stick with hillerman 's earlier novels the 'aging athlete past his prime ' analogy suits hillerman i 'm afraid
after reading so many positive reviews i decided to try skeleton man as my first hillerman novel unfortunately i 'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it i read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before but i find hillerman 's writing style to be very choppy and awkward i find i have to sentences to catch the meaning because it just does n't flow smoothly here 's an example of one paragraph that i opened to randomly '' getting this ceremonial procession from tuve 's village on second mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited by the time tuve had brought them to the hopi shrine at the tribe 's salt deposits joanna craig had looked at her watch three times that chee had noticed navajo fashion he had n't glanced at his own tuve would finish when he finished '' it 's like he talks in short cuts that you 're expected to follow when i 'm reading this book my mind is wandering all over the place because the text does n't draw me in i 'm glad he has a lot of fans out there but i 'm not one of them
a poory written racially charged work by a bitter probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a key '' to historical development in addition to the cycle of history thesis he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle spengler points to a nation 's will '' and race as the key to a kultur 's '' success this is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to national socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction facts be damned interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis
god this book was awful ! not just the story it was the construction that turned me off the storyline is weak and the writing immature characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier there is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events i can go on but i guess i need to be more concrete a sprite introduced within the first 45 pages suddenly develops ventriloquistic abilities for just one scene nary a mention before or later of that ability while it is the prerogative of the author a little more finesse would have been nice there is an unnecessary page or two of pontification before each of the five parts that comprise the book for a work so shallow in its content this essentially has a '' aura guenhwyvar is totally in the book there was some evocation of majesty associated with the panther in the first book in this third book he had all the majesty of a tomcat also unbelievable is a battle towards the end where the panther is unable to dispose of the pet dog of the bad guy then there 's montolio what can i say a couple of chapters i thought this might be a promising character especially with the blind archer bit he even defeats the great drizzt in battle seemingly teaching him a valuable '' lesson then dies a few months later of old age c'mon ! ! with this book i give up on robert salvatore never mind the ringing endorsement given to him by margaret weis in the 'introduction ' strike one for her
sojourn is the conclusion of the dark elf trilogy which began with homeland continued in exile and ends here if you 've not read the first two books then i suggest you do so now because the third book is a direct continuation of the other books and you 'll be missing out quite a lot by starting here exile was a notch below homeland it suffered from poor characters and a very predictable storyline and sojourn is n't much different none of the characters from the first two books remain besides drizzt of course so the reader has to deal with a whole new cast for the most part these new characters are very one dimensional and similar to the characters in exile in that there 's no attachment to the characters they 're just stage props that drizzt interacts with before moving on to yet another part of his journey characters leave or die out of the blue and they 're not very fleshed out the only decent character montolio receives almost no development besides a page or two about his past the author could have spent more time on the characters instead of writing overly long 10 page battles that go nowhere the action returns here in quantity as in the books before again it feels that more of the book is spent in fights than anything else and the battles themselves are completely too long and are littered with many unnecessary descriptions the writing too is the worst yet there are many sentences that just do n't read well at all and show a very amateur style the book itself is very simplisticly written so it will appeal to the younger crowd but if you 're looking for some deep well written fantasy then look elsewhere the poor writing weak and boring characters and overly long battles are the main downfalls of the book the world still remains rather interesting with interesting creatures and a lush although not fully developed world the story is rather weak too as it just continues on the course exile took the story is uninspired and nothing much really happens throughout drizzt just moves from one place to another with a few small stops and adventures it 's probably the worst part of the dark elf trilogy although the ending does introduce some new characters that may bode well for the icewind dale trilogy
what 's wrong with all you amamzon reviewers i actually quite liked shutter island but this was total garbage the morose tone is totally overdone throughout and the end is pathetic the interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story avoid
when i bought the book i did not know that they already made a movie out of it but i learned about it later on so i was really excited when i started to read it also because other comments were really good unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all first the story development is really it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens second several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly the worst part of the book though is its style it does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime gets an extensive characterization most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter but even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter could n't it still be an interesting book unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well the detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages on top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially conclusion if you are a psychologist like character studies this is exactly the right book for you but for those of you who like stories ample twist and turns surprises action thrilling developments elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time please do not come anyway near it watch the movie instead this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours
i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is we 're supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an shortstop in high school the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character
rollins ' book is an unfortunate combination of the generic and the pretentious there 's nothing wrong with a generic thriller as other reviews have pointed out but if the author wishes to float a seemingly serious argument about evolution v intelligent design it would behoove him to provide a moderately sturdy frame the material from quantum physics does hark back to jurassic park while the nazi involvement moves us into the neighborhood of the boys from brazil or the assassini even the surprise ending evident from about 200 pages away is lifted straight from the genesis code by john case but those conspiracy theory classics well case 's is n't a classic but it 's a good read are anchored by characters and minimal dependency on the crutch of coincidence rollins ' characters are all of the usual suspects and less there is the generic complement of intrepid males most with two last names greyson pierce monk kokkalis logan gregory painter crow and the mandatory hottie this one named dr lisa cummings the waif role is filled by an orphaned pakistani teenager with the unlikely name of fiona raised in london she lived for several years on the streets after her parents died and left her to an abusive uncle she subsequently bummed across europe still trapped in the of her early teens and ended up living as the adopted granddaughter of a copenhagen book dealer somewhere along this odyssey she managed to acquire fluent dutch as well as staggering skills the latter slightly less improbable than the former dr marsha fairfield and dr paula kane are two terrific exceptions to this collection of figures in a genre affording little space to the middle aged female unless she 's a type of rosa klebb rollins gives us two accomplished and daring women lesbians no less sadly they get a minimal amount of ink still two stars for effort a devotee of the sentence fragment school of suspense writing rollins could use some serious editing phrases and clauses are to be expected but what 's left should at minimum follow the conventional rules of grammar and usage the air tasted old moldering as much as the shop 's paper stock it was like much of europe age and ancientness were a part of everyday life here '' p 50 moldering air ancientness pile as much clothing between you and the rock to limit heat loss from conduction '' p 106 as much as possible other unedited gems include people walking after they have taken a seat entering a room for the first time twice and speaking after they have been said to exit as for the plot itself there is the obligatory scene of obsessive nazis fleeing europe with material precious to the once and future reich to today by page 80 the reader has witnessed simultaneous death and casual destruction in copenhagen in zululand south africa and at an isolated monastery in nepal when i say simultaneous that is no exaggeration by means of a at the top of each section rollins asks us to accept that the occur with perfect synchronicity ok we 've already suspended disbelief for yet another nazi conspiracy theory so why balk at this if the cliffs were hung less frequently i would n't object but this book can be described as a series of encounters lightly salted with narrative and boring digressions while rollins seems to fancy himself something of a philosopher here the attempt to include intelligent design into a mass of molecular biology is pretentious he does n't trust his own story enough to rely on the tension generated by his ideas he has to keep loaded guns monsters explosives fire and all manner of imminent demise in the faces of his characters who begin to resemble as they pop up relatively unscathed ten pages later the idea of darwin 's family bible holding genetic secrets is very intriguing but it goes up in smoke after failing to live up to its imaginative promise if all you want is to hop from one moment to another this is the book for you if you want a conspiracy theory try michael crichton 's state of fear or michael cordy 's the miracle gene aka the messiah code
do n't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there this book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases i guess it lives up to its subtitle of life as a forensic anthropologist '' in that she usually presents only her part in each case with little presentation of the entire case the forensic cases are not really the star of this book the author is i was frustrated with the lack of depth instead read the body farm '' by bill bass excellent storytelling there ! he gives you personal stories but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated
i found this book quite tedious since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work there is almost no information on forensic anthropology her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them rather than what the actual details were from the cover and the blurbs i expected actual case histories the book does n't deliver the book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally
i read this book with my bookclub it sounded witty and fun it was not it was very boring and a big let down most of the stories went like this we found a dead body this is what we did then we went home my bookclub has been meeting many years this book was voted the worst book we have read as a group i would give it no stars if i could do n't waste your money
this book would 've been a find '' if i were in my early teens but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile this book is just too lightweight yes it is about books and literature but the coverage is extremely shallow i would consider this to be something like the reader 's digest condensed books form of benet 's reader 's encyclopedia buy that work instead of you 're looking for a good reference work on literature
funny how people always vote a review to be not helpful '' when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter does n't like if you are a mickey d 's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage or if you are a you 'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine but if you 're here to really see what someone who has n't been hopefully this review will help you this book tells an accurate tale of the solely means by which mcdonald 's has grown into the fast food empire it is today sure it 's a capitalistic wet dream but what this book does n't cover is how 's exloits workers vales corporate profits over franchise success and feeds people mcgarbage that ca n't even be called food all without being honest about its products or practices i 'm sure devoted mceaters and mccapitalists will trounce my rating review but that really just proves my point read this book but if you care to know the whole story be sure to also read something presenting another view such as fast food nation
i was n't too into this one i 'm a big fan of steinbeck 's fiction but this memoir is rather dull i was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of america at the time he wrote it but as an older man as he even admits he is n't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths the ones that he does write about come across as a bit uninspired nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he does n't have too much to say the one highlight was the last couple of chapters when he goes to the south new orleans and witnesses all the slimy seperatists as they scream and holler with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools he is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking as much as a mediocre work as it was i did take an interest in it because i am a fan of steinbeck it was cool to hear him write a memoir other steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them i recommend it just on that basis as long as you take into account the stuff i said above if you have n't read steinbeck please start with the grapes of wrath '' or tortilla flat '' those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this
what a terrible story was unable to finish it stuart woods was at one time a very good author but when he started with holly and stone he in effect quit writing this is about a militant band of right wingers robbing banks and oh by the way just had to kill holly 's intended just an hour before the wedding which did n't seem to break holly up all that much as she still has her best friend her dog and her father which she has conversations with regarding three somes and their sex lives in general signet books and stuart woods should both be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market
after an impressive debut in orchid beach we meet holly barker on her wedding day day that is destined to become a fateful day instead of a happy one woods paints a picture of a heroine who seems more interesting in solving the bank robbery than mourning the loss of the man she supposedly wanted to spend the rest of her life with in a painfully dreadful narrative woods presents us with another variation on the extremist group of fanatics who want to make the us better by getting rid of anyone who is n't white been done so many times before that it 's redundant in this tepid story woods does n't offer us anything new and the pacing is so slow it becomes sleep inducing woods also makes the mistake of having ham holly 's tough father carry the weight of the book while ham 's an okay guy he comes across as a dirk pitt or superman in this one and it just did n't work for me the ending is also pretty lame and even the inclusion of stone barrington makes little narrative sense a real disappointment is the third any better
i found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend 's house i asked my friend if she 'd read it and she said not yet but it 's a patterson so it must be good '' words were never spoken this is the first patterson novel i have read i am glad that i borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself i suggest that if you insist on reading this than you would be wise to do the same let me just say that i do n't enjoy giving bad reviews but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels i have ever read i feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment i experienced maybe because it was '' by this gross person but it just seems that this book was written too quickly with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought i kept reading hoping that the story would get better but it siimply did not when one of the characters was in mortal danger i found myself thinking who cares '' this boring read has an utterly predicitable woven throughout and again it seems pointless and cheesy one reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel the plot twists are predictable and uninteresting and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat the sentence structure is so elementary that i was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade english student i am by no means a book snob '' but i can not believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating it is just beyond me if you are looking at the writing alone it is terrible not to mention the unbelievable events that take place main character boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just can not believe any of the events could possibly take place i know that a lot of patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because i did n't like this book but i am trying to be as honest as possible maybe some of his earlier works are better well i guess they could n't be a whole lot worse in any case
sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian this book is awful the storyline is weak and predictable the dialogue is excruciatingly lame and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry there is virtually no romance which is the reason to read sparks ' books i ca n't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said the way the dog seems to be human and the predictability of the plot this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it if you want a good plot with romance mixed in read message in a bottle or a walk to remember if you want suspense read mary higgins clark or agatha christie they do a far better job with it than sparks does

kathy may have been doing dog training for years but she is n't staying current with what 's happening in dog training sure she implies that she is using positive training because she 's using food but she 's also telling people how to correctly leash pop their dog even with the food training she 's using 'okay ' as a release word which means that anytime that your dog hears this word in a conversation around it it is ok for it to break from whatever behavior it was currently doing if you want a new jersey dog trainer check out pamela dennison and her great books the complete idiot 's guide to positive dog training how to right a dog gone wrong bringing light to shadow a dog trainer 's diary i would also highly recommend pat miller 's positive perspectives love your dog train your dog or the power of positive dog training
this is a collection of often old studies that the author has collected i learned about the harlow monkey experiments in college 30 yaers ago his earth shattering conclusions include that we should strike a middle way between spirituality and materialism and that often after people have bought something that they always wanted they are dissappointed at the climax of the book he states that in order to be happy we need loving meaningful relationships and a job that provides us with satisfaction what a shocka ! ! ! ! how we establish such relationships and find such jobs is our problem in short a collection of simplistic drivel however i give it 2 stars instead of one because it flows along nicely
maybe i 'm being shortshighted but i feel as if the many concessions i already have to make with this disease are hard enough to incorporate into my daily life without also including such intense dietary changes i work including travel and client entertainment making it very difficult to always control every morsel i consume also do n't share the author 's background and early diagnosis symptoms mine are coming more slowly and i am entrusting my treatment and care to my rheumy sort of wish i had spent the money on a good yoga or meditation tape instead
first the good points this book is quite and an excellent overview of many competing therapies '' for autistic children both myself and my sister have worked extensively with autistic children and we have family members who suffer from both autism and asperger 's syndrome but this book is extremely biased and sadly not altogether true the lovaas method is praised as recovering '' children from autism and though maurice repeatedly states that her children are recovered '' from the evidence she herself provides it 's fairly clear her children were not autistic '' to begin with it seems that while her daughter may have had some form of developmental disorder she was obviously not autistic and the idea that her daughter recovered '' in a matter of mere months is ludicrous even sillier is the story of her youngest son who does not seem to have developed any indications of autism beyond being a late talker it seems as if maurice found doctors who told her what she wanted to hear and then became obssesed with recovering '' her children clearly her daughter benefitted from the early intervention but maurice 's story lacks credibility for those who have children with true autism maurice 's story of a miracle cure '' will prove more devastating than encouraging a particularly tragic story of a woman named lucille '' is appended to the book who upended her family 's life to enroll her autistic son in a program partly on maurice 's advice and whose son has so far made little progress there are autistic children who do become very even mainstreamed but deficits remain that maurice 's children recovered '' so fully and rapidly is proof that they were never autistic to begin with at her interview with her child 's behavioral therapist she states decisively is going to recover '' of course since she 'd already decided in her mind that her daughter was autistic it was easy enough to then declare her recovered '' a few months later maurice seems not to understand that autism is a spectrum '' disorder and she accepts as faith that it is a completely neurological disorder much like depression autism can have either biological or psychological causes and the root cause is not always so clear at one point she notes failed bonding is a result of autism not the cause '' but again this is n't always true even more biased is her presentation of the various alternative therapies for autism she rejects all medication therapy various nutritional approaches such as those for food allergies and vitamin b are briefly raised and then dismissed her extreme prejudice towards holding therapy belies her own statement that she believe it to have some real '' if limited '' worth she paints martha welch as a dangerous flake a gross libel welch may well have been a bit for her tastes but i have seen children benefit enormously from it even more dishonestly she viciously pans virginia axline 's seminal play therapy '' which has stood the test of time and which again i have personally seen the benefits of it is true that behavioral therapy has an excellent track record in terms of helping children become but no one therapy is a magic bullet '' in my experience children benefit from an integrated program which includes behavioral speech play and nutritional therapy and very often also medication though the author does not explain her animosity toward it lastly though i am not indicting the author for being rich she blithely ignores the fact that the average parents not working on a wall street not a nonworking wife who has a nanny anyway not living in a fancy manhattan prewar etc can not afford to have this type of intensive treatment brought into their homes and must instead become advocates for their children within the local school system maurice does supply some valuable information on the appeals process with schools and hmos but if you are the parent of an autistic child think again before reading this book it will likely hurt your feelings and what good information it provides is readily available elsewhere
this book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with asd i have a big question to the author where are her children now show the evidence they truely recovered
i thought this book was all over the place but maybe that was because i only read it before i went to bed there were flashbacks and flash forwards and i thought the author was trying to be overly clever none of the characters were really that interesting to me it was sad that jean did n't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one wow ! i hope i do n't end up like that when i am her age how could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things what a miserable life ! i am glad this book was short or i would have put it down sooner i am not sure if i would read any of her other books i do like the fact that it is set in north carolina which takes me back home i thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me it is probably because i could n't relate to the characters because i just do n't live my life in total isolation others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters
i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good better a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret '' is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles his editor chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 40 or even 50 pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera '' speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
as time goes by i have less and less respect for anything milton friedman has to say we should all remember that enron is the desired republican result of friedman 's structured finance '' what others would call organized and other scams and we should all remember that the freedom to choose among consumer goods is not something the founders considered important enough to enshrine in the bill of rights it is also important to note as does barry schwartz in his the paradox of choice '' that constantly being asked to make choices even about the simplest things forces us to 'invest time energy and no small amount of and dread ' there comes a point he contends at which choice becomes debilitating rather than liberating did i make the right choice can i ever make the right choice '' we normally assume in america that more options easy fit '' or relaxed fit '' will make us happier but schwartz shows the opposite is true arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological many of friedman 's suggestions for reform '' are gop platform that serve the hidden agenda of gutting america 's national security interests this is especially true of his school voucher '' program that will deprive america the nation of millions of intelligent citizens of the republic who are qualified to vote based on an understanding of national issues that goes beyond the superficial jingoism doled out at voucher schools '' which are in reality nothing more than the segregation academies of the massive resisters so as globalization transnational corporatism subsumes democracy it becomes clear that friedman is more of an apologist for profiteers and criminals than a major economic thinker
i 've read a lot of the books in the series and hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers but i have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries my main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author his mysteries almost always hold water but not this one i recommend most of hillerman 's other jim leaphorn novels but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill this is not the book to pick up
i think i would have liked this book if i had read it when i was 14 or 15. sweet dreamy simplistic but i am much older and i was struck by the inconsistencies the young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves ' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later i lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel in 1938 then there was the secretive silent and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked i was disappointed in this book
do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish there is factual information here but it is buried in gushy i bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause but i 'd be embarrassed to lend it out
the wisdom of menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman 's body during and after ovarian failure menopause this book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause ovarian failure while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace i do n't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer
i was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by christiane northrup in this jumble of a book at a time when i needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body i turned to christian northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause a wonderful combination if northrup had chosen to focus on menopause instead she is all over the map taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life if i wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers husbands and daughters i could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life instead i sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life if you are a middle aged woman who has stuffed your feelings '' all your life and need help speaking up for your youself this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice but if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured this book will shock you with its pettiness i am quite new age and believe in all the stuff mentioned in this book but when i turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue that 's what i expect i can only hope that northrup will this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication i was embarrassed for her and returned it i just do n't buy it in more ways then one
some of the medical information is very helpful my recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35 it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy nor is it for someone who has young children at home her hormonal theory that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age do i think that my total hysterectomy at 34 and the obvious onset of menopause changed my ability or desire to nurture my children of course not that 's ridiculous and if i think about it too much it 's actually offensive her comments about marriage are questionable as well marriages sustain many changes and menopause is just one of them open lines of communication deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the hormonal storm '' how sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage should n't we be doing that every day and ourselves to growing together many reviewers have commented on some of her more methods i am not a fan of tarot cards and i 'm not sure how i feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions by using them that 's just my own opinion i tried to look beyond that i just think this is another book written for people older than i am that 's okay but it still leaves me looking for something i can truly relate to
in his magnum opus 1984 george orwell famously wrote who controls the past controls the future and who controls the present controls the past '' this is a lesson that jared diamond has obviously learned well in his latest book collapse '' jared diamond '' continues to push the europhobic liberal agenda hiding behind the facade of environmentalism diamond crafts a that calls for europeans to embrace the values of failed cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global european cultural hegemony unfortunately for diamond genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination diamond makes the assertion that easter island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation this may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for mr diamond it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations radiocarbon dating of soil samples by carl lipo and terry hunt indicate that easter island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that diamond 's theory would require quite simply the new evidence uncovered by lipo and hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of easter island was far too short for diamond 's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation to quote carl lipo '' it fits our century view of us as ecological monsters there 's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically but we 're passing that on to the past which may not have been actually the case to stick our plight on to them is unfair '' it is difficult to just how badly compromised diamond is by this evidence the easter island chapter is a major plank in his argument the fact that diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure those who may think that diamond 's easter island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of diamond 's version of the history of greenland the extinction of greenland 's viking colony is used by diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism diamond claims that the vikings perished because a racist contempt for the inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation a cultural superiority complex caused the viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and in diamonds words the greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish '' this is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism the major flaw in diamond 's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony 's extinction the greenland vikings had in point of fact switched from a diet that was 80 farm food to a diet that was 80 marine food in otherwords the viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives to present the vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians the vikings are well known unless you are diamond to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource the alternative explanation for the vikings demise is that the age that caused the vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of alaskan inuit who competed with the vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide we know about the mini from the evidence of core samples and tree rings we know about the innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record in the face of genuine science and history i 'm afraid mr diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history
while reading this book i found the details of some cases to be unbelievable also the photographs '' of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings i 've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim 's hair or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore and who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent doberman pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence sure just let that dog on in and whose place of employment has a record of all employee 's blood groups '' not their types just their groups when the employee does n't even know himself what group he is then i read the introduction which i always skip and found out this book is fiction not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store as fiction it 's okay i prefer agatha christie but i do n't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact so read it for entertainment but do n't be so gullible as to believe any of it
i read another book by this author friendship cake which i really enjoyed and passed around to several friends so i picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read luckily it only took me about an hour and a half to read it since that 's about as long as i 'll remember it i guess i never really cared about the characters too much it 's not a thick enough book that there 's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters which is too bad because they could be interesting and i know hinton 's capable of it from her last book i also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story i never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing the story happens to characters who happen to be interracial but i never get that it 's important to the plot not to mention that the big secret '' is telegraphed so blatantly it 's hard not to know what it is almost immediately in spite of its faults i think it would be ok for a quick beach read or if you just do n't care for much depth at the moment
this book really fell flat lynne hinton 's first book friendship cake what such a good read i was sincerely disappointed in her second work she had a good beginning but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant and a little dull there was some hope of a good plot but something was definitly missing try again lynne you have talent maybe try a sequel to friendship cake the characters that you developed in that book are really good
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the in a row preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and ugh and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom ' mentality in the end i think if a person is from a household respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too even ones personality and this book does n't send a message about love as much as 'i own you ' i like 'mama do you love me ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love moon ' by margaret wise brown however is by far my children 's all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly 'normal ' family take it grain of salt
dr laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment it is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs if you dont believe in god and as dr laura you can never be happy is the moral of her story laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare modern child abandonment she talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up ' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical she moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons ' or a year before being married actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage ' is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready she would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice her rants and raves are actually entertaining too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets i listened to the whole thing audio book cd and i couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title i guess they are there and maybe under chapters in the book i could call out several stupid things but i didnt see 10 that stood out lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious it is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source there are other better sources for relationship info
self proclamation does not a doctor make dr laura 's credential 's are not within the field of who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness has been estranged from her own family for years she who points the finger also had the finger pointed at her posing nude living with a man without the benefit of marriage having an affair becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage have all been written about laura schlessinger and made public noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite unless of course they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent
i was skeptical when i saw the length of the book at just over 50 pages and with good cause if you are going to present an argument for a depression in the works you should at least present detail of all of the main issues and present sufficient data to back up your claims merely using demographics as the main argument is not only insufficient but irresponsible something as major as a depression is very complex and is only triggered from the right sequence of economic financial and social consequences falling into place finally this book is outdated and does not address the effects of free trade the healthcare crisis social security underfunded pensions and many other issues although its under 10 you would be better off spending more and getting a whole lot more rather than something that should be more appropriately submited as a high school essay
although i agree with arnold 's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful it should be apparent now that the increase in the djia which the author asserted must happen '' has not materialized where has all the money gone another new bubble has been this time in real estate i suggest digging your financial foxhole now
this book '' if you can call it that is a waste of money it would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it instead i would recommend harry dent 's book the next great bubble boom '' both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn but the dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it
you can waste your time reading this book sure go ahead or you can pick up henry hazlitt 's the failure of the new economics an analysis of the keynesian fallacies '' and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys keynes and his faulty logic not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable keynes he shows the reader multiple instances where keynes simply contradicts himself yet keeps right on chuggin ' savings investments somehow in his general theory keynes manages to both prove and disprove this he explains in lucid terms that keynes general theory '' is n't general '' at all in fact it can only be applied correctly in static situations in most cases it ca n't account at all for dynamics do n't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage
keynes was no doubt an influential economist his theories and 'expertise ' on economics influenced the deal economic policies of the united states and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like imf however his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the particularly in the with the stagflation an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to keynesism we have keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government read planning for freedom or socialism by ludwig von mises instead
flowery verbose rambling compound sentence upon compound sentence this book was unreadable for me i quit
ben franklin is my hero i have 12 biographies on him this was the worst i first started collecting franklin biographies forty years ago van doren fay issacson brands wood and a half a dozen others at first glance and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different a new take that concentrated on france well it was new and very different it put me to sleep in my chair several times i eventually gave up and shelved it with the others what a shame boring
i 'm giving up on this book it reads like a first draft sentences like the following on page 71 abound when you hear not so often as you wish remember our silence means our safety '' the committee of secret correspondence now doing business as the committee for foreign affairs although franklin who had never mastered the original name was not to know for months soothed the envoys whom they understood to be starved for news schiff needed a good editor but did n't get one this certainly is n't pulitzer grade material i wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the anniversary of franklin 's birth van doren in his biography gives a better account of franklin 's years in paris
contrary to popular opinion on this website i found this book to be boring repetitive and badly written it was so boring i struggled to finish it during a journey where i had little else to do this book summarizes a few events that were significant to intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled being an engineer and not a manager i found this to be vague and rambling however i do agree with the book 's title only the paranoid survive i think this outlook is useful for everyone and not just business types
i picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it the whole book is about strategic reflection point '' i was disappointed that andy grove did n't try to explain srp in a more concrete manner after finishing the book i still have very vague abstract knowledge on srp nevertheless andy grove is still one of the best ceos i admired
this book could have been one chapter but i guess that 's hard to sell ! i have no idea why this has such a high rating it 's repetitive internally inconsistent and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving if you want a hopelessly book about a ceo patting himself on the back go for it tons of boring anecdotes ! got ta fill up the pages somehow !
andy grove helped to build intel into the behemoth it has become on the other hand he did n't sell ibm on the which was the critical moment nor resolve all the manufacturing processes they had in different fabs craig b 's watch did that this is a relatively short book and could be a lot shorter inflection points yeah i get it now please move on andy if you are a sales or marketing executive and read books like this and are awed by them you are the probably not the sharpest tool in the drawer
one of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use which is to say it all depends i note for example in the introductory chaper page 1 overgeneralization '' there are a couple major overgeneralizations that 's why they needed to invent math and science where nothing is real except precise definitions and logic works wonderfully using reason with actual real things takes more than logic
i was disappointed in this book especially after reading the other stellar reviews which are all weirdly from texas where the author lives when it 's a book about logic and clear thinking a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors imprecise logic and muddled thinking needless to say i almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors exampe from page 11 because the real is out there we must effectively with it '' here 's another gem from the same page i am sorry to have to tell you that fact but that is the way things are that is the nature of nature that is the reality of reality '' look at page 33. the author states why when one exception is uncovered multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality '' very disappointing has n't this author studied any cognitive psychology it 's called confirmation bias and it 's entirely clear one more example ! on page 60 the author states that barbara boxer a senator from california does n't know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol '' and is unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun '' ouch how does he know what barbara boxer knows or does n't know she 's actually very on the difference between the two has he heard her speak on the subject it comes across as more of an ad hominem attack than anything anyway save your money on this book and instead buy jamie whyte 's crimes against logic now that 's a book !
i 'm a big fan of hooper 's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series however a fbi agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what i was expecting from a kay hooper book it was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided and i found the satan cult slant boring i think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books
this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is there is n't a single clue at any point in time the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you do n't even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine since she ca n't even remember much about herself much less him if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard
this book has several problems which keep me from recommending it to anyone it book presents most if not all dragons as wise and helpful to humans it is we humans especially christians who make dragons into evil monsters many of the facts '' about dragons presented are if not outright wrong i have to wonder how wise this is if you are planning to go summoning otherworldly entities in ritual for example fafnir is supposeldey the ruler of dragons of the south '' roughly analogous to the guardian of the watchtowers of the south there is also a description of fafnir 's mythology which describes how fafnir is slain by the germanic hero sigurd fafnir while dying warns sigurd that sigurd 's treacherous friend '' regin is about to kill him however any other book of germanic or european mythology will tell you a more complete version of the story fafnir and regin were human brothers who killed their father for his hoard of treasure among it the cursed ring andvarinaut fafnir then took all of the treasure for himself changing himself into a dragon to protect his twice stolen hoard not exactly the sugar 'n ' spice version of dragons presented in this book and somthing to seriously consider before you invite him to be invoved with your rituals come to think of it many of the dragons '' presented here are not many are simply large serpents or other mythical beings labelled as dragons the illustration of the goddess tiamat '' clearly has a and is called in mesopotamian mythology books an imdugud or if what you want to do is have draconic wicca if you feel a deep and true connection to dragons and dragon imagery this is fine more power to you as someone with friends who are dragon people i get this however i would encourage you to read actual mythology concerning them captured maidens stolen hoards patricide and all look at the original myths and the cultures that knew of these beings and do n't take medieval accounts at literal face value these are the same people who believed that bloodletting cured disease after all i 'm sure your rituals will be much more powerful for it i will say that this book would be useful for its tables and wiccan imagery just do n't take it too seriously
take basic baby wicca add dragon images stir it all together like paint or a bad mocha end of book dungeons dragons literally has a better draconic cosmology any skilled practitioner of an established occult system could cast better spells with a d d book and their discipline avoid this book unless you simply wish to add to your established collection of all books that include dragons '' the second star is because it does have some cute pictures and details that could be added to a fantasy roleplaying game
terrible absolutely terrible ! dancing with dragons '' is more like a dungeons dragons manuel with magickal references to the king arthur move excalibur '' all you need to do is add some cultural references info on elements and various eclectic wicca rituals and voila you have a fluffy book with little substance and relation to occult studies or magical workings oh my goodness i think i will write a poofty wicca book ! i think i could absolutely do it ! seriously though students and seekers and those experienced in magickal systems paganisim wicca or what ever my advice is run away just run away unless of course you desire a good chuckle
if i had the option to i would permanently ban conway from ever writing another book she gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics from basic wicca to ceremonial magick to history and mythology and the list goes on and on if this book were shelved under fiction it would be better but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot with no historical references cited in short buy the book for a chuckle serious practitioners of the craft and the art should look elsewhere for instruction
as others have indicated this book features the reunion between the four young mages previously seen in the circle of magic '' and the circle opens '' books it deals with how the four friends have grown apart and sandry 's required trip to visit her cousin the empress of namorn unfortunately i just did n't buy it the fights seemed contrived their conflicts were n't very realistic and i just did n't enjoy reading the book as for the danger plot '' i have to say i thought it was idiotic the sandry of the previous books would not have stinted her duty for any reason her sense of justice was so strong she would have stayed and fought the system not fled it renouncing a heritage because of a single custom was ridiculous frankly it felt as though pierce just wanted to get sandry back to her 's court and came up with this plot contrivance to do so daja 's character and romance were the only things that made this book even remotely bearable i used to be an incredible fan of pierce 's books but they have really been falling off lately i hope she spends a bit more time and thought constructing stronger plots in the future
this is a book about emotional intelligence which does not consider the reader 's emotions it 's very insipid and lacks the depth if you have already read the emotional intelligence by the same author i would n't suggest this book
this dolf de roos book is no different from his other books owning one is the same as owning all writes about same topics and ideas good author trying to sell more books by using different titles if you do n't own any of his books worth the 20 or so for the book however if you do do n't waste your cash flow happy investin
i purchased both this title and the insider 's guide to real estate investing loopholes '' same authors i have two primary complaints the authors talk down to the reader constantly making snarky comments that imply that if one does n't act now the reader is lazy or paralyzed or is somehow inept when it comes to business that 's not just annoying it 's weird and it made me suspicious of the authors ' motives that brings me to my second complaint the book lacks balance i 'm not saying that all of the strategies ca n't work just that it requires an ideal set of market conditions for them to work we need to see low or declining interest rates quickly rising tenant incomes improving neighborhoods distressed or at least disinterested sellers few other investors low insurance costs and a plethora of service providers such as roofers who do great work at a low price very quickly i can tell you that we do n't have any of those factors at work now what we do have at least in areas like mine where appreciation has outpaced incomes is a market turned on its head sellers will not sell because they are sitting on huge profits for the most part and do n't have to sell or they believe that prices will appreciate at the same ridiculous rate that they did from numerous investors have flooded the market and bid prices up beyond all reason workers are in debt and do n't have much money for rent neighborhoods where deals are affordable are n't improving so the idea of refinancing because you painted and put up a new mailbox wo n't help you easy mortgage money has gotten anyone with a pulse into homes interest rates are rising not falling insurance is costly and the coverage stinks and most importantly rents do not provide positive cash flow for most small real estate investors i know several who actually consider themselves to be successful and the news is not good they are carrying their properties their properties are not carrying them ! i know it 's hard to believe that this is success but in the past few years appreciation has bailed them out put that kind of leverage into effect and you are leveraging a negative which only means you go broke faster a few observations first if making untold riches were this simple and this obvious then so many people would attempt to do so that it would suck the potential profit from such deals down until the actual profit is more equivalent to the amount of work involved more about this in a moment because i believe that this is actually occuring in part due to all of the real estate evangelism going on as they say on wall street when enough people find the key to the market someone changes the lock ! '' i believe that most people reading this review are smart enough to know that markets are dynamic outrageous profits bring in a flood of new entrants dramatically reducing the profit potential if a whole bunch of new wannabe real estate tycoons start lining up to bid on properties then the prices for those properties will rise as will the price for the money the financing charges in the form of interest rates even without a lot of new entrants if enough people start using the same financial techniques of leverage analysis or tax strategies then the advantages to be gained will be reduced commensurately common sense and basic economics dictate that costs will rise and potential profits will fall and so it is in the real estate world economies of scale and technological advancements have changed many industries and wiped out others the ability for a small business person to get a competitive bid on anything is severely limited whether you are talking about insurance waste collection land communication services landscaping or anything else big players have the advantage in negotiations and will consistently be able to lower their costs below that a single investor they can offer their tenants more amenities and constantly remodel and update their units at a far lower cost than you or me i ca n't start a profitable shipbuilding company or tv network nor can i jump into owning large buidings over which i can spread my costs enough to justify what is increasingly becoming or negative cash flow from tenants i am not saying that there will never again be opportunities for small real estate investors to use leverage and tax advantages to make decent money just that with so many of your fellow investors looking to do the same thing you are not going to find deep breath here ! underpriced positive properties in undervalued neighborhoods with great potential on which you can quickly close at a dynamite interest rate that result in units with stable tenants who are happy to stick around so you can quickly refinance at massively increased property valuation '' dolf 's expression so you can pay yourself and your investors back raise rents even higher and go on to the next property with similar ideal parameters plunk 10 down and do the same thing and no i 'm not an unmotivated individual who works harder than i have to does n't understand the value of money or does n't want financial freedom we all want that in dolf 's world there are numerous individuals who ca n't wait to to sell you 100 for 50 my question is if he knows how to get people to do that why he is telling us about it i think we all know the answer to this question do n't get me wrong eventually the property marketplace will right itself and investment properties will come up that offer opportunity to even small investors even with the odds stacked against you however it wo n't unlock some kind of magical door to riches it will simply be one of many investments that helps you build wealth real estate is just another business that goes through cycles and is n't necessarily any more of a path to fabulous riches than owning a chain of gas stations or making molded plastic products by the way the most successful real estate investment firms in america have had a total return about 23 annually for the past five years through march 31 2006. that includes dividends and share price appreciation if that 's the best they can do and i 'm not saying it 's bad it 's actually an amazing performance ! it 's because that 's the best anyone can hope to do including you and me remember these firms use all the leverage they can muster and have tremendous economies of scale and the smartest tax accountants and attorneys working on their behalf we are highly unlikely to see this performance repeated in real estate for the next five years or possibly ever footnote i recently studied single family homes in broward county and palm beach county florida over the past years not including taxes of any kind residential properties have enjoyed an average annual return of 9.25 per year performance tends to regress towards the mean therefore we are virtually assured that real estate will come nowhere close to its recent performance over the next several years particularly in a rate environment with lots of new supply buyer beware
i was a little disappointed in this book there is n't much new information that i did n't know already the information presented was n't enough it 's good for people who are getting introduced to real estate
since i loved jurassic park and the andromeda strain way back in high school i happily picked up congo at the airport what an enormous disappointment the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half nonsensical details are never explained what 's with the gray gorillas and the paddles the gorillas were trained by the back in the day to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it this is never made clear the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up and the characters are ridiculously this is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you 're sol the plot is not going to come together and you 're not going to be satisfied that plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology left me entirely cold this book hit the airport trash can the minute i debarked
like jurassic park '' this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters my reasons for such an accusation 1. crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts and while these can be quite interesting they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline dan brown for instance is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity as a result the book comes off as slow and stumbling 2. the plot is n't all that interesting to begin with vengeful gorillas talking gorillas misanthropic gorillas come on 3. the book 's ending is utterly terrible 4. cricton 's writing is weak and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing sorry michael but this book just did n't do it for me
this book has a great title but somewhat lackluster content the book is really not so much about changing the world and more about one organization in particular in addition to focusing on an organization i find that the stories of the people the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they 've found who have made or are making a difference in the world it 's not necessarily are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you it just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often
samantha seems a lot like becky a young woman whose life is very out of balance and does n't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions instead of staying at the firm and working out her mistake '' she runs away this is just like becky hiding her bills and then she gets a totally implausible job because she ca n't tell the truth again like becky samantha does n't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to i agree that the firm would never have taken her back they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care samatha like becky at times seems somewhat manic in that she 's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation just like becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared lithium anyone i do n't have an opinion on the controversy '' but i do think kinsella 's protagonists need to grow up
i picked this off the new nonfiction shelf at the library to see what a writer might have to say about the stage of life i 'm in too as others have said atlas remains i think too wrapped up in the expectations of his privileged class envying classmates who made more money while living in manhattan sending his kids to private schools and maintaining a home in vermont methinks he doth kvetch too much just because you have enough skill to make a living as a writer does n't mean you have anything interesting to say honesty alone is not enough if your story is not compelling atlas does well with biographies but as autobiography other than the chapter about his father this is too and more irritating to me at least simply too mundane he has an opportunity for adventure he mentions going to tibet for example but derides it as trendy jewddhism '' too commonplace '' to consider commonplace ! how about staying home and crabbing about your life that 's commonplace his age does n't stop him from seeking excitement and engaging the world in new ways but he 'd rather stay on his familiar turf and ponder his limitations and even a good writer ca n't make that choice a compelling read like reviewer ts '' i was reminded of woody allen both rarely stray from their manhattan comfort zone which fair enough as a personal choice but any work produced as a result is unlikely to tell us much new we all have these stories many more interesting than his take some risks james learn to scuba dive visit the taj mahal and angkor wat ride a bicycle around mexico move to new zealand seek some passion get outside yourself and your cocoon rage a little bit then write a book !
he gave it all he had but there just was n't much of interest there he 's a turmoiled loser and not very interesting one to boot kafka roth and jeremy leven satan et al write about similar troubled jews and are much funnier and interesting i like his honesty but it 's not worth the price of admission
i gave this book 2 stars because the first 2 fifths of it were rest stunk as more eloquent reviewers have mentioned galbraith refers to himself and his accomplishments almost as much as he takes cheap shots at republican administrations innuendo nitpicking minutiae drip from the pages his rant about the inappropriateness of some administration speech writer without input from the state department oh no ! referring to an axis of evil '' incorrectly because an axis must be a straight line is one example the pages ooze with galbraith 's liberalism and elitist arrogance as he hypocritically spotlights the arrogance of others he writes continuously about himself he acknowledges he feels the overthrow of saddam is justified and then complains about the way it was done all the while acknowledging most people are better off in iraq today he actually has the balls to say that the nuclear developments in korea and iran are somehow the fault of the invasion of iraq in the acknowledgements it becomes clear that galbraith is writing homage to his dad who wrote a little book '' called how to get out of vietnam '' he even admits his lecture series was called how to get out of iraq '' armchair generals and presidents abound in the printed page unless you are looking to reconfirm your own prejudices i recommend you save your money and check it out of the library it will ease the pain of your wasted time
i was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes if you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit i found it to be for me as i was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who think for a living rather than their managers
if you manage in a service industry and are looking for tips on how to evoke higher performance from your knowledge workers keep searching for another book take 5 minutes and read the summary at the end of the chapters you 'll quickly see that there is little practical information or depth here
based on the advertisement at amazon this was the book in search of excellence it was not the book but an interview about the book i was very disapointed i still want the book on cd but feel it futal to try ordering it again on amazon as it is a nusance to order and return if you can help i would love to purchase the actual book on cd thank you steve kiewit 2543 770 623
the book itself is not bad information is good somewhat dated in parts but good the problem is nothing new is in the book all of the information can be found at one of several websites like or etc most of the information is pretty common sense if you have to get the book or do n't want to look on the internet for the information then at least go to the library and check it out and save your money
carter 's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and philosophy is just about on target his prescribed fixes however are little more than just the sort of but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering while carter promises a new approach to integrity in american life all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic we can learn to do right by doing the right thing or listening to the right people '' he seems to say without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms instead he depends on his own completely subjective ideas of right and wrong which do n't convince his appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls media culture '' and other evils '' political hackwork
as a story not a prequel '' this book is relatively fun if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos i ca n't believe this made it past editing ! as far as being a prequel to barrie 's peter pan this book misses the mark there are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower '' of barrie 's richly woven classic these are not the characters we knew and loved this is not the never land we dreamed about at night pixie dust is now nothing more than space dust '' which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact need i say more
i really wanted to like this book i bought it to read with my old because she and i are so interested in pirate stories i am also a fan of dave barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and however like many parents i decided to read some of it alone to make sure that it was appropriate for her age and her sensibility my husband and i are not prudish by any means but we do feel a need to preserve childhood for our kids as much as possible and shelter them from that which they do not know or need to know at such young ages and i am so glad that i read a few chapters before sharing this book with her as it is highly inappropriate for example there is a captain slank in this book that at one point is flirting with a governess named bumbrake it is innocent enough at first he meerly gets excited at seeing a flash of her naked ankle but later peter pan hears the two engaged in the following '' oh mr slank ! '' she was saying you are the devil ! '' that i am mrs bumbrake ! '' boomed slank and you know what they say ! '' what do they say '' they say '' roared slank the devil take the hindmost ! '' then peter heard bumbrake emit a very squeal followed by what sounded like a slap followed by some thumping then more squealing then more thumping and then much laughing from the sound of it peter figured they would n't be breaking up the party any time soon oh my ! i do n't think they were playing checkers ! and i am certainly not going to put myself in a position of having to explain this to a old which is the suggested audience age for this book by the way nor do i think it is appropriate or necessary for a book like this it is published by disney for crying out loud ! so for parents who are in securing a nurturing peaceful unsexualized childhood for your kids stay clear of this book it was only on page 55 that i found this inappropriate scene i imagine there are more
this book is okay it never really immerses you in the world instead you just sort of skim along the top of it about what happens next everyone feels like a stock characters the bad guys '' are bumbling idiots and the good guys even peter are and we barely even see the task force which calls itself the starcatchers and the book really could have survived without them tinkerbell does n't show up till the last page or so i spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast and the croc never eats the clock as an avid dave barry fan i could literally pick out which lines had been written by him not to say that the book was funny because unfortunately it was not his style just flashes off the page in neon colors a few innuendoes will raise eyebrows they really should n't have been in a book so geared toward children there are better books out there buy them instead
my first nora roberts ' book only be persistent did i complete the book it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of roberts
this book will do very little to help you understand the brussels griffon there are only a few pages about griffs the rest is about any kind of dog and griffs are not like other dogs they have many unusual traits save your money and buy a book that is really about griffs the only one i know of is doone raynham's
people of all groups ethnicities religions and races commit cons steal and such to paint a whole ethnic group gypsies romani folk with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites oven tenders '' because of the holocaust or call all corporate officers embezzlers '' because of enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so these sorry characterizations merely illustrate how twisted the slanderer 's own views are while the grain of truth is that some people of all groups might con other people the larger truth is that all groups have their share of criminals and no group has a monopoly on virtue marlock clearly has written a book that is quite racist and wrong in spite of the grain of truth that some few people are indeed criminals marlock tries to cover his tail by saying that he does not mean all '' romani folk but then he goes on to make it quite clear that means virtually all '' but ca n't say so without legal liability issues it 's pure cya and then he goes on and on with his racist slanders yes cons do exist and this book describes many of them no they are not gypsy crimes '' but just crimes and are committed by people of all ethnicities too bad he does n't just stick to describing the crimes and never mind discussing his racial hatreds marlock 's agenda is clear if he only wanted to protect innocents from crimes he would not focus on a single group of people the number of romani people in this world is miniscule compared to the number of criminals in the world so his focus on gypsies illustrates his true agenda here is merely to demonize a tiny group of people the furer 's reichspropagandaleiter minister goebbels would be proud of marlock as one of their own i am sure
well if you ca n't blame anyone else blame the gypsies dennis marlock is doing very well probably using gypsies as his career enhancer however replace gypsies with jews hispanics blacks asians and you would have a libel lawsuit on your hands dennis keep talking about gypsies and you true racism continues to show through
rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 in this they completely vanished or mutated i 'll only be getting the one because it 's the last one and i 've read this far so i might as well go the whole way in books one through four the trio of harry ron and hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving and more whining than day saving book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done this book harry seemed to care more about romance a very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction which had no background or build up from previous books a female character from the background whom harry barely even notices all through the past five books is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in fashion several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to rowlings amature attempts at romance none of which bore any revelance to plot or story harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence the clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another the image of harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with malfoy as to the general plot of the book poorly done continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me most of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information and the culmination of what harry was did n't amount to anything my final opinion do n't bother to read past book 4 if you 're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization a very disappointing book
the paleo diet is based on an interesting the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment it seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time because their decisions are instinctual creates a problem that does n't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans sometimes we do things out of curiosity or laziness or false beliefs so considering the erratic behavior of humans who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild the fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact rather eat more food just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food unless the environment from which it comes is and that is a very real problem meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era the paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world now we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy this is no longer true the average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous you must choose your meat sources carefully meat made from animals raised on in a caring manner can be very hard to find i found loren 's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded and in some cases irresponsible there is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture high fructose corn syrup acids artifical sweeteners uncleaned foods raised with pesticides and herbicides and improperly raised food animals my main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages about half of the book is dedicated to the convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time i think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose after a while you get the feeling loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you and it really interferes with the flow of the book further a lot but not all of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet the claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine and peppered throughout the book but it 's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited one last nitpick one great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world it 's a pity the recipes included do not explore those but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining i found the recipes far too traditional and
i learned a lot of new things by reading this book ! for example in chapter 22 greene writes that afghanistan was rich in natural gas and other minerals and had ports on the indian ocean '' perhaps the strategy of war should be studying the map before writing books on strategy and tactics
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror doom and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia '' is this is n't a spoiler just the author 's note at the end of the book we read 10 nov 10 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted the other king books i 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification insomnia 's '' ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with he is strong kind has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable his counterpart lois chasse does n't come across as identifiable instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph king does n't usually do that with his secondary characters other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable like ed and helen deepenau the three bald doctors and ralph 's numerous confidantes then there 's the whole abortion mess this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker albeit with a tranparently slant it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself 'how is king going to get through this ' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert 's narration via third person that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him this is a useful tool for a beginning writer but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning one last thing the villians just do n't work they are not frightening they are not demonic they are not vicious or malign three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors their defining characteristics are being small and does that really frighten anyone the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness then there 's the crimson king the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a catfish in one of the most terrible scenes ever rendered i rest my case
i 'd read most of king 's stuff during the uh decade of my ute salem 's lot and pet cemetery being the hook on the line and the stand shining christine and it reeling me in i thought he 'd never come out with a book that i did n't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife 's stuff and the gunslinger series then one day i started to read insomnia and i could n't make it to the halfway point the antichristian proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and i found myself throwing insomnia away i did that with cider house rules by john irving too even needful things with it 's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti catholism and hypocrisy but insomnia was just plain mean spirited
this is a tedious by the numbers biography that reads like an appointment diary the authors have done their research but a biography should be more than a who dined where on such and such a date most of this was gained from kay 's journals little insight is given to who kay francis was as a person which is crucial to a biography the book concentrates and inordinate amount of time on kay 's love life and the list of her lovers gets quite tedious after awhile the book is less than 200 pages long and is a paperback the pictures are nice but one expects more from a book for this price most of her films are judged by film reviewer quotes giving the impression the authors couldnt be bothered to view the films themselves this is definitely the lesser of the 2 recent kay francis biographies i dont really understand the rave reviews for this book as it is one of the most disappointing hollywood biographies i 've read in quite awhile
this book was a gift and that is the only reason i am not returning it the story is bizarre which in and of itself is not bad but this is bad luckily my daughter found it as painful as i did to read zero appeal on any level if you want great bizarre try heedly pecked me in the eye '' !
i ca n't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars i was completely disappointed the book included very little useful information to help kids make good nutritional fruits and veggies are awesome '' was about the extent of it the text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud and the illustrations are not appealing i am returning this book
this book is so outdated all the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980 's and earlier which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past there are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
i agree the book has many many good insights and most of it makes sense you can theoretically use his techniques but sometimes they are just unrealistic in situations also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited i would not buy this again it 's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee it seriously lacks depth but it 's a decent read but you will forget everything you read in 2 days i 'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money time and effort
if you 're thinking of reading this book let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy really and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners but this book in perfectly plain english sucked there is no plot no beginning middle or end and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
podhoretz the man who recently said what 's the big deal about a few thousand dead 's in iraq considering what 's at stake without having a clue that nothing is at stake norman disparages the of the 's that do n't fall in line with his ideology while today he lauds the conservative egomaniacs that have brought our country to its low level of intellectualism and turned a nation founded by intellectual deists into a disneyworld of mcreligion but it 's all fine so long as we make the world safe for democracy norman seems to think there is something hypocritical about professing social justice and being a small time celebrity when in fact as freud said the partial motivation of any artist '' is fame and the love of women speaking i assume of male artists einstein enjoyed the limelight everyone enjoys the limelight and everyone has his or her weaknesses have you ever read einstein 's poetry yuk ! so to disparage the ones you do n't happen to like is a bit disingenuous the true irony is that only an egotist would write a book about such trivial nonsense but this is all in keeping with a man who explains what writers should be writing if they only knew better he applauded james baldwin 's early career because he was on his way to being another henry james he condemns him when baldwin 's attention turned to racism in america imagine that a black writer distraught over racism in america the very idea ! i think norm 's whole problem can be traced back to his youth which he relates in his autobiography making it '' talking about taking the subway from culturally challenged brooklyn to manhattan growing up as a nice jewish boy the son of modest working class parents attending college and rising among the ranks of the intellectual new york crowd nowadays norm is comparing the invasion of iraq to the invasion of normandy and explains that iraq will become democratic by using as an analogy ii germany 's quick transition to a modern democracy of course with the help of 2 million allied troops occupying it how did this guy ever have friends to begin with
podhoretz is just a thug ! he justifies the comment of a viennese one hundred years ago hermann bialohlawek scholarship is what one jews steals from another
as an avid reader a feminist and newly engaged to be married i was thrilled to see that the third wave feminist grrls from bust '' magazine had edited a book on marriage to add to my excitement it was published by the very cool seal press and had a forward by my hero bell hooks it was severely disappointing ! based on my previous experience i expected honest daring endearing funny stories from a variety of self actualized women instead i got boring stories about how marriage is what last name the baby gets and is lesbian marriage real '' marriage clearly the editors did n't do a very good job seeking out qualified submissions something with attitude something where theory meets praxis to top it off even the forward from bell hooks was bland she discusses her legacy with feminism and leaves out discussing marriage ! a good book about feminism and marriage is despretly needed it 's such a difficult area for all of us partnered thinking humans sex and the city '' is doing great why ca n't we have a book version and i do n't think the rules '' counts
i decry supernaturalism in all its forms '' writes richard dawkins in the god delusion i am attacking god all gods anything and everything supernatural wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented '' 36 on closer inspection it becomes clear that insanely dawkins is attacking life in all its forms including his own life and believes that life is an invention dawkins is too deluded or irrational to comprehend that god is everlasting life and that we are the reproductions of that everlasting common ancestor see psalm 82 i said are gods you are all sons of the most high ' '' so if we are gods the sons of the cosmic system 's creator then richard dawkins is one of the gods because he 's attacking all gods '' most irrationally he 's attacking himself as well the main point i want to make is that the most high 's identity does n't remain unidentified in the bible in john christ identifies himself with the existing highest form of life with the parent seed of the universe i and the father are one '' on top of that in revelation christ discloses i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end '' christ is the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end '' because he constitutes the cosmic system 's input and output or everlasting genotype of the phenotype universe thus in essence christ is teaching that he is the embodiment of the existing highest form of life and he created the universe for the production of human beings in his own image similarly as a seed creates a mighty tree for the production of seeds in its own image when dawkins asks but how does life get started he 's asking a stupid question that has only an equally stupid answer which he does n't fail to provide we can make the point that however improbable the origin of life might be we know it happened on earth because we are here 137 it is beyond his comprehension that what is everlasting needs no origin and because life is everlasting it needs no origin pitifully this oxford biology professor seems to be ignorant of the principle of biogenesis in the publication of his own university in the oxford dictionary of biology oxford university press 2000 we find biogenesis the principle that a living organism can only arise from other living organisms similar to itself that like gives rise to like and can never originate from nonliving material '' read also what the science and technology encyclopedia university of chicago press 1999 says about the subject of biogenesis biological principle maintaining that all living organisms derive from parent s generally similar to themselves this principle was originally established in opposition to the idea of spontaneous generation of life on the whole it still holds good despite variations in individuals caused by mutations hybridization and other genetic effects '' let me add that no biological generalization is more strongly supported by thoroughly tested evidences than the principle of biogenesis and because the scientific evidence is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that life can never originate from nonlife only from life similar to itself it is an entirely reasonable and consequently scientific conclusion that there was never a time when life did not exist and human life could come only from human life similar to itself from this it also follows that the myth of life 's origin from nonlife moreover the myth of man 's descent from lower forms of life should finally be abandoned at least in scientific circles ironically many evolutionists and even theologians are in the habit of assuring us that the accounts of creation in the bible are not but however it is beyond any doubt that this is a misconception even philip christ 's disciple demanded tangible evidence for the creator 's existence christ without hesitation presented the father 's body for philip 's examination in john we find this exchange of words philip said to jesus lord show us the father and we shall be satisfied '' jesus said to him have i been with you so long and yet you do not know me philip he who has seen me has seen the father how can you say us the father ' '' paul in his letter to the colossians also assures us that christ is the creator of the universe and not something what is intangible or empirically not verifiable by him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible all things were created by him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together '' logically christ being the generative seed of the universe is everlasting the universe has no power whatsoever to act upon the initial cause of its own origin just as a tree has no power to act upon its own parent seed at this point the argument may be raised that man is not the cosmic system 's input and output or pinnacle of all life forms in the universe indeed whether it is true or not we ca n't be absolutely certain precisely for this reason the theory of creation is tentative just as scientific theories are supposed to be in any case just because we are not absolutely certain that man constitutes the existing highest form of life does not mean that the theory of creation is not but man 's existence is an undeniable fact what is is the speculation that a life form superior to human life exists which superhuman being is reproductively isolated from human life but if either evolutionists or fundamentalists keep insisting in the total absence of evidence that human life is not the pinnacle of life forms in the universe in that case they are the ones who believe in the existence of superhuman beings as a matter of fact christ never told us that anything superior to his own being exists he only affirmed his own existence and his identity with the father but never the existence of a being beyond and above himself being the creator of the universe he is most qualified to know that no being superior to himself ever existed in the final analysis this is my recommendation buy the god delusion by richard dawkins provided you need expensive and substandard toilet paper
i read the works of folks like vince flynn lee child and i thought nelson demille for the escape the action intrigue someting to make the plane flight go faster i do n't read for commentary there are recognized exports available for that sort of thing for example a in vietnam gives neither me nor nelson expert '' status on the conduct of warfare demille as he matures as a person and a writer has taken to slipping his agenda '' into his storytelling consequently the story telling '' aspect of his craft has in my opinion atrophied he of course has that right but i for one am done reading his books there 's always the news if i want current events commentary and better suspense writers if i desire an entertaining escape
when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept i resolved that i would alert other readers generally i enjoy this author 's works and anticipated this latest tome i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it 's clues or probable developments everything was telegraphed and nothing was original the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next
this book has about 3 interesting chapters the rest is all dialog between a man and wife all this chit chat does nothing to further the plot but simply takes up time and space there is no suspense until the chapter take my word for it this book is not worth the or time to read what a waste of talent
a daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the rocket trip to the moon that 's the premise of heinlein 's rocket ship galileo readers who are n't immediately turned off by the story 's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure to begin with heinlein 's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years he skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place and he even manages to build some suspense an effect heinlein is not usually noted for his descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting despite being badly dated one real letdown is the characters who are curiously undeveloped even for science fiction the three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable and doctor cargraves is n't much more distinctive if some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities the readers might find them easier to identify with as it is it 's hard to really care about these characters even when something horrible happens to them the really big problem though is that this book really has n't aged very well for example heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately by one scientist and his youthful helpers working on a shoestring budget after a few months of labor when after all any schoolchild knows that it took nasa and the government billions of dollars working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade to accomplish the real thing once our heroes reach the moon the story gets even more improbable as they find that the moon is already inhabited naturally heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible as such it was written for the tastes of the times and times have changed dramatically for instance the only women in this book are the boys ' mothers who have very little to say about anything important the villains are cartoonish stereotypes who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse although the book is reasonably overall and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet today 's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing on average if you 're old enough to remember sputnik you can be forgiven for loving this book but if neil armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school you probably wo n't be too impressed by rocket ship galileo
this book is appalling it is disempowering to women providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births with no reference to back it up and generally gives a do n't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you '' attitude even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby in spite of what this book says there are things you can do to minimize tearing and episiotomies do n't heal better than tears in spite of what the book says things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions and so on of course there are times these things are needed but not nearly so often as the book suggests and it 's not nearly so random it continually cites opinions as facts without any evidence base there are much much better books out there than this one do n't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book
i know that no book can cover every topic but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness which is much more common and some of the information was just plain wrong i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the week because i could n't feel the baby move it advised that i should call the doctor when i did i found out most women do n't feel it move until 21 weeks unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong i would not suggest this book to anyone
i love koontz but this book fell far from the mark it started off slow and i found myself thinking where is this going '' and in the end i felt it took me nowhere and the elliott quotes got a little annoying if you 're a fan like me i know you 'll read it despite this review but if you 're a koontz reader do n't start with this book it is definitely not his best work try odd thomas or even going way back here the funhouse instead
i have been a fan of dean koontz for many years but i stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago because after awhile it seemed as if all of his characters were the same i recently read the back cover of this book and it sounded so interesting so i gave it a chance boy was i sorry it is as if dean koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student ! his sentences are awkward mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side this was way too distracting and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale please dean take an opportunity to read some ' books on writing
the foundation of success in a horror story is a strong original beginning the author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief dean koontz failed to make this upfront investment in the taking the story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements stormy night body snatchers magic mirrors ghouls and koontz 's favorite delphic dogs before settling down with a very modest storyline about a rapture koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror but the taking provides no such return
i 'm not a hard core dean koontz fan but i have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them at least enough to pick up another from time to time until now i 've always found koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'the taking ' is about as subtle as a hand grenade we get it people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life they should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs the preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'noah 's arc ' ending this the worst novel i 've read in a long time and may be the last dean koontz novel i 'll ever read
i 'm a fan of koontz but this book was a disappointment first of all it seems that not much happens molly the main character goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing it 's too cutesy with children and dogs koontz please the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired for most of the book it would be a 3 star book but the ending is too cheesy and religious what will he write next a left behind '' book
aikman wrote a fair history of of christianity in china however he misrepresents what is going on in china today by far the biggest problem in the chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices this exists almost exclusively in the underground churches aikman wrote a book that caters to the palates of american christian evangelicals who want to hear exactly what aikman is telling them young missionaries '' who have yet to understand the difference between culture and faith or have even critical thinking will use this book to find inspiration and funding as a mandarin speaking christian who has spent considerable time in china i was hoping to like this book if i was not i would proabably think it was very good
i usually try not to be too mean to a new author as i am one myself the plot was predictable boring and simplistic that was not the worst part now to the characters kattan durhys my god he was utterly devoid of passion he was whining on every page and annoying to no end i did not find him endearing at all and skipped every line he spoke who is kattan weakling in tights '' melisande she 's even worse than kattan i ca n't imagine someone more obnoxious and totally empty of compassion and intellect than this character only character worth rooting for other than the dogs he was sharp and actually knew what the heck was going on the pros the songs were nice i wish there were more after all it was supposed to be about a bard hero where were the songs what happened to them whenever that annoying simpleton kattan opened his mouth i ca n't imagine a book where i 've enjoyed less than watching commericials about after shave
google the words foster cline and attachment therapy and be prepared to lose your lunch happy research
i found the book had some ideas that helped but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual but i did n't appreciate the religious opinion it gave
i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making and the consequence of their decision remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors do n't want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position which i would have respected if not agreed with then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i would n't have spent the 22 i would have wanted to know that in advance tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book buyer bewar
but i 'll throw him a bone with a second star see end of review for why first let me qualify myself in a few ways i 'm an atheist so i 'm not attacking dennett on religious grounds second while i believe in the validity of evolutionary psychology i do n't believe in dennett 's evolutionary psychology and are there that many dennett fans here for the negative replies to my review or is something about ev psych ev psych not clear read my review of adapting minds '' david buller 's book or of why men wo n't ask directions '' further down this page the problems with dennett 's book as far as his previous history goes boil down to two things adaptationism and memes adaptationism at least the strong version touted by ev psychers has n't been shown to be true for purely physical evolution for cultural evolution even though it too is ultimately biological it 's got even less proof that it 's anywhere close to a convincing primary explanation see my blog for some recent comments on dennett adaptationism and ev psych versus ev psych or read my review of adapting minds '' david buller 's book or of why men wo n't ask directions '' further down this page second much of dennett 's approach could be explicated without ever reverting to controversial idea no 2 memes if and that 's a big if there 's any truth to memes they 're likely to be much less robust bits of mental heredity than dennett even more than dawkins would have us believe related to that is dennett 's incorrigible urge to translate language and to some degree the ideas behind the language of people like scott atran and pascal boyer into his own i 've read and reviewed both their books on this subject go read them and learn a lot more than in dennett 's tweaked '' transmissions ironically in a book about religion dogmatic '' might be a good word to describe some of dennett 's tendencies in this way now how does dennett shoot himself in the foot in this book in the first 10 pages simple he first says he 's not an expert on academic religious studies nor on eastern religions in general he then runs roughshod over both these on page 10 where he defines religion as including a belief in a theistic deity obviously excluding eastern religions buddhism taoism and confucianism all do make the cut of religion '' in the academy dan but your definition of religion '' does n't this is probably example no 1 to underscore what other reviewers have said as well this book looks like a rush job perhaps to sam harris ' book or otherwise shallow part of that given dennett 's previous writing history is that he has n't done much with religion in academic journals so had no starting point of turning academic essays into book chapters second to skip ahead in the book to pages dennett makes what should be considered elementary errors of logic even if being used to some degree as rhetorical talking points on 272 dennett broaches the possibility that religion makes one healthier mentally more fit etc he nowhere discusses the issue of statistical correlation causal correlation nor even if there is a causal correlation does he consider which way it goes does religion make you healthier or does being healthier make you more religious on 273 he presents the hypothetical talking point that examining the issue of religion making one healthier or mentally more fit might fade under the scientific microscope to broach this as even a halfway serious talking point dennett comes off sounding like paranormal peddlers that james randi and csicop are constantly having to shoot down special pleadings and all there 's lesser errors on top of these but what i 've just listed are train wrecks of logical reasoning can anybody mail dennett a copy of the skeptic 's dictionary maybe this acclaimed philosopher would n't come up so short or so in the logic department as his thought on these two pages indicates and no i 'm not saying this totally tongue in cheek near the end of chapter 9 dennett 's logical reasoning skills are that weak i 'll give the book two stars not one though but only by the skin of its teeth as a popularizing version of some of what atran boyer and harris among others discuss and especially as ostensibly written in a spirit of outreach to a variety of religious believers of at least some depth of faith it rises above the mark but only for that reason
dennett 's book demonstrates the ignorance irrationality and dishonesty of humanists discussing the meaning of word materialsim professor dennett says '' in its scientific or philosophical sense it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial like a cartesian soul or ectoplasm '' or god the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance matter and whatever minds are supposedly made of '' 302 philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism it is naturalism materialism is the view that all that exists is matter materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena in a quote below you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist but he is certainly a naturalist concerning the proof of god 's existence he trots out david hume 's who made god '' which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof let 's look at two quotes the first is at the end of the chapter belief in belief '' and the other at the beginning of the chapter morality and religion '' '' that is is n't it true that whether or not god exists religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy in the rule of law in free will the very widespread but far from universal opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning '' 245 '' without the divine carrot and stick goes this reasoning people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires beak their promises cheat on their spouses neglect their duties and so on there are two problems with this reasoning 1 it does n't seem to be true which is good news since 2 is is such a demeaning view of human nature '' 279 in the first chapter he mentions bulwark of morality '' and meaning '' but in the second chapter he leaves out meaning '' if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven what is our purpose is life whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians there are worse things than divorcing your spouse disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life the only miracle mentioned in dennett 's book is the shroud of turin which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man since no one claims to know how the image got there it can be called a miracle however dennett does not tell us anything about it the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet
tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts '' or scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea '' provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture '' if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture '' based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period '' series see prophecy house 's web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items
intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new web 2.0 '' universe i was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis from the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author 's argument the book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance i would qualify it as a light business read entertaining but not quite convincing if you 're not part of the choir
this book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book this has been noted by others anything of interest is said in the first chapter followed by a lot of fluff sometimes the crowd is wise '' sometimes the crowd is not wise '' after the first chapter i seriously could n't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored
i am an adult with adhd inatintive type i have struggled all my life with this condition howevere i have managed to earn a ba in psychology and i am currently working on a masters degree because of my expierences in psychology classes i know something about scientific research and empirical evidence this book was a major dissapointment to me because it lacks the simple scholary research to prove the claims made by dr lawless i am afraid this book is nothing more then modernday that will cause more harm then good this book is so full of that i fear it may cause a great deal of harm to children and adults with adhd lawless is a psychologist and should now how to read the scientifice research on the subject found in peer reviewed journals while i believe that the chemeicals in the foods we eat are a major cause of illnesses adhd and obesity there is little scientific evidence that add is caused by diet however their maybe more evidence in the future one of his clames of red dye has been proven completly false another one his claims about magnet theropy are so out of the scientific mainstream that he comes of as a snakeoils salesman please do not buy this book if you want reliable information by on of the driven to distraction books
there are many great ideas presented in this book about dealing with your add child but the chapter on meds is completely off base let me preface the following with my opinion i am not an md or an expert that children with add need a team approach in helping them deal with the condition if you choose to call it one and there is a place for meds for many kids but it is only a piece of the puzzle parents teachers family members md 's and behavioral specialists are all crucial i happen to work indirectly with many of the world thought leaders and experts on add ie joseph beiderman mass general hospital boston harvard medical school look up his credentials first frank lawlis is not an md this means he has not been to medical that is not to say he is n't a great psychologist just that he has not and does not write prescriptions for these meds and has no first hand experience with directly managing these meds himself in this book there are many things that are completely false regarding add meds for example he states that they only work for about 50 of kids false let me cite 3 credible sources that disputes this notice in the book that he does not talk about his credible source 1 approx 70 of patients respond to the first stimulant agent administered with resulting improvement in their adhd symptoms '' practical considerations in stimulant drug selection for the adhd efficacy potency and titration beiderman today 's therapeutic trends 02 ' 2 improvement occurred in of patients randomized to stimulants '' practice parameter for the use of stimulant medication in the treatment of children adolescents and adults journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry ' 3 at least 80 of children will respond to one of the stimulants if they are tried in a systemic way '' clinical practice guideline treatment of the child with adhd published in american acedemy of pediatrics oct 01 ' all of these quotes are credible and are opinions based on medicine from the experts lawlis also states that there has been little research in children and that most studies have been done on adults and this is completely false ! the journal noted above journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry that was a review of 161 randomized controlled trials that have been published encompassing 5 preschool 150 7 adolescent and 9 adult studies '' where does lawlis get his information the review noted above by the american acedemy of pediatrics identified for analysis 2405 citations 92 reports and 78 different studies this is american acedemy of they are only interested in children and adolescents ! not rats mice and adults these are the most credible medical journals published these are not the biased trials sponsored by big pharma the information in these journals is taken very seriously by pediatricians and child psychiatrists and is heavily relied upon by these professionals lastly he also states that these drugs are identical to cocaine in their affect on the brain this is not true they have similarities but by identical yes it is true that stimulant medications can be abused and can also be addictive but some of the newer formulations of these meds have lessened their abuse and addictive potential by altering the speed at which the drug is released into the bloodstream thereby somewhat flattening the curve cocaine use produces a curve that is almost straight is what gives the high '' the most common way for these drugs to be abused is by crushing them and snorting them which allows for fast absorption and steep curve and some of the newer meds are crush resistant can not be turned into a fine enough substance to be snorted there has also been data published that shows a decrease not increase in drug abuse for patients who have taken stimulants it is believed that kids who are treated drug treatment and otherwise are less likely to associate with kids who are failing and who are more likely to be using drugs this is not to say that high all high achievers abstain from using or that all children who are failing are using it is just a point that kids who are treated are more likely to be focused on school and their responsibilities and are less likely to be involved in drug use kids who are failing in school are often looked at as outcasts and are often looked down upon by peers teachers and family and this can cause a child to look for an escape sometimes drugs children who do benefit from stimulant medication sometimes have more because of their success and certainly less scrutiny from peers teachers etc lastly lawlis tells a story about a man who died from stimulant medication i am not going to say that this did not happen but i will say that stimulants have been used since the 1950 's and the medical community agrees that they are safe when managed properly the medical community and fda have pulled many medications that were deemed unsafe from the markets many times against the will of big pharma and the stimulants would not have remained on the market for over 50 years if stories like this were common or the least bit likely i am not at all stating that stimulant meds are the answer because they are not but they can be a small piece of the puzzle that is helping these kids with add the book is full of great ideas and approaches to add but he is not accurate about the stimulant medications parents who see value in them should not feel ashamed and or frightened by what he says because most of it is just not accurate good luck and i hope this was helpful
according to the nimh there are about 1.6 million cases if the rest of this book is as accurate as that statistic then well that pretty much says it all
in this book 's intro it says it 's no coincidence you opened this book '' then you see everytime a coincidence occurs a prayer is answered or something happens to make you say 'wow ! what are the odds of that happening ' you 've received a godwink a signpost along the path to your message of reassurance that you are never alone '' besides that contradiction here is more but first here 's some wishful thinking advice from his book '' if you have faith in the outcome the picture you 've seen in your mind can be yours '' yep this is another book rehashing the if you have enough faith '' fairytale but here are the contradictions he goes on to say you are destined to have a soulmate relationship godwinks are signposts of reassurance guiding you into making your own free will decisions '' what the hell so you are destined and godwinks are to show you that you are n't alone no wait they are reassurances to guide you into making your own free will decisions because you control your own destiny oh but that 's not all on page 143 he said you must continue to listen to the small still voice make the important choices in your like on your own bolstered by an awareness that you are surrounded by the invisible safety net of the almighty confirmed by godwinks that you are never alone '' that 's some great comfort from god to let you know that you are on your own when it comes to making decisions and he 's not gon na help at all and even causes coincidences to reassure you that he 's not gon na help and reminds you to make all the hard choices without any help and is just gon na watch and continue to remind you that he 's doing this oh and let the power of coincidences lead you to love '' wait so now god uses coincidences to tell you who to marry or have sex with and you should choose using your free will to go with god 's i thought he was n't helpin out with the hard choices advice do n't give this book to anyone unless you want them to end up in a mental institute and saying free will '' is redundant of course it 's free it seems like this author has an bias and in his bias is fine with wrecking the minds of those he is trying to make money off of
when wanda brought this thing home and threw it at me i thought it might be that copy of american squirrel hunter magazine i asked her to pick up i got up to chapter 8 before i realized it ai n't got nothing to do with varmint hunting at all not for me
this miniature edition is too small to be of much value when i purchased it it was not at all obvious that it was a miniature edition and i was shocked when it arrived if you 're already familiar with the book it may be a helpful reminder but it is no way to become familiar with peale 's work it is not worth the 4.95 i paid for it and the 3.99 shipping and handling is ludicrous
i 'm glad to see i 'm not the only one to notice the preaching in this book not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that i was expecting to learn a lot more most of the things mentioned i already knew i graduated from high school in and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education
davis 's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling white men were all bad indians were good women were brave conservatives are republicans are bad and pro business was silly and all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor 's filter davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy this is offensive when it neglects margaret sanger 's racism and communist depredations
there should be no typos in a edition but go ahead and count them not just in the text but problems as well there are times when formulas in the body of chapters are wrong or other times when you do n't have all the info needed to answer one of the problems universities and instructors should be ashamed of themselves for making you spend 120 on this
if you want a biased and misleading account of the arab war against israel this ought to satisfy you shlaim tells us that jabotinsky in discussing zionism explained that if the cause is just justice must triumph '' i think jabotinsky made a very good point here you see human beings will if given the chance tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in the ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land if injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here in particular it would mean a prosperous israel and a triumph for zionism shlaim appears to have missed all this to him zionism is unjust and to him the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable he tells us that a new independent levantine arab state is inevitable '' i disagree it may be likely but it would serve no purpose it would not help jews arabs or others its only purpose would be to damage israel the people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language religion culture cuisine or foreign policy so i think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here shlaim also tells us that this new arab state will be weak demilitarized and territorially divided '' is it just possible that this if true provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all and could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable or at least less desirable and the author also explains that both sides in the conflict will have to make painful compromises '' and that jerusalem will have to be the subject of hard bargaining '' really is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise for either side of course not shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war poverty and destruction are somehow less painful had shlaim been writing about france and germany we 'd have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense he 'd have been telling us that the german national socialists needed an independent state in france either to replace all of france or part of it he would have laughingly dismissed french claims on the basis of the entire idea of france being unjust ! he 'd have sternly explained that a german national socialist state in france was both desirable and inevitable and he would have discussed the necessary painful compromises '' for both sides and the hard bargaining '' about paris there are plenty of reasonable books about the arab war against israel this is n't one of them
this book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then i personally ca n't avoid every 'unperfect ' dog until then it goes over desentization not rocket science but does n't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues i 'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction ' theory it 's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it 's or real aggression concerns
since i do n't normally write reviews i 'll not try to make this clever i was completely disappointed in this latest attempt from vince flynn though i love the character of mitch rapp in this novel he read like a cardboard of the mitch rapp in all previous books as i read i tried to analyze what was going on well he just been through a big loss very traumatic flynn is trying to show the audience that mitch has been profoundly altered by the experience flynn will deal with this head on at some point in the novel '' he never does the whole interaction between kennedy and rapp at the end of the book feels like it was written by an grader its out of character and unbelievable for two seasoned intelligence professionals completely without subtlety i 've now come to the conclusion that as a writer flynn has lost the hunger is too full of himself now that he 's made it '' and has friends in high places my husband is a writer i know the difference between when he 's producing junk and when he 's in the creative zone writer coming together with words not satisied until he 's melded creative energy to insight to produce art it appears that flynn hurried threw this together a great disappointment to his fans who have followed mitch since term limits and connected with his ability to read a situation act decisively and remain in control objectives intact i 've already sold this book though i wo n't part with the others and i 'll be more careful before i buy flynn 's next offering my advice to vince remember why you started writing i 'll bet it was n't to produce books of mediocity
i was looking for a real thriller and thought i would try one by david baldacci i had read a very favourable review a while back and i have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of absolute power after reading reviews at amazon i picked last man standing however i was really disappointed for me it was n't thrilling at all several times i had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading for me a good thriller is a book you ca n't stop reading even if it 's getting late and you really really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading examples of great thrillers i have read are the firm by john grisham the day after tomorrow by allan folsom nothing to do with the movie of the same name and angels and demons by dan brown but last man standing was quite the opposite sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while the final for example but those times were quite rare i 've been trying to figure out why i did n't like it but i ca n't say i know why i do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite especially the reason the hero web london froze during the ambush and that the characters are pretty but that 's not enough of a reason both the day after tomorrow and angels and demons have plenty of twists and characters but they were still exciting reads i ca n't come up with a definite answer as to why i did n't like last man standing i simply just did n't care for it writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes but i think it is important to also review books you did n't like otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view however i do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked but to finish if you are looking for a good thriller skip this one and try one of the other three i mentioned above
i have read baldacci 's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them this one however is just awful not only the character 's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows with lame lines like the gun was loaded and so was i '' that is exactly what this book is like except it goes on for 400 pages there is n't a single interesting character in this book in my opinion you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end it 's the bataan death march of novels i hope this is an aberration i 'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good but one more stinker like this one and i 'll drop his name from my reading list
what a waste of time this book is good for one thing it reminded of something i need to work on my stubbornness sometimes i can be just too stubborn for my own good when i was reading this i just would n't quit and had to go all the way to the end this will teach me thank you baldacci ! here is a synopsis of the book a '' is the biggest strongest man in the world no way ! b '' is the biggest strongest how can they be if c '' was in the most awesome group of men in the world then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest strongest and smartest of them all thank you again david ! this would have received a 1 star except i was reminded of the lesson i needed
i found this book to repetitive it just keeps going on and on on how bad web feels about the death of his 7 team mates also it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that do n't really add to the story at all it just adds to the stereotype of how life is in annacostia washington dc one such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid she is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements i do n't recommend this book at all but if you are a narrow minded white male who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest this book is for you
the 2002 version of the star wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original it upgrades some underpowered character classes adds some breadth and makes improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook unfortunately the central crippling problem with the 1999 version remains the system just is n't to star wars storytelling playing this game is nothing like playing out a star wars story and a lot like playing dungeons and dragons in space star wars is fluid and dynamic and not much concerned with power balance a kid fresh off the moisture farm can fight his way past elite enemy troops to save the princess and one sith lord can arrange the downfall of the entire jedi order audacity and heroic or villainous attitudes matter more than experience and major characters rarely die and then only if there 's a strong dramatic reason for it plotlines are loose and a game based on star wars should reflect that by contrast is very and very regulated and much too lethal concepts like level '' class '' and hit points '' are fundamental to the system but are not very applicable to the star wars universe the system has a lot going for it and it 's great for dungeons and dragons but here it 's a case of trying to stuff a square peg into a round hole i prefer the west end games '' version released in the late it has its flaws it does n't deal with very powerful characters as well as it might and character creation could use some tuning particularly for pcs but it captures the feel of star wars a revision of that rule system or a completely new system incorporating the best features of both and would have been a much better choice than using the system as a '' set of mechanics however it seems unlikely that wizards of the coast will forsake their flagship system for something as as star wars so i suggest that if you really want to get into gaming in the star wars universe look for a used copy of the west end games version
well you know the rest aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired these meals can not be done in 30 minutes unless that is if you want everything half cooked the book makes false promises and does not deliver there are also no pictures and no index and the recipes are very of them deriving from an original master recipe and then just changing one or two things if you want good food and a good cook book do n't buy into the hype and do n't buy this book
i 've heard a lot about ray 's show on the food network so i thought this book might be an interesting addition to my library i was wrong unfortunately i did n't scan the book before buying it or else it would still be on the shelf most of my gripes have been covered now that i have read them un organized no index and to be honest uninspiring recepies 30 minute meals i do n't think so given the time it takes to find what 's needed to create a meal most of them seem to be the kind that were passed down by word of mouth and not researched is ray a chef i do n't think so and am not sure what her credentials actually are so i ca n't recommend it unless your a die hard fan of her and want all her merchandise

this book was interesting at first it shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like but that only takes a chapter after that it just keeps repeating itself over and over who do you think bought the 1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch '' yeah yeah i get it the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending no real wealth guy then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point i want real examples i do n't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity but do n't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it is n't real then there is the advice on being frugal i am pretty frugal but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if i had to live like that sure i could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget but then i would n't be very happy who cares if i have a million when i 'm if i had to live miserably up until then what is that worth i know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car but driving around my 20 year old jeep is no fun either ! this book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender people with common sense need not buy this book just check it out at the library like i did
i wish sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels that flow and voice i understood so well at first sight felt like i was reading a deadline novel just words no insight did n't make this reader think at all sorry just the way i read it
i gagged my way through the notebook but thought i would give nicholas sparks another try i read about of the book and decided it was a waste of my time
i have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote at first sight like me you probably loved all the characters in his previous books he makes every character in this book not loveable ! i kept asking myself who am i rooting for do i care if things go well the best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book could have been a story in itself i miss the old spark
this book was on the bestseller 's shelf at my local bookstore i asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews shocking as a number of other customer 's have commented on this site this book was not worth the money it cost it was silly contrived and unrealistic the cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time i typically do n't read romance novels but i ca n't begin to imagine that that 's possible
i have n't read many books written by patterson but i liked the notebook so i thought i would read some of his other publications i did n't find much to like about at first sight the story is totally unbelievable and the characters it is a boiler plate romance novel the couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart a wave of a wand and they both know they love each other the happy couple then find and overcome adversity patterson is not a bad writer if you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read you wo n't be disappointed if you want a realistic story and believeable characters then at first sight is n't for you
the author has a decent touch with action sequences few though they are in this book and he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story but he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened why did this clue appear earlier what is the significance of this event what trends should we see based on events so far '' very clumsy style which veers into hardy boys book territory but when he finishes explaining everything that 's happended so far he writes competently if you got the book free and like the genre it 's worth reading on a plane
jesus what a narcassist i mean is this guy for real why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over the emperor has no clothes people ! the only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes he had such staggering debt he would have sunk the love to know what his net worth really you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid maybe a paternity test is in order how to get rich drive up ur debt to such a level and owe so many creditors that they can not afford to call in your
when is everyone going to learn there is no such thing as a book the title for the book is a joke itself trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title seriously if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich why would he tell you this book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of the apprentice there is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality ! the advice is so mundane half of the book is memoirs of a week as trump boooring and i do n't want to read about the show in the last chapter i can not believe this book was published the writing stinks and there is even some typos trump may produce quality buildings but that can not be said of his books
if you have 10 million dollars and you are losing 100 thousand dollars a day then this book might be helpful if you are not a millionaire then this book is not for you i can give you better advice on how to get rich than trump i understand he knows more than i do however he does not share a damn thing with you in his book
many of the recipes use an abundance of heavy cream half and half whole milk or butter i 'm sure these dishes taste good but people i cook for do n't need to eat such rich food
save your time money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous predictable stone barrington novel the short forever '' wow this one stinks like others i put up with the shallow characters ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance and come to think of it who gives a damn i do n't what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character save for isabel the maid felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb vacuous and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic ! the only normal female character who spared stone mary ann unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought
cute describes these books in the series pleasant a little fun a little insipid but really not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study actually in contrast to more than one other reviewer i found the presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory this is not an untried method being also used in the easylearn language audio programs and other texts those word stickers do n't stay on too long though be prepared to lose a lot of them
my wife and i have now spent a good month learning '' with this book in fact more than 10 minutes a day more like 30 minutes per session we both speak other languages so we can compare good nice thematic picture groups and you need to learn the words associated with them we did bad again and again kershul introduces words and grammar which do not fit into the just mastered '' scheme of things irritating to the extreme kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of english and italian in one sentence we would have preferred one line of italian only followed by one line say in italics providing the english translation in many cases preferably with an explanations how this compares to what was done yesterday '' bad in attempt to not introduce grammar you are left high and dry figuring out gender declinations and worse conjugations by yourself we have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things ' and we are half way through the book in anger we finally went to the local library and got a 70 years old italian grammar for high schools that did solve our problem and left us convinced that new and improved '' does not necessarily provide a better learning experience somewhat irritating ms kershuls 's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives not an uncle niece grandson cousin grandparent or daughter is forgotten in the family tree 2. you wish to order meals and buy stuff '' constantly we assure you that is the one thing italians are very good at understanding english when you want to buy things or order a meal 3. you wish to tell italians that you are american '' as if our accents and clothing are not 4. you pray catholic '' protestant '' or hebrew '' the italians we know could n't care less how about instead politics '' music '' movies '' soccer '' and the bella ragazza '' over there in summary we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be easy in 10 minutes a day '' but emphasizes grammar groups vocabulary and discusses alternatives for each new word provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation example telefono versus incorrect telefono teaches italian as a language of constructed '' full sentences rather than single catch words '' our final test no we would not recommend this book to a friend
what this book says is to eat less and exercise more this is supposed to be new and insightful advice the step counter that came with the book is crummy the battery rattles around in the thing and the steps do n't count correctly
i have read crossing the chasm '' and inside the tornado '' by moore both very good books ! when i first laid my eyes on this book i had a slight feeling that there might be risk of overlap i think wiefelds saw this as well and got a good endorsement by his colleague moore to state that this is a complement not a repetition that the book was published after the in 2002 felt reassuring though a lot of good lessons were probably to be learned for the reader ok so i had high expectations but felt a slight doubt after reading the book i have two statements 1. the book delivers some more hands on the two books it referrers to some really good lists all in all about nine pages of good time material 2. i am very sad that wiefelds did not listen to his own good recommendation do n't talk about your product as you know it know your target group ! wiefelds should know that i am not planning on reading this book for fun i want a high not 352 pages that take a week to read when a 20 page leaflet would be sufficient ! because the book is repetitive very ! to summarize the book offers some good hands on tips and lists but should have been a 20 page leaflet
glenn reynolds is n't known as the blogfather '' for nothing the tennesee law professor was one of the first among the intelligentsia to see the potential of web logs or blogs to change the media landscape as a daily reader of reynolds ' for 5 years i am continually impressed with his analysis breadth of interest and his posts are short pithy and droll but judging from an army of davids '' those bloggy qualities that have made reynolds an online force do n't carry over well into the book world reynolds ' conversational style serves him well on the web where his analytical and nuggets of insight perfectly suit today 's online attention span army '' is basically a collection of lengthy blog posts united by the theme that technology is increasingly empowering individuals socially economically and politically for better and for worse reynolds makes this argument most effectively in the first half of the book when the discussion focuses on blogging and media the second half ventures into more fantastic territory by touching on biotech nanotech and space travel and it 's here where the book transmogrifies more into futuristic musings about reynolds ' pet causes a cure for ageing homebrew molecular manufacturing and nuclear powered spacecraft that 's bombs not reactors all fascinating stuff but i 'm still not sure how that fits on the same page as citizen journalism and home music studios that brings me to my main problem with army '' in the end it 's less a systematic study of the probable areas where technology enables average people to nudge society in new directions than it is a collection of stuff that glenn reynolds finds really cool and sort of crams under this broad umbrella of individual empowerment one specific complaint i have focuses on the chapter on space travel titled space it 's not just for governments anymore '' reynolds rightly points out the deep flaws in our approach to space he illustrates how entrepreneurs like burt ratan to jeff bezos and john carmack will drive the next era of spaceflight at costs that are a tiny fraction of the government 's approach but in the next breath reynolds laments how we are in danger of losing the spacerace to china which is pursuing exactly the big government highly secretive approach that has led the to a cosmic not only that reynolds speculates the chinese could beat us with the aforementioned nuclear spacecraft an approach that was abandoned by the decades ago due to significant technological environmental and diplomatic risks china has made exactly two manned spaceflights both using era technology copied from the soviets their nuclear arsenal is limited to a few score of warheads but suddenly they are going to find enough fissionable material to create the thousands of bombs needed to power such a spacecraft and moreover manage to test prototypes in complete secrecy without triggering any suspicious seismographical readings it just does n't compute i also find it odd that army '' was published as a traditional book you 'd think that reynolds ' enthusiasm for cheap new technologies would lead him to offer it as a pdf download or even an of course online media is not a replacement for print media any more than tv was a replacement for radio and no one can begrudge a desire to see if it 's possible to translate online success into a publishing one but it would have been the ultimate validation of the very technologies reynolds spends 270 pages endorsing
first off i am a young conservative and as such i should like this book a lot of my friends have recommended it to me and i loved what 's so great about america '' and got a lot out of the end of racism '' however i have three problems with letters '' its arguments are too superficial it has no logical target audience and its arguments are sometimes faulty for the record i know that the book is designed to offer brief arguments for a wide variety of conservative positions but four pages or so apiece the ideas barely scratch the surface of conservative thought if d'souza increased the length of the book by about 50 percent and cut out some of the lesser essays the one on gun control might as well have been two words long john lott '' he could get more into each issue second it 's hard to tell who the book is aimed at its title would imply that young conservatives should read it but if you do n't know almost everything that 's in this book you are n't knowledgeable enough to call yourself a conservative maybe young liberals can learn something about the perspective but if they know enough about their own positions they probably also know everything contained in this little gem '' there 's an argument to be made that high schools and colleges do n't teach conservative thought so some of the ideas here might be new to a young liberal but in that case lefties are sure to be put off by the tasteless jokes about homosexuality and the wording ditto for people who know almost nothing about politics they 're likely to end the book thinking that conservatives simply delight in making others uncomfortable finally as basic as most of the essays are some of them have flawed logic for instance d'souza states that liberals think human nature is good while conservatives think it 's bad this ca n't explain why liberals think people need to be forced to give to the poor nor why conservatives think humans are capable of making their own economic decisions both liberals and conservatives think human nature is good and bad only in different ways another ridiculous argument is when he responds to allegations that quotes in his previous books are taken out of context he says that all quotes are out of context otherwise he 'd have to quote the whole speech or book in question i 'm sorry but this has no merit if i 'm talking about monopoly and say i always beat my girlfriend '' and then someone puts that in an article about domestic violence that 's what we commonly refer to as out of context '' it 's ridiculous to deny that out of context '' can ever be a meaningful concept essentially this is far from the of starter books for conservatives i wish i had something else to recommend in its place but every time i 've read a book like this i 've ended up disappointed i 'd advise getting into each issue separately for this d'souza 's recommended reading list at the end is actually useful
if you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book the book quite disappointingly does n't present logical arguments which is quite putting off for a rational reader i 'll quote an example from chapter 9 why government is the problem '' it is one thing for the government to provide the basic necessities of life to the truly needy '' people a group that would include the poor the sick and the disabled it is another thing for government to take resources from one family and give them to another family this happens when for example the government builds a mass transit system people who prefer to drive cars must prefer to pay for the transportation preferences of the people who prefer to take the subway '' now from above argument it seems that people driving cars are doing some kind of charitable favour to people taking the subway but how about people riding in subways paying for the other people drive their vehicles on and similarily all over the book the arguments are pretty loose and unappealing another example in chapter 14 why professors are so '' conservatives tend to go to business because they care more about money liberals tend to into the academy because they care more about power '' i am not sure if i understand the above argument but it seems illogical for people to join academia if they are hungry for power do n't know if there is a how to become a us senator for dummies '' but i do n't think it would recommend becoming a faculty member in an ivy league school if one is looking for a seat in congress
this book while mostly fluent and often entertaining is fundamentally flawed in the interest of full disclosure i come to this judgment as a fan of both bush and ronald reagan as a and atheist as an open 'bisexual ' who rejects the notion of 'gay ' identity as a fan of the likes of chesterton christopher hitchens ann coulter ayn rand camille paglia and william buckley and as a reader who wanted to like this book the work has three main flaws it is too ambitious for the skill and effort demonstrated it preaches to the choir and it is gratuitously snide and condescending the book gets off to a rough start on page three where d'souza begins the term liberal '' in its ! greek meaning '' this is a sloppy mistake from a stanford scholar and former senior white house analyst '' is a latin root the greek for free man is eleutheros '' the author and editor both deserve a ruler across the knuckles from fr grammaticus for that mistake saying he has matured from his sophomoric days d'souza tries to hard to be serious yet funny at best he comes across as less witty than buckley less biting than coulter less than paglia and totally out of rand 's league whom he damns with faint praise in his suggested reading list perhaps this last comparison is unfair and of course as d '' souza says making lefties '' turn apoplectic is loads of fun a politically correct college professor once told my all white literature class that we were all ignorant racists '' who could n't even prove we exist ed '' in response the editor of my college paper threw a penknife at the prof 's head which stuck in the wall behind him with a thud six inches from his left ear when asked whether the knife existed '' the professor responded class dismissed '' d'souza 's reported college exploits pale in comparison second the book never puts forth any original solutions or formulations it merely reassures an admittedly young conservative '' that liberals are often worth laughing at this may be quite true but republican ann coulter and marxist christopher hitchens do so write so and say so much better their works are quite highly recommended d'souza offers no arguments other than the implied equation finally d'souza 's repeated jabs at homosexuals are inappropriate and his suggestion that conservatives forget about '' the 'black ' vote is abominable his homophobic a word i hate but which here has no substitute references are embarrassing at one point d'souza nervously jokes that a man says i approve of homosexuality he said half in ernest '' sic during college orientation the fetching d'souza is told to look the person on either side of him '' and realize that at least one of the three '' would have a homosexual experience before leaving college rather than ask as i did at mine how do you know and what gives you the right to lecture me on the topic '' he makes a mental note to avoid '' the two men for his stay at dartmouth fearing what this is more like a bad frat joke than the work of a serious scholar he describes the homosexuality as a lifestyle '' choice yet also seems to believe that homosexuality is involuntary he conflates the gay '' movement which he sometimes seems to realize is a silly modern leftist aberration with which is universal in all cultures the curious and unafraid young conservative '' should research the words and and the stories of achilles hadrian and alexander the great and their loves and while i agree entirely with d'souza 's critique of ' marriage for which he puts forth no serious arguments i do n't see him reaching out here to young homosexual conservatives we do exist his comments on homosexuality in the military were ignorant and frankly incoherent again see the greeks he also nominally distinguishes between individuals of ' heritage and the existence of a community ' yet he advocates that republicans give up '' on blacks and work on attracting latinos and asians as a more expedient political tactic this is rank tribalism partisanship not principle and by asians does he mean anatolians to be brief after reading christopher hitchens ' work letters to a young contrarian '' in the same series i fully hoped to enjoy this book but i can not say it was worth the purchase price i rated it with one star to weight the bias of reviews that praise it the book is worth perhaps two or if one is charitable i have not read d'souza 's other works yet am willing to give him a second chance from a lending library pick up a copy of ann coulter 's paperback edition of how to talk to a liberal '' instead
my only conclusion about the popularity of d'souza is that he writes what his audience loves to hear his opinions and that is all they are opinions with little concern for research analysis and refutation because they are so general must strike a nerve in many 'young conservatives ' who feel they are unappreciated however that does n't make his ideas right regardless of how much one wants them to be that any author would presume to be able to make a comprehensive analysis of current political ideology in so short a book is rather insulting to people who spend their entire lives seeking the truth that this forum is in the form of a 'letter ' is condescending to individuals who want to arrive at truth if one is inquisitive about how the world works why read the views of someone who immediately places himself in a position with the reader why not go out and learn about the world yourself are people so afraid that their biases just might be unfounded if so it does not say much for one 's self confidence that said here is a brief deconstruction of the sadly poorly reasoned perspective of the author chapter by chapter 1 conservatives liberals phony dichotomy as if the country were divided into two mutually exclusive political camps enough said 2 the libertarian temptation if you 're considering what political agenda suits you you use reason to arrive at conservativism any other choice is emotional indulgence not that bush promulgates emotion bring 'em on for or against us ad nauseum or cheney yelled out at a democratic senator during a photo shoot cheney the only congressperson who voted against banning armor piercing bullets during a house vote proposing to ban said ordnance that went through police officers ' bullet proof i guess one libertarian temptation does n't count 3 the education of a conservative this sounds like you were born conservative and needed educating is this a new variation of trait theory 4 pig wrestling at dartmouth i guess every serious book needs a comic chapter title but you 're no shakespeare 5 fighting political correctness you mean political correctness to which you are opposed business suit white shirt red power tie it 's the photo of you on the cover ! suggested title fighting political correctness by being the correct form of political correctness '' 6 authentic bogus multiculturalism there 's authentic and bogus everything politicians agendas 20 bills televangelists etc if you need someone to tell you what is the real thing and what is junk you will always look to others for advice 7 what 's so great about great books logic 101 define tautology '' besides that if you have to explain this to your readers it does n't say much about their own discernment no one should have to explain what is 'great ' learn through experience 8 how reagan outsmarted the liberals drug dealers outsmart the police all the time advertisers outsmart consumers so is 'outsmart ' a positive word not to me 9 why government is the problem you 're not talking about the morass of iraq sponsored by the republican party or the abysmal failure of the bush fema program or the indictments of conservative politicians are you are fire departments the problem is government the entity that created the protection of free speech so people like d'souza could write books the enemy 10 when the rich get richer another lame economic theory the trouble is the rich do n't buy things they already have everything they can invest their profits but the big money is in investing overseas 11 how affirmative action hurts blacks the old argument about class race how about a new problem how outsourcing high tech jobs to india hurts whites '' wo n't win too many conservatives with that one 12 the feminist mistake you mean there is only one i made at least three mistakes today alone ! i bet if you ask him d'zousa would say he does n't make any everyone and every ideology makes mistakes we 're all human 13 who are the postmodernists corporations that 1920 's car designs and haute couture and make a fortune are the only ones of import the rest just sit around 14 why professors are so since business is the number one college major and the is the most sought after college degree this argument is very old and lame not too many finance marketing and management professors are so called left wing '' whatever that means the 60 's are over dude 15 all the news that fits are you really going to a old joke that appeared in mad magazine '' 16 a living constitution if the constitution sat in a vault and no one knew it would it be a constitution i suppose it 's all how you interpret it of course those who are alive and who interpret it make it a living constitution if such people agree with your version it 's valid otherwise it 's a chimera i suppose 17 more guns less crime households with guns have double the rate of suicide than those without guns suicide is a crime i guess you were n't referring to that crime yes guns do n't kill people americans with guns kill people at least in terms of 'civilized societies ' 18 how to harpoon a liberal very revealing metaphor i guess when the whales are all extinct you have to get out your aggression somewhere 19 lies my teacher taught me like the one that stated teddy roosevelt charged up san juan hill why did n't you mention that one 20 was lincoln a bad guy john wilkes booth thought he was 21 the hoax you gain by hard work and accomplishment like the ambitious young men who make fortunes dealing drugs 22 who cares about the snail darter this is the tired argument about the expendability of endangered species for the sake of economics the has i mean had a long history of conserving nature it was part of our culture in the philippines you can eat dog for a main course if you objected some nice filipino might ask who cares about dogs '' you do because it 's part of your culture who 's right did you see the episode of twilight zone where beings came from another planet with a book how to serve man '' and it turned out to be a cookbook be careful for what you wish for 23 against gay marriage look at canada and the evil consequences it has caused there like low divorce rates low levels of child molestation low incidents of juvenile deliquency etc now check with the moral 24 family values since oedipus you left out your hero reagan in this chapter the only american president to have been divorced 25 speaking as a former fetus i 'd love to read hitler 's or stalin 's version of this 26 the hypocrisy of if you can tell me where i can buy a dvd player made in the i 'll run right out and buy one 27 are immigrants to blame sure they are to blame just blame them they wo n't talk back they could get deported 28 why liberals hate america name three come on you can do it i 'm waiting get back to me later on that one 29 a republican realignment you mean like the way they are lining up to protest stem cell research and praising the war in iraq or maybe the way they 're lining up to get fingerprinted with delay in the lead and libby right behind 30 why conservatives should be cheerful at least one conservative should be you if enough suckers buy your book why would n't you be
i was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book but was disappointed if you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or do n't know how to track trends this book is for you if you are like me you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach i would n't buy the book
denice and i grew up in the same small town in oklahoma it is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death this heinous crime not only shook ada but also shook those of us who grew up with her in purcell ok denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room she was a year behind me in school i recently pulled out a old high school annual looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories memories of a beautiful innocent young woman who 's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye as important as it is that justice has been served in this case it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget denice
was expecting a book that really helps fairly new readers to the concepts of financial engineering this book is not well written and throws the reader into a lot of topics without any practical examples a much much much better book is investment science by luenberger get that book it kicks hull 's ass
what 's wrong with all you amamzon reviewers i actually quite liked shutter island but this was total garbage the morose tone is totally overdone throughout and the end is pathetic the interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story avoid
when i bought the book i did not know that they already made a movie out of it but i learned about it later on so i was really excited when i started to read it also because other comments were really good unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all first the story development is really it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens second several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly the worst part of the book though is its style it does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime gets an extensive characterization most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter but even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter could n't it still be an interesting book unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well the detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages on top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially conclusion if you are a psychologist like character studies this is exactly the right book for you but for those of you who like stories ample twist and turns surprises action thrilling developments elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time please do not come anyway near it watch the movie instead this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours
i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is we 're supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an shortstop in high school the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character
do n't be misled because thomas berry is promoted as a catholic priest many people are falsely led to believe that his books present catholic or christian teaching about the environment instead this book presents a new age blend of religion mixed with if you 're into that you 'll probably like this
do not i repeat do not buy this book brian kilcommons and sarah wilson are both complete idiots we used this book as a reference when we bought our bichon frise what a mistake in the book it states a bichon can be a dog so we bought one bichons are extremely hard to housebreak all the book says is they 'can ' be hard to housebreak this book has cost us hundreds of dollars we ended up giving our dog away tonight because we could not get it potty trained and after further research found out that bichons do not like to be left home alone the book also says that a shih tzu is a nine to five dog but after researching that breed they also do not like to be home alone all day these two authors need to find a different line of work because they are complete idiots when it comes to dogs thanks brian and sarah for writing such a crappy book !
i sure am glad i did not waste my money on this book the author had very few good things to say about any of the breeds this book had so little information on my breed of choice though it was seen on the cover that it was a total waste of my time it almost seemed as though the book was written to turn people off to getting any type of dog at all ! lots of negatives about the breeds not alot of positives alot of generalizations
i 'm a nora roberts fan so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to after reading born in fire '' i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in born in ice '' brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they ca n't create further conflict even if she burns with anger inside she 's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story she thinks she 'll never have what she dreams of she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess she 's always hospitable to her guests she 's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden two places she loves to be although she 's surrounded by folks who love her she 's still lonely and then comes grayson the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland he 's one who lives in the moment ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create the characters compliment each other well they 're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they did n't feel loved she 's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he 's not that 's where the conflict comes to play and that 's kinda where i 've got a problem with the book this is supposed to be a guy who does n't want emotional ties yet early in the book he 's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her there simply was n't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down there was very little if any sexual tension here and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed and even then it seemed like he was n't really fighting himself for being there there simply was n't enough of an inner conflict within him it all seemed like lukewarm resistance and brianna was simply a saint i would have liked to see her emote a little more i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts but i do n't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end i will say that the ending was sweet also it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from born in fire '' i 'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer 's imagination as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect however if you 're looking for a ca n't put down '' romance novel this ai n't it
i really wanted this book to be good it had the right setting ireland the right pairing a skillful woman and a tormented man who is a writer very interesting to me as that 's my profession it also seemed to have the right author nora roberts but these three things did n't gel for me i was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book brianna 's character does n't hold interest grayson is just plain annoying i would have kicked him back out into the rain and not romantic at all none of the romantic spark and unique nature of ireland comes through in this book when nora roberts is on she 's really on when she 's off you get born in quot
this novel was very frustrating for me because i just could not connect with the main character sam i found him attention starved and annoying although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of sam i have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if i ca n't connect to the characters also if you are looking for a happy complete novel i would not recommend this one it will leave you lost and dissatisfied
i know a lot of people have written some really rave reviews about this book but personally think this book sucked out loud the only reason the book could have possibly won the lambda literary award for 2004 is that it must have been the only gay novel released that year the book is filled with poor editing continuity and spelling errors i was actually onboard and ready to forgive all of this until i hit part three of the novel at this point the character of sam becomes so infuriating that if the reader could slap him they should in the beginning of the novel his apparent obsession with clay can be written off as teenage angst and first love '' syndrome when part three rolls around this spirals into a level of obsessive delusion that would warrant the kid being placed on lithium and into long term therapy the fact that the adult characters in the book actually let this dramatic overnight slide as if nothing is wrong shows mastbaum 's inability to ground his book in any form of reality creating a world seemingly devoid of any real consequence the last chapters were very strained and seemed like little more than a mad dash to end the book i wanted to like the book i really did but i just ca n't recommend it to anyone as a good read the back cover bills it as a gay catcher in the rye '' which is a terrible terrible comparison the works of salinger are my particular focus in american literature and a gay catcher this piece is not there are so many more books about similar situations that are just much better
an poorly written portrayal of life on oahu involving a 17 year old gay conflicted surfer and his neurotic obsessive 16 year old hopeful friend this book drags us into the terminally boring life of teenage oahu full of shallow character development cliches plus narrative and dialogue that is painful this book deserves the bottom of the the gay adolescent book pile for those teenagers that resonate with this book and its characters take a very hard look in the mirror if this is life god any god help us all
the scripts are buggy and do n't even work out of the box and they certainly are n't well written enough for a production website the contact email address in them bounces perhaps the author 's gone into hiding in shame on the plus point they do give some ideas on what could be done to improve a site as long as you write your own perl
the programs are not really '' they are not '' programming is required because there are bugs in html documents and scripts that must be corrected the book is a good resource of information for people who want to study and learn and troubleshoot and learn perl because it is possible to get the scripts to work if the troubleshooter does not give up until they get things to work satisfactorily i believe that it is practically impossible for a person to use these scripts without having some experience with perl and cgi and html the book has a lot of good explanations of code which i find helpful and useful i ca n't blame anyone for selling the book in the way it is sold salesmen sell the book programmers who successfully learn do n't give up when things do n't work easily this is book for beginning programmers
this book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold it is terrible it is a lie ! on the back of my book it says jazz up your site with 20 exclusive professional cgi scripts and subroutines no programming required ! '' it is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand perl while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone as it is hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book if you survive through that part of it you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn perl enough to do things in your own way buy another book find another way
myth 1 american women live under patriarchy myth 2 america 's the world 's leading threat to the environment myth 3 america is a racist nation myth 4 the untied states is an imperial power myth 5 the rich get richer the poor get poorer all facts plus the higher the iq the more liberal someone is ben franklin einstein our founding forefathers like thomas jefferson all liberals the lower the iq the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself i love america but changes need to be made rome fell too eventually from bad politics
if you 're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is whatever look elsewhere flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point he relies on for example what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs look at the footnotes in chapter 4. i 'm sorry but this is like looking for a leno 's jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement also in chapter 4 flynn lays out the 5 myths of the left does the left actually believe them as a bleeding heart liberal who knows mostly other bleeding heart liberals i 'll give my response 1 american women live under a patriarchy his point is that women in america are better off than just about anywhere else true but that does n't mean they do n't live under a patriarchy 2 america is the world 's leading threat to the environment his point is that places like russia and china are far worse no one i know disagrees with his point 3 america is a racist nation his point is that we are not i do n't know any liberals who think america is a racist nation 4 the united states is an imperial power as this was published in 2002 i 'll abstain from commenting other than to say that he says the left believes that the international growth of starbucks mcdonalds and such is cultural imperialism i think many liberals would agree with that he says most of the countries embrace these companies opening stores in them i say that does n't mean its not cultural imperialism 5 the rich get richer the poor get poorer his argument is apparently that individuals who were in the lowest 20 of the income bracket in 1979 were mostly not in 1988. he cites and article in the national review where these numbers came from that article sites a treasury department survey so he 's relying on secondary sources for his information looks like shoddy research to me the book is riddled with problems for example on pg 31 he quotes robert altman as saying that we were in a way for afghani oil interests flynn then says that its not clear who altman was referring to or why he would say that about a country without major oil reserves here flynn misses a perfect opportunity to attack a widely held liberal belief that bush attacked afghanistan for a potential pipeline that could be used to get oil out of central asian countries he does n't though he lets it lie this is the nature of my problem with him again and again his attacks are inept or simply untrue reading his summary of why the left hates america is just tripe no one i know thinks like this he says we believe capitalism is a failed economic system i do n't know anyone who believes this personally i believe in universal healthcare but that 's primarily because i 've dealt with hmo 's before he also says the left condemn christianity as intolerant once again no one i know believes this this book is full on nonsense
the book does nothing but make a lie of itself there 's no leftwinger that hates america contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you you ca n't keep complaining about michael moore and dan rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as rush limbaugh and dan flynn folks you can not complain about the left hating america when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing china and other facist and communist nations to control america 's economy and pretty much everything else of it
unless you 're into spamming folks who filter out junk mail anyway you wo n't find much value in this book each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email spam campaign in order to get recognition and thus advertise to the reader
will you learn anything yes dont buy another book like this and waste your money ! every chapter is one ad after another
if something seems too good to be true it usually is that 's the case with this book as well it seems that all of these authors in this book are continualy trying to sell each others products no real practical advice is given they suggest making money by building a huge mailing list and selling products to the reciepient through emails first of all how do we build this magical list and secondly who enjoys receiving spam of any kind these days let 's call a spade a spade the only ones getting rich off this book are the authors
a waste of money and so general that only a abolute beginner can use called expert tips are common knowledge tips for a succesful email 1 be responsive to customers be honest all times have a good mailinglist have a good offer or quality product well well that 's great news this book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling can easly see the book has been made in a few day
stale painfully obvious information from the internet gurus full of '' instead of the more useful '' information if you really must get this type of info go to the authors ' websites it 's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet for beginners in ecommerce there 's very little in the way of detailed instructions for people with more experience there 's nothing new here just a compilation of articles with the author 's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they 're telling you about
i didnt think the book was bad until the further i got i could understand why rose decided to leave california i was glad that she decided to keep the baby even when she married son i thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone including her daughter the fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me i would have loved to see thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that rose touched i almost felt that patchett lost her steam and found it easier to let rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening at the very least i would have liked an explanation from rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal as far as being a saint i didnt see any redeeming quality about rose for that kind of title it was frustrating and disappointing its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth
everyone loves rose the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book her mother loves her her first husband sister evangeline her best friend her second husband and her daughter the only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother 's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family she is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother she says she misses her everyday so why does she never go back to see her before she dies why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her rose 's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly rent a hotel room on the coast sit on the bed for five minutes and drive all night to be home to the husband she does n't love by morning it 's idiotic apparently this episode was so much fun to rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes it was so much fun sounds like a blast she ca n't even carry on a conversation much less show any tenderness or affection it makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at elizabeth 's after she leaves because he misses her so much even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage also sister evangeline confides in cecelia that she misses rose so much she can hardly bear it why she was a humorless inconsiderate to put it mildly bore cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother as she should be but even she accepts her behavior in the end it was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere like rose when she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now i wo n't read bel canto or the magician 's assistant this book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless
this book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste i trust but i 've got to say i just do n't understand its appeal it starts out as mildly intriguing and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear and the narrator of the middle section gardener son is not only too good to be true he 's also deathly boring a drone i 've read bel canto and the patron saint of liars only confirms my belief that ann patchett 's novels are overrated
let 's see ken starr wastes the public money attacking bill clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with mitch mcconnel of ky to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there are n't any already ! ! ! this book is a perfect tool for neconservative nazis to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by and gop with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend clinton but easily caved into and defended bush the !
if you are a cio head of hr or other so called support '' function looking for help on how to align with the business this is not the book for you my suggestion is to skip this book or if you must check it out of the library or buy it used the book you want is kaplan and norton 's first book called the balanced scorecard '' which is very good and is just repeated in this book next i would purchase the hbr article on strategy maps september 2000 those two works cover all of what is in this book and they have a stronger implementation flavor alignment is a persistent issue facing every organization and operating unit with the organization this book does not provide the practical or actionable advice needed to give business leaders the tools and techniques need to make progress in this critical area if you want to know why please read on kaplan and norton are the undisputed masters of issues related to scorecards and their ideas in that area are used by leading organizations everywhere with great success unfortunately as they have tried to expand beyond scorecards there work in this area this book and the organization have not come near the mark in my opinion alignment is a critical issue in today 's dynamic and changing environment unfortunately the authors approach alignment in a very simplistic way create a strategy map then create a scorecard and you will get alignment sorry but just using these two tools do not cut it to handle such a tough issue and this book shows it like the strategy focused organization '' kaplan and norton seek to use case studies to help illustrate their points for that they are to be commended however the case studies they use are very shallow read more like corporate press releases and product testimonials that is a shame and a real weakness of this book as alignment is a complex issue and simply saying 'we sat down created a balanced score card and a strategy map and we were aligned ' does not address the issues nor provide insight for the reader the reason for such a low score on this book is the lack of help it provides the people who most are in need of alignment cios hr and to some extent finance kaplan and norton dedicate chapter 5 to aligning support functions '' and right away you know the mindset they are applying for k and n alignment is a process of completing their deliverables and they treat it hr finance and any other support function as staffed with expert specialists whose culture is quite different from that of managers in line operating units consequently support groups frequently become isolated from the line organization executives of business units accuse them of living in hq based silos and being incapable of responding to local operating needs '' page 120 their solution for it hr and finance alignment puts these organizations back into the 1960 's as they advise these functions to read the business strategy map and scorecard and then create your own separate but not equal scorecard based on the services you can provide that works if all you want it and hr to do is provide basic services but if you want to gain competitive advantage or if you are a cio hr or cfo who wants to link into and align with the business this approach puts you at arms length and something apart kaplan and norton should know better and more importantly i have to believe that there are case studies that do not treat it hr and finance as support functions but integral parts of the business strategy the fact that they could not find these cases where there is one strategy map that the whole company could align around give the impression that they are looking at the issue of alignment with the wrong lens
at 163 pages wildlife '' is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched montana landscape the biggest problem is not so much the story but the way the story is told in some cases the impersonal narrator works as in the great gatsby '' but in others like wildlife '' or a prayer for owen meaney '' the narrator is such a nonentity that they do n't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other more important characters the story if you do n't know is that when narrator joe 's father loses his job as a golf instructor he goes into the forest to help fight a wildfire while he 's gone joe 's mother has a fling with an older local businessman warren miller but whether this was already going on before joe finds out is unclear when joe 's father returns from the fire his mother moves out for a while and that 's it in this case joe complete with dull name has no friends no ambitions and few if any opinions to share he 's no one i could ever care about because his only function seems to be as a recording device to report the activities of his parents to us readers the parents as though aware of this speak in an unnatural way to always indicate to us what they are feeling or thinking it 's the problem i 've had with all of ford 's books including the independence day '' some writers are able to write convincing dialogue and others like ford are not it 's hard to say much about wildlife '' because there 's so little to it there 's not a lot of action drama or passion and the story itself is n't much that we have n't already seen before again the story told through joe the buffer keeps us from really learning anything about the characters and that prevents us from feeling sympathetic towards their plight it 's hard to feel sorry even for poor joe because he 's so without distinguishing features to his personality i 've said this before about similar cases of stories using a bland narrator which always prompts other people to reach for the not helpful '' button and that is that the story would have been more interesting either in focusing on one of the parents or in and focusing on both so that we were n't so buffered from everything what makes ford 's bascombe novels the sportswriter '' and independence day '' so much better than his other novels is that we learn just about everything about frank bascombe and he is the center of all the action of the story so that even if he is emotionally detached it 's easier to feel sympathetic towards him as a reader this ca n't be said for this dry little book if i had n't bought this book for about as little as you can realistically pay without stealing it and if it were longer then i would give it for wasting my time and money but i 'll give it a bonus star for not wasting either one now go reach for the not helpful button i command you
i was never drawn into the story the writing and editing could have been better the distant narrator left me feeling uninvolved and i never felt or cared anything for the characters for a vietnam story that draws the reader in read the proud bastards
that 's how i felt the whole time i was reading this book i loved the sixth sense really liked unbreakable sorta liked signs and hated the village when lady in the water came out i really did n't have any desire to see it however when i saw this book in the library i have to admit that i was intrigued as a writer i 'm always curious as to how others go through the writing process what drives them a peek into a creative mind like shyamalan 's was too much too resist i wish i had others have written that shyamalan comes off as egocentric i did n't get that sense so much he 's a visionary who could n't get everyone to buy into his vision whether or not his vision was one worth pursuing well i think anyone who reads this book or sees the movie will know how to answer that however the problem for me was n't the subject it was the author bamberger was simply not the right person to pen this tale i really do n't know much about the makings of a hollywood blockbuster and apparently neither does bamberger he provides little or no insights throughout the text i think that a good seasoned writer could have done something with this story instead we got pages of nothing special after reading this book i went back and read roger ebert 's review of lady in the water he wrote something in there that was interesting he said the movie was all tell and no show i felt the book was much the same way bamberger continually tries to get away with just telling us the facts as opposed to showing us how the story unfolded as a result the narrative is dry and incredibly uninteresting considering the subject matter all in all i 'd definitely pass on this book
the writing of this book is about as readable as a poor issue of sports illustrated the book tied in with the release of the movie which was a flop and now warners wants their money back so as both a media tie in book and the movie and the film maker who made it everyone came out looking like fools
reading the other reviews i see some people are so admiring of night shyamalan that anything he writes or directs is a work of creative genius no doubt shyamalan is talented but maybe his fame and fortune came too soon to keep his ego in check i know some of the people mentioned in the book and was curious how their interactions with shyamalan would be portrayed shyamalan is his own number one fan and he has no patience for anyone who disagrees with him or critizes his work he has had a few successful movies and believes all studio executives should trust in him completely i was amazed that shyamalan approved of the book since it shows so much of his darker side shyamalan sets his own rules he can feels he has the right to demand a certain salary but then feels betrayed by an actress who asks for more than the sag minimum he has offered her he loves his family yet does n't seem to accept that a film executive can break his rules by placing her family above work the book is worth a read if you are a shyaman fan or wonder what led up to the disaster that became lady in the water there is no doubt that night shyamalan is a rare talent with new ideas it is only his ego that stands in his way of even great succes
icky i like mns a lot i like the things he says in interviews i like his movies i do n't think they are perfect but they speak to me this book while an interesting and easy read is not fun i ca n't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it has n't really publicly commented on it other than to say the author had his full support i do n't know it just seemed a weird portrait of someone it seemed and vanity fair or like confessions of a shopaholic ew i do n't know what mns is really like or if bamberger interpreted things accurately i just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently
bought it for school enjoyed the other books i bought but this one put me to sleep written more for a professional academic or corporate board member i enjoy much more pragmatic books
how many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks knives and mirrors two well koontz takes over a hundred and repeats repeats repeats 500 pages should have been cut from this book repetition weakens writing
this novel started out pretty good in that i did n't know where koontz was going with martie 's panic attacks and fear of herself it seemed to take forever for anything to actually happen the antagonist was a caricature so it was a job getting through each page if this had been my first koontz novel i probably would n't bother with a second
as a student starting law school i thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class boy was wrong the book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student it is however very basic in its approach and gives you a good start so it is not a total the subtitle says that the book is for '' as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun my recomendation is that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer trust me it is well worth the fees among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list in the case of and west law require very expensive memberships and that most law schools restrict the use of their law library to students in their law school and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the law library as the law students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the library and legal librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome
this book is a collection of q a 's where donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems although some generalizations can be made from the problems included it 's hard to know how to generalize whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case this means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog 's behaviour if you have a serious problem do n't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes
now where 's the old john stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses guess he thought it 's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice for all his ramblings in this book he might as well blabber on the emmy awards and get lost ! let 's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds
for all the talk stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at abc the only reason stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior for all that he claimed to expose it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt
of course stossel can talk big about busting them liberals '' but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them ever wonder why abc hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths ever wonder why stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks this and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad
first he says he cracked down on all those liberals '' but yet he admits to loving their evil ways if this is as wishy washy as he can get no wonder he and sam donaldson get along ! you ca n't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same liberal media '' if he were working as a farmer in idaho for instance he 'd have more credibility but i 'm not so sure stossel says what he means
it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat then do n't waste your time jo
just not funny i returned the book and got my money back
i agree with one the comments posted below the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him over the course of the book he does n't change he 's unsympathetic and by the time we 've reached page 500 we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. i found myself dying to get to the end of this book just so i could start another book with some substance and some characters another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way overall i thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time
so poor brooke shields felt unhappy so what is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year and all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself of all the times in one 's life the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby yet still she could n't feel her own baby 's love for her how pathetic i think she 'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash and she realised she could die any moment people get 'depressed ' because they spend too much time thinking and thinking about themselves do n't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so she should read stop thinking and start living ''
i 've heard good things about this book so i was honestly expecting to like it however i really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive and because it was written by brooke shields the book sold but really if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere i also got the feeling that because brooke shields suffered ppd she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it i 'm sorry but i do n't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much there are unfortunately millions of people who are poor without health insurance and worse without support of family and friends that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness no one cares about them that is the saddest fact about depression in this country however brooke shields had millions of dollars to pay for help a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it a career that people would die for her lack of talent does n't seem to have affected her career much and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out she also had a doctor calling her every day which i 've never heard of before ! try being without all those things when you 're suffering depression trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather i was a bit annoyed that brooke shields was oblivious to all this in her book and tom cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications i admire tom cruise he is certainly far more talented than brooke and i believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything however he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about ! ! ! ! the book 's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author so it 's hard to get much out of it this book only sold because it was about brooke shields
i was going to assign this book to my students in my abnormal psychology class the first chapter is powerful and true however this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children 's illnesses ! ! ! ! he also attacks nami the national association of the mentally ill an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life and has truly educated more people about mental illness than breggin has ever done himself i am sure the good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are in my opinion obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents attacks i believe that may be a result of his psychoanalytical training
having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years i can assure those who swallow breggin 's nonsense hook line and sinker that nobody could have talked '' me back to anything resembling health '' the mental anguish i suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long financial and insurance considerations aside talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results no doubt pharmaceutical companies often drive treatment trends in a highly questionable manner both via perks to and the increasingly obnoxious practice of direct advertising of prescription drugs to the public nevertheless meds and sleep aids help relieve the suffering quickly which is what medicine should be all about not ideology only one of breggin 's points is valid and that is the disturbing trend for nearly all to focus on to the exclusion of psychotherapy the current treatment model has the patient seeing a psychiatrist for meds management typically quarterly while also seeing a psychologist for psychotherapy anywhere from weekly to monthly it would seem that one stop shopping '' would not only make things more convenient for patients but competence in multiple therapies would also make for a more effective and insightful professional use meds to stablize the patient and minimize the suffering then pursue cognitive and other talk therapies to provide coping skills and attack the environmental and experiential contributors to the disease
do any of you positive reviewer even know that '' breggin does n't even see patients anymore that in nearly 2 years all he has done has traveled the country to testify in courts against psychiatrists that is in states which have n't yet discredited him for being biased and unscientific i find it amazing that a man who has n't treated a psychiatrist patient in years can write a book so skewed and wrong that it can endanged the public and still be published what bothers me more is that people think he 's correct modern medicine does not know the reason that the pancreas produces less insulin than normal they only know that it does so maybe diabetics should stop taking insulin and try to figure out if they were raised improperly by their mothers sound crazy of course but this is the message that he 's advocating he should be ashamed of himself he is not a real doctor and should return his diploma edit about misunderstanding karellen 's comments above are typical of those attacking something they know little about making me wonder if karellen believes in aliens like tom cruise i said nothing about when the book was written and that is irrelevant to the point of the review which is that breggin 's opinions are so biased that he has been discredited by state courts in this country i was trying to avoid posting websites but since you posted one i 'll post one too http
as a behavioural neuroscientist i was appalled by the extreme and unscientific rhetoric expressed by this individual the nature of this read provides an extremely biased by throwing psychiatric techniques at the reader that are either or have been changed to better the patient s involved a mental state is a direct result of a particular brain state and therefore a disturbed continual mental state creating dysfunction in the individual must be a result of altered neurochemicals and must be corrected through proper medications if the author knew anything of neuroscience and psychiatry he would understand that medications and psychotherapy are the best combination and not one alone
first let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail he does not he hikes less than a third you dont find this out until through the book which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad to an ill effort to fulfill a contract my conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher could not and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics as others have said in this review forum this book can be snide highschoolish and down right mean i fail to see the wit '' in his endless negitivity and bashing this book has a few funny parts but i cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments it is so unbelievible in places that you know you are on an imagined tangent dont waste your money or time i am so happy i bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale !
stockwell was right on in his review bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself his favorite targets are southern whites a typical description is loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex '' ! ! ! how would a reviewer of the nyt for example respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes youths as crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman '' neither of these passages are acceptable but bryson belongs to that ilk who 's motto is bigotry for me but not for thee '' bytw his earlier book lost continent '' is even more egregious with his kind of it 's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff
this book wo n't turn me off to jp who i admire very much for his style of cooking and pleasant personality but the book was a bit boring once i gleaned the book my usual how can i decide what to cook first '' did n't hit me i picked up the book again with the same results just not enough inspiring stuff there i have n't looked at the book since so i ca n't even say this or that recipe was lackluster i only remember my response to the book it wa n't the 'fast food ' concept either because everyone needs quick recipes in the cooking repertoire i cook a lot i 'm not a cookbook collector my cookbooks are stained and tattered i 'm afraid fast food my way '' will remain in pristine condition until i can give it to someone who will assign it more value than i can each book i have on the shelf has to carry its weight or it 's off to the pantry my culinary siberia for cookbooks where this cookbook now resides for some reason i found jp cooking from this book on tv much more pleasurable than entertaining the idea of cooking from this cookbook
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of you n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel pick up the elegant naval institute press edition in a modern complete updated translation with commentary by the leading american verne expert today walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by margot president najvs
there are a few interesting nuggest in the first few pages and then story after story after story there 's no doubt that their agency is successful but please present some principles and not story after story after
i had to read this book for school i thought i would love it but it turns out i was wrong this book was mind numbing it is drawn out and boring i almost threw the book away and rented the movie i should have this books sucks do n't waste your time reading it

randolph rand duchay and troy turner both age thirteen kidnap and kill a girl after trying to get her to puff on a cigarette and drink some beer big surprise she gagged cried and fussed psychologist alex delaware was asked by the judge to evaluate each kid and submit his opinion to the judge as to whether they should be tried as juveniles or adults they 're tried and sent off to separate youth detention centers troy is dead six weeks later rand gets out at age 20 and is dead three days later however hours before his death he called delaware asking to meet with him alex and his police friend homicide detective milo sturgis begin investigating rand 's murder the investigation leads them to all sorts of crazy people relationships and situations i 've enjoyed k 's past books but lately he seems to be avoiding the suspense factor in his stories this book leaves a few loose ends and alex 's love life up in the air
this was my first reading of a kellerman novel though i 'd obviously heard about him for years i ca n't imagine a read much more painful than this novel he is the king of what writers call talking heads just pages and pages of dialogue that go nowhere he also loves convenience an absolute deal killer in mystery and suspense the characters delaware interviews protest for a few sentences then suddenly realize they better help him and then there are the pages and pages and pages where he and milo have to have impossibly mundane dialogue so the author can tell you how the mystery is unfolding because nothing in the material leads to any mystery of merit it 's also amazing that kellerman is a psychologist and his character is one as well and yet so often it is other characters pointing out what even amateur phsychologists or observers of human beings would know if this is as the jacket says one of the world 's most popular authors '' i need to go in search of the worst sellers
i wish i could give this zero stars it is a very dark book and i ca n't imagine why anyone would write publish gift it or read it there is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk garbage in garbage out !
i have read many books on wwii from many perspectives and have been to visit the beaches four times i can not visit the american graves in normandy without being moved twice i have had the experience of hearing taps played near omaha beach i have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died i had high expectations for the book my problem is that the book never finds its voice at times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men i wanted to hear more from this man just as he starts to share the general leaps in and throws off the narrative let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different a few photos and maps would be nice if the general needs to talk give him a separate chapter at the end of the book we hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels their voices could add to the history i wish the colonel would have spoken for them
i was thinking negative thoughts waiting for the book to advise me on positive thoughts
i did not even finish this ! ! i have no idea what this book was trying to get across i give bono credit for the hard work he is doing for aids but i do not understand where or what this conversation was all about sorry bono i am a big fan of your music but this book was so confusing and not at all enlightening
this book covers much of the same ground that clayton christensen explored in his three revolutionary books the innovator 's dilemma the innovator 's solution and seeing what 's next truthfully those books do a far superior job of explaining the dynamics of innovation in comparison to the performance of this book utterback does have very insightful comments on the standardization of product design but outside of that section the book is not particularly exemplary for those interested in mastering the art of innovation the game begins and ends with clayton christensen
the author should be sued for deception the biggest blunder i 've ever made was buying this book
because i have ! in his book on acc basketball in some cases he did n't change a word repeated the same anecdotes i am really glad that i did n't pay for this book because i would have been really angry about old material if you like reading about acc basketball and you have n't read feinstein 's verrrry similar book you will probably like it if you like reading about big east basketball when you 're not reading about acc basketball you might like it if you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the acc the big east and feinstein 's apparent obsession with bob knight save your money for another book it 's too bad really feinstein is a good writer i guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards
i 've only read the first 70 pages or so but agree with others that this is repetitious you better love the acc because it 's mostly about those teams and ucla and the errors clearly the author was trying to churn out two books at once the other being on the nfl ravens and it shows 1 coach krybaby is his '' introduction says scott may broke his leg at indiana and that cost them the national championship in 1975. and k was an assistant to bobby knight well actually may broke his arm against purdue in february 1975. arm leg what 's the difference right 2 author says michigan state beat penn by 32 in the 1979 semis actually it was 34 points and penn had beaten unc earlier and unc had beaten msu by 1 early in the regular season when magic johnson as dean smith points out in the book had eight turnovers that 's all well and good but the latter game also was infamous for when one of the tar heel radio guys said magic johnson is no phil ford '' and msu fans could n't agree more ai n't that the truth ! ! ! all in all this book is highly disappointing a effort at best
de soto 's work was viewed by economists historians and politicians alike as breakthrough he gives us an look at the lima 's informal sector and postulates much to the satisfaction of his washington bankroll that peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market capitalism unfortunately he has twisted peru 's real scenario to reflect what washington wants to hear in reality lima 's informal sector is merely a way for a depraved population to survive not a radical shift toward capitalism de soto 's institue for liberty and democracy was funded almost in full by washington and the man himself has spent more time in the than in peru this book leans more toward american propaganda than objective analysis an interesting read but only with abundant grains of salt
this was a waste of money i bought wolters gun dog afterwards and it made this video look even worse if you are interested in this video let me know and i will send it to you for free
this book was written i bet by unpaid graduate assistants i borrowed it from the library to read before mr fukuyama 's arrival to speak at a university the book was written to order '' to appeal to american conservatives if mr fukuyama had really wanted to write about the of trust he could not have pointedly ignored the european union nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that 's an exercise in trust building i asked mr fukuyama why as the book does n't have america in the title did he only mention distrust in medieval italy and not the phenominal trust required to bring germans brits and the french together his reply oh people always want me to talk about their country next question '' well ! i feel that this book is a dis service to americans because as with so many and economic books from the usa what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many americans and esp uncrital conservatives i am of course by my own reckoning a conservative a mixed economy democratic christian from the ok ok new labour so i am not hostile to the us but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me good luck america and please read wider and travel
fukuyama trots out stereotypes that he must have picked up at his father 's knee under a thick veneer of impenetrable sociological jargon that can fool the occasional reader into believing that this is an impartial scientist at work like all stereotypes fukuyama 's are a blend of breathtaking overgeneralizations and huge blind spots and like all stereotypes they are utter nonsense the book attempts to update max weber 's protestant ethic '' story to include some societies the basic argument of the book is that catholics are unable to trust people outside their immediate family and so unable to form associations that are not based on family ties the same is true of the chinese claims fukuyama these are the catholics of the orient the japanese and protestants are able to transcend family ties and therefore form a vast range of associations that do not have a genetic basis especially large professionally managed corporations the feckless catholics and chinese however are doomed to form business enterprises that can never be more than mom and pop operations fukuyama therefore has a gloomy prognosis for the economic miracles of china or taiwan or singapore however brilliant a businessman pop may be sooner or later descendants like paris hilton will be running the show there is an interesting chapter on korea where fukuyama is at pains to show that however like wannabe korean business organizations may seem they are really at heart the book 's thesis is obvious nonsense dramatic exist such as the chinese communist party or the jesuits also the broad idea that catholicism or contributes to poverty lacks a statistical basis i saw a recent article about thousands of japanese orphans in china who were taken in and looked after by chinese families after japan 's world war ii defeat rather surprising behavior in this '' society ! perhaps these chinese had been somewhat civilized by the ways of the occupying japanese
kofi annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that kofi annan the peacekeeper is ironic in that annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the un support for arafar etc jeff jacoby recently wrote that he is basically a symptom of un 's sickness jacoby noted that just last week annan woke up to a wall street journal column by glenn harlan reynolds publisher of the influential instapundit website urging that he be replaced by vaclav havel the former president of the czech republic in the new york times eminence william safire reviewed the revelations that link the massive scandal to annan 's own family until this year his son kojo was getting monthly payments from a firm that had a major contract with the un even though he 'd left the company in 1998. the corruption enveloping the un will not begin to dissipate safire wrote until annan resigns having through initial ineptitude and final obstructionism brought dishonor on the secretariat of the united nations '' meanwhile the latest national review was out with its cover photo of annan and the headline in large red letters you 're fired ! '' an editorial inside insisted that annan should either resign if he is honorable or be removed if he is not '' while an essay by nile gardiner a former aide to british prime minister margaret thatcher explained why kofi 's hour is up '' with his record gardiner observed if annan were the ceo of a fortune 500 company he would have been forced to resign months ago '' on wednesday came another call for annan 's ouster this one from the chairman of the senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations which has amassed evidence that saddam hussein used stolen dollars to underwrite terrorism and suborn at least one senior un official it is abundantly clear '' that kofi annan should resign senator norm coleman said as long as annan remains in charge the world will never be able to learn the full extent of the bribes kickbacks and payments that took place under the un 's collective nose '' but odds are the world wo n't much care about getting to the bottom of the latest un scandal un scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage there was no global uproar when the brutal regime in libya was chosen to chair the un 's human rights commission nothing happened to the un after its troops allowed serbs to slaughter muslim men and boys in the safe haven '' of srebrenica sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the un goes the latest involves charges of rape child abuse and prostitution by un personnel in the congo but they never cause heads to roll in turtle bay annan himself became secretary general despite his failure when he headed the un 's peacekeeping operations to pay attention to warnings of genocide in rwanda why should anything be different this time may be the greatest international of modern times it may have strengthened one of the world 's bloodiest dictators but if history is any guide the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does by week 's end in fact dozens of governments including all the permanent members of the security council save the united states had publicly rallied to annan 's support scandal or no scandal he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term which is just as well annan is merely a symptom of the un 's sickness not the cause of it his resignation would do nothing to reform the un into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned better that annan remain in place as a symbol of un fecklessness and failure and a spur to those who can envision something better the un is a corrupt institution one that long ago squandered whatever moral legitimacy it had the un 's founding documents venerate justice and human rights but for the past 40 years the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states essentially the third world most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights inside the united nations there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy each gets exactly one vote in the general assembly the reason the un indulges vicious regimes like those in north korea syria and cuba is that they are members in good standing and most other governments lack the courage to cross them the un can not be fixed unless that changes and that is n't going to change kofi is a bad man
plain truth set in lancaster county pennsylvania would be better entitled fancy lies an plain woman wakes up with labor pains gives birth in a calving pen cuts the umbilical cord and prays lord please make this go away '' when she awakens and the baby is no longer with her she whispers denke '' and goes on with her day later after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate she tells them i did n't have a baby '' as blood trickles down her leg without providing spoilers two of many implausible situations follow first two women one old one young both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse defying the odds of fertility second a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an farm out of the kindness of her heart in summary a italicized section along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages those interested in reading just one book by jodi picoult should choose my sister 's keeper chris bohjalian 's midwives is better
i will not be passing it on to a friend the ending left me irritated why should i close a book with questions in my head i will not buy another picoult book i felt snookered '' by keeping faith and now i have been fooled twice i have to say i did enjoy the book up until the ending but the hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and i was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that ellie had short hair why did n't i know that before obviously the characters would have benefited from better descriptions
the writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense i thought something might change that it might become an interesting ghost story or there might be moral issues or maybe even a character would grow or change the ending is perhaps intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones but that 's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness are we supposed to take everything that ellie says about the amish in court peaceful gentle incapable of murder loving willing to accept an child into the community as lies the ending belongs to a much darker book my biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing i kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story
this was my first time reading a jodi picoult book and i really do n't think i will attempt another one the plain truth was painfully long boring and repetitive every character was annoying and unbelievable especially ellie and katie the main two i kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of hannah but it never came just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in the beginning is the only part of the book i found interesting went downhill extremely slowly after that
after reading five of her novels i have become a fan of jodi picoult i will admit and this probably proves that i am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself that i 've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that did n't make it on the list initially i liked the book and it kept me reading though maybe just out of habit i enjoyed reading about the amish way of life and the amish traditions though it did make me think of that harrison ford movie witness circa 1989 or something i like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way i like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer that being said she does n't explore this as well as she could we sort of forget that ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted rape she can defend but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney something about the book bothered me maybe i am reading too many of her books too fast but i am seeing a formula here many of her plots include a court room drama all of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one mothers and their powerful all encompassing love for their children are a theme in all of her books i 've read there is usually a twist '' at the end she 's becoming koontz like in her formulaic predictability and i stopped reading his novels as a teenager most of her books left me content like i 'd eaten a good hearty meal however this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction so i was unimpressed with the twist '' at the end of this one i knew whodunit '' about of the way through i was getting bored with that part of the story the red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that katie did n't do it were there from the beginning she should 've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about just because we the readers knew did n't mean that ellie had to know or anyone else for that matter the characters in this novel were a tad generic i am sorry i like her but they were boring for instance i was bored with ellie 's dilemma over coop to the point where i often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together duh i knew they were going to get together after a little drama from ellie through which coop being the quintessential sensitive ponytail guy '' would wait albeit in pain it was just too predictable hannah 's ghost she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and i was a disappointed to see another one but other than that hannah 's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition is it to suggest that she katie might be crazy and a murderer is it to explain why she was so drawn to adam katie being the good amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister in a book that is so amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel maybe hannah 's ghost killed katie 's baby or hid it i liked the details the amish and their daily lives those who assimilate and those who do n't and how the religion and way of life affect one 's thinking offers a neat insight into a different culture i liked the culture clashes and i wondered how they would be resolved but what i did like does n't measure against my dissatisfaction my most recent book purchase included three works of fiction two by picoult and one by atwood i think i 'll shelve the unread picoult for a while i 'll have some time to forget her modus operandi i 'll read the atwood and then i 'll buy a book by a different author
the relationships between the various characters were n't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character lottie at all the book seemed to ramble on and did n't catch my interest there were a few parts where the action picks up but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
all the characters in this book were shallow selfish and boring the writing was good but i could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters
this is my nora roberts book i 've read the first 2 in the 3 sisters trilogy and decided to read chesapeake blue while i very eagerly await face the fire in the mail perhaps i was spoiled by the characters the conflicts and the love stories in 3 sisters but this book pales in comparison the quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter sort of like heaven meets a beer commercial anyways seth is supremely talented handsome kind and sizzling in the sack in other words a stock nora roberts male character alas he is also entirely vain and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his problem '' which he only exacerbates over the course of the book so he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of what her leaking a story to the press which once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her would be about 2 sentences long and he ca n't tell his troubles to his family that he loves so '' much i mean i would n't tell cam anything myself because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love but anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat finally drusilla first the name makes her sound like a villian in a disney movie second she is flat as a pancake and i would pay for problems like hers at the very end she exhibits a spark of life and sort of morphs into another stock nora roberts stock character the sassy smart gal who steps up to defend her man which i like that character in my limited experience nora roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly but her male friendships need a few less and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion and i agree with the other reviewers who wanted seth to end up with aubrey
i 'm embarassed that i read this all the way through the passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff i do n't live with people who talk like that and i do n't understand the purpose sophistication '' to my mind the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with
i more or less forced myself to read the entire book because there were some great anecdotes and also several nodes of connectivity where someone famous first got their start working with some of the other persons mentioned in its pages but the factual detail and the amount of time spent on uninteresting background and financial dealings made for slow reading i really was n't all that interested in the various ownership deals between the principals of the story too much blah blah blah and not enough sizzle by the second half of the book i was skimming the pages trying to find interesting to keep me engaged i 'm donating this along with a bunch of other books that i 've read to a local shelter
let me see if i have got this right the only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way that way we all gain ok the bosses of nike mcdonalds and will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide sounds good who would want to be the party pooper ! well someone 's got to be and for the simple reason that we do n't live on a planet the size of jupiter the oil 's finite we know that but ca n't be bothered to act on it even the supply of water is turning out to be finite the south east of england is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water ok they could ship it in from the rest of the uk where there 's no problem but for reasons that do n't quite add up that 's not possible it 's not the corporate solution if you will forgive the pun has it occurred to anyone i wonder if it 's growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems yes i know marx and stalin do n't offer any fixes but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced growth is going to whether we like it or not
de soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights it 's incredibly difficult for poor people specifically recent urban migrants to get legal title to their land as a result the poor make extralegal '' arrangements squatting on and using land that neighbors but not the government recognize as theirs but because they do n't own the land they ca n't get a mortgage on their house to start a business electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services the government has difficulty taxing them because they do n't have a legal address and so on and so on it 's a very important point but de soto oversells arguing with exaggerated and ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor he occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work for example he has helped businesses in peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes a useful bit of empirical information but those gems appear all too occasionally before reading this entire book i recommend going to the website of de soto 's foundation the institute for liberty and democracy at and reading the main point there in one tenth the words
a much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story the end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
i truly expected more from this but from beginning to end it seemed trite unconvincing and entirely too derivative the characters fall flat and the writing is simplistic at least it is short
this is my first book by this author and i honestly feel like i might like the story if the author did n't ruin all the punchlines in the book the fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like i was being beat over the head with a did you get it '' stick i also thought he was the fairytale theme with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks
wolfe hero worships the irish and all others rank below them the irish detective martin das fitzgibbon and caughey can do no wrong the italians jews and wasps have their good points but are flawed in one way or another at the bottom are the dark people '' as wolfe constantly calls them who have created a great dark hole in our society there is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior granted it 's an entertaining read but do n't be fooled
i did n't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when i read it and i do n't understand it any better today a lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties but that was only a tiny part of the novel stick to liar 's poker or bombardiers for a better look most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story there is not a single sympathetic character so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people not only are they they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions the young energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene the smart tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high other characters are just caricatures the overzealous activist the arrogant cop etc i seem to be in the minority but i thought this book was dismal tom wolfe should stick to which he does well
this book is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense it contains endless statements making no sense i was truly looking forward to a book that would be a refreshing alternative to most that 's on the market instead i got a text that was written by someone who could n't think it was full of illogical unsupported statements and arguments if i could i would demand my money back i 'm that upset with my definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has any ability to think whatsoever
while the writing was acceptable i felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced the differnce between the classes is too obvious the contrast between the rich world the students in the wilcox school and the cornhills and the streets of london and isa 's forced marriage to the grocer and cornhill 's predictable and obvious snobbery was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice i was left cold by the overall plot one thing that truly bothered me was the fate of cornhill and isa i felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired and was not in true bronte style the characters and their development also left something to be desired they were too predictable at times and ellin was just annoying there were few occasions when i sympathized with any character other than isa and only at certain points in the plot there was nothing spectacular about this novel though i wo n't discourage anyone from reading it it was fast paced and it did hold my interest
having read and enjoyed the author 's young adult book hoot and looking for a light adult read i picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light frankly it was both of thos things but within a hundred pages it became eminently easy to put down i enoy a diversion reading book periodically and have some adult writers that meet those needs thomas perry and harold adams to name two this one did n't make it for me it seemed to be a lot of given a hurricane one darn thing after another for a group of characters i did n't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together
the kite runner gets off to such a good start with its blend of history observations about daily life in kaboul and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up stay focused and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i found the parts of the book about the flexbility of identity and race interesting the boy liquidly moves through the novel adapting to new classes races and environments he demonstrates the poignant struggle to be oneself and part of one 's culture and the simultaneous desire to be other '' however this is fixated on sex the boy 's life seems to revolve around sex more than the aforementioned issues and the discussions about sex have absolutely no reason to be in the novel in fact it draws away from the momentum there are parts where the narrator is describing a person in an insightful and interesting way but then throws in a comment about the man 's pulsating bulge '' or something equally ridiculous i do n't have problems with sexuality or sexual novels but it had absolutely no point in this book and drew away from the central issues of class and race and you 'll notice to book is heavily discounted
i am not one who ca n't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance however after half of this book i had to toss it away because there was nothing redeeming about it every character we encounter is wicked and sexually deranged i need a shred of hope to contine reading especially if i am to endure such explicit rape scenes ugh
stoner begins by warning that unscientific books written by christians bring discredit upon christianity and drive away from the gospel unfortunately following this thinking stoner may be a major culprit he simply accepts standard uniformitarian thinking as fact his treatment of dating methods appears to show a complete misunderstanding of them he says for instance that the circular reasoning of using fossils is obviated by the fact that fossils are used for dating only when they first have been shown to agree with isotopic dates first of all index fossils and the concepts behind using them were used for over a century before isotopic dating even existed second one of the major ways that dating results are evaluated for presumed reliability is their agreement with relative dating based on index fossils consequently the circular reasoning still stands
readers interested in benny morris should read israeli historian yehoshua porath 's war and remembrance '' in the summer 2002 issue of azure porath adds to the 1995 and april 1990 discussions by robert satloff and shabtai teveth in middle eastern studies and to efraim karsh 's excellent book fabricating israeli history do n't read this book without looking at these critiques why morris et al tell readers they have written new '' history of israel considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the zionist cause here morris considers jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948 and why the arabs fled morris claims to be the first person to have looked at israeli archives on the dalet plan a plan to move populations in certain areas nevertheless other scholars show that morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts firstly yigael alon and israel galili in the book of the palmah gave walid khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the dalet plan was the master plan of the zionists '' to expell palestinians wholesale furthermore the 1973 history of the hagana by uri millstein included the entire dalet plan text official or not these 1959 and 1973 israeli jewish histories very shortly after the the 1948 war did not hide what happened as morris claims here morris also writes that arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the conflict before him he writes that he relied on israeli and western archives but porath karsh satloff and teveth all show that this is not the case furthermore morris did no research at the hagannah archives or those of the idf a fact underlined by efraim karsh in 2002 and one which he admits in a more recent book the war for palestine morris now writes that in the mid both those archives were closed to all researchers after all he writes he was limited to few military materials indicating that there is no new '' research here at all morris ' charge that israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the palestinian arabs is n't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid on the contrary morris takes material very selectively from israeli archive fringes and makes what porath terms outrageoulsy false claims '' that israel 's victory resulted from an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms '' indeed morris writes here that arabs left israel because of many factors their departure was not the fault of the jewish people alone then he contradicts himself giving those who hate israel grounds to blame israel for the exodus without considering the other circumstances this book also details a massacre '' in 1948 of arabs at the village of deir yassin but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle in which most arabs killed like those in jenin in march and april 2002 were armed finally morris does not note by comparison other massacres in 1948 of jews by arabs on december 30 1947 for example arabs murdered some 50 jewish at the haifa refinery on april 13 1948 they massacred over 80 jewish doctors nurses and hebrew university workers on mount scopus in jerusalem additionally nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the etzion bloc were also murdered by palestinian arabs only two survived these latter arab massacres of jews do not fit the blame that morris seeks to lay at jewish feet nor does the fact that jews did not afterwards flee as occurred on the arab side following the battle at deir yassin so morris omits them i also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million jewish refugees from 22 arab nations who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs and rebuilt their lives in israel the and europe the number of jewish refugees was actually larger than that of arab refugees counting only those who fled not their descendants honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war alyssa lappe
this book has been replaced with better more accurate information free of the far slant of morris i suggest uri dan 's excellent four volume set 'israel 's war of independence ' which is far more detailed and accurate than this book
wow i wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of no stars o'reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it fiction is clearly not his strong suit his characters were cardboard cutouts his dialogue stilted and ludicris his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy 's mind really is if this trash is any indication of o'reilly 's true worldview he 's a sick sad man indeed
i 'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored i am no fan of bill o'reilly and this novel is not the greatest but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions especially if from the looks of some of these reviews a reviewer have not actually read this book we need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits re a previous reviewer 's statement that under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko '' the character in question was a villain who briefly appeared a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a when the cop apprehended him in fact o'reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story obviously he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene '' that 's the main problem with the novel he does n't understand how a story is told and it does n't appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes he interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty '' you get the picture the details are not horribly original but nothing is stolen outright that i can pinpoint and some scenes and subplots were actually funny i have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice there is nothing gratuitous or intentionally in this book it is just mediocre but i did stick with it to the very end if you like mysteries or o'reilly check it out of the library like i did fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time
i 'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews did n't actually stoop so low as to buy the book i read a few pages of it and this is truly grade level writing i did n't realize that bill 's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was interesting rather than just blatantly and sickeningly arrogant bill should stick to repetitive i know better '' conservative babble it gives us something to make fun of
bill o'reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from twilight zone his vision reminds me of manhunter '' the michael mann film not the lame book he based it on o'reilly tall and deformed is the o'reilly is
bill o'reilly ought to stick to what he does best making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon
i 've heard this book on tape which poor writing aside is more horrifying to actually hear o'reilly read in his own voice the gratuitous sex which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels is enough to turn anyone off but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure a sad sad example of narcissism at it 's very worst
this insight into tv journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent 's vacation to florida o'reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction or a work of anything for that matter and his main character tommy o'malley was n't he one of the aristocats about as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers which someone ought to whack o'reilly in the groin with to sum up in a forthright manner this book sucks i should have seen it coming when my bid for eight dollars on ebay was the only bid for five days and turned out to be the winning bid though winning '' is hardly the term i 'd use after listening to this piece of garbage since o'reilly 's a fan of torture he ought to donate this audio cd for use in interrogating prisoners if the geneva convention will allow it
this book might be a lot more helpful if it were updated regularly the current third edition is from 1986 which is ludicrous with subject matter this volatile the content itself is a bit too brief but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last years
this book was not enlighting alot of the information was out date the phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc
pretentious and boring too clever for its own good the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ and there 's not enough of that and this was the michael glenny translation
the alternate title of this book should have been how to affect an air of sophistication and urbanity in several hundred pages of plodding and frankly unbelievable plotting coupled with two dimensional stereotypes so predictable in their pretentious musings '' an overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors i had hopes for these two having started with cabinet of curiosities '' their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but i retained hope for latent talent then this this conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the i am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of preston and child and perhaps the worst offender of all dan brown
the other reviewers will tell you about the book i 've read most of preston and child 's works including the other two books in this trilogy and they are a good read what gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism i guess it 's a necessity to get published today but you 'd think that at least some male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published i guess most people will sell their souls for money just about all the men in p and l 's books are either wimps effiminate weak bumbling stupid or liars or murderers scared of their own shadows and thoroughly unlikable even pendergast has his moments the women of course are without exception tough brilliant shrewd fearless always right on the rise to the top always outsmarting the men able to knock out a 7 foot 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck forgive the slight hyperbole totally unfeminine and just as unlikeable as the men the stories are very good it 's unfortunate preston and child could n't have come up with better more realisticly human less insulting characters this slop may play in new york and california but in texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women so this is just a warning if you 're a man and those of you who are know what i mean you 'll get sick of the characters in these books
this book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if james frey did not repeat himself a million times although the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive this book however did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox he could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out even though his tactic was to show how brave he was the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind ! this book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late like it almost was for james it was just an okay book and we hope james frey 's next book will be much more interesting
i think if you 've lived life under a rock watched a lot of soap operas and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas this book will appeal to you it makes me angry to read this book not because it 's fiction and i 'll call it completely fictitious garbage but because james frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction ! he writes this book with an underlying tone i 'm better than all of you '' not because he thinks aa is bs but because this theme runs throughout his book in so many situations that after awhile it becomes laughable ! he prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain except his tough guy friends '' i ask you if leonard has such a reputation where 's his protection people would be after him in such a vulnerable read no security place like rehab i think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its bs by feeling its predictability it reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people yeah he 's got problems but he 'll prevail because he 's james frey ! no thank you i absolutely hated this book but i read it so i at least deserve credit for trying
i 'd heard the buzz both pro and con and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him lies are what enable slips '' and enabling '' and denial '' and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure recovery is nearly impossible without honesty so can we look at this man 's memoir '' and expect it to offer anything of value it 's poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic even if oprah had n't exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers '' like frey 's account of the drug house visit in which he rescues '' lilly other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and i ca n't improve on that suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept like a joke of some kind i 'm not laughing
it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read i read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about the writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read i ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over i know this is supposed to be for emphasis but i just found it indulgent the lack of correct punctuation was distracting too had i read this when the book first came out before everyone knew he lied i would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of aa although i have not attended aa or any similar support groups i feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own which in most cases i am sure they are not i found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than james frey and i ca n't say that i felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself i am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he is n't feeling so badly anymore
out of fairness i should tell you that i did n't listen to the whole audiobook i got about way though the first cd and just could n't stand it anymore what i heard was boring and extremely slow moving it 's read like a see spot run '' story for children which makes the boring storyline even more boring and i found it to be a bit insulting i think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting maybe it gets better as it goes along but i am not willing to endure any more to find out
the authors of this book are concerned americans are n't doing what they should specifically to paraphrase former president bill clinton they 're not spending their money right they value things they should n't they work too much they own too much they shop at evil big box stores like so with paternalistic concern in their hearts they have written this book to warn us that we 're in need of a correction the enemies they identify read like a laundry list of the left 's archetypal villians wealthy merchants credit card companies and of course ronald reagan along the way they disparage virtually every technological and economic innovation that has occured over the last 25 years particularly sickening is the warm fuzzy picture they paint of the good old days '' when most americans bought their goods from locally owned stores i grew up in a town identical to the one they idolize in this book it sucked all of the stores were located around the downtown square they closed at six o'clock or earlier wednesdays most did n't open at all sunday was dead parking was extremely limited lack of selection forced consumers to go from one shop to another often in blistering summer heat or freezing winter temperatures prices were high and selection limited especially bitter are the memories i have of trying to find work in these businesses while in high school virtually all the owners had their kids filling what few jobs existed being from a family i desperately needed to work to help my family out but i was unable to find anything in the stagnant local economy then one day a came to town my mom took me there on a bright saturday morning she was ecstatic here at last was a wide variety of goods she could afford she did n't have to hurry to get there before the store closed at dinner time as for me i landed a position with the store which allowed me to contribute to the family income as well as save for college writers of books like this one love to talk about how merchandisers like steamroll '' over main street stores like do n't put guns to anyone 's head to gain them as customers rather the local people look at main street with its inflated prices inconvenient hours and parking and limited selection and then at the new home depot or whatever and freely choose how to best spend their money in other words they control the way their community works and no one seems to mind except for a handful of elitists living in faraway places who are upset that people would rather spend less of their money than live the rest of their lives in a norman rockwell painting but i 've saved the worst for last after wringing their hands for a couple hundred pages over the current state of prosperity in this country the authors outline their plan for recovery '' guess what it consists of bingo ! higher taxes and more government control they even pull that tired old cliche out of their rectums we must protect the children '' not from sexual predators or terrorists but from the local mall my response to this 300 or so pages of hysteria get real this is the century modern technology and business innovation have given americans marvelous new options for travel work leisure and yes consumption in other words our society is evolving the local coffeehouse now has a starbucks sign hanging in it main street is dead replaced by a row of 24 hour big box stores spending one 's life hanging out with good ol ' bob and joyce from down the block has been swept away by internet chat rooms and social mobility most of us are happy with this arrangement if you are n't then that 's fine but keep your damn noses out of our business i give this book two stars rather than one because they bring out a solitary point worth pondering how corporations like mcdonald 's deliberately market to kids even teaching them how to bilk money out of their parents bravo for pointing this out ! but rather than big brother tackling this problem how about parents grow spines learn to say no '' and tell the companies they wo n't get another bloody dime until they amend their marketing practices that 's a solution that goes unmentioned in this preachy whiny paternalistic volume in the end it 's the individual not the collective that guides society let 's have more celebration of individualism and less of the socialistic nonsense our authors seek to impose on us for our own good of course
i was very much looking forward to recieving this title from after reading the first few pages online and admittedly i did like the first few chapters however the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly and became almost smug and the authors seemed far too pleased with themselves and by approximately the halfway point i felt as if i were reading some kind of bizzare conservationist manifesto i like to think as a conservationist and vegan that i try to mind mother nature and all living creatures but after i finished reading this repetitive pedantic bore i lost the will to care maybe i am being too harsh but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter then it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant others liked the book and that 's fine but i was disappointed
i have listened to and enjoyed many books on cd in the past few years this reader is among the worst that i 've had the displeasure of hearing the content of this book is great so do n't get me wrong however the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended he pronounces many character names incorrectly including carpathia and adbullah his character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive annoying especially carpathia 's his voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue he also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason these are just the most obvious and annoying problems there are too many to list completely here so please trust me and avoid listening to this book
i dragged myself through every novel in this series with like compulsion always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our lord therefore i anticipated this final novel to be glorious as the title indicates but i was woefully wrong are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming king and his kingdom certainly not ! i support christian fiction with many 5 star reviews just look at my other reviews but i can not recommend this series
my kids started reading the left behind kids books and because i was concerned about the message and theology of the books i started reading them also then i decided to check out the adult '' books from the library i am a pentacostal believer in jesus christ and parts of the theology are not what i read in the bible i can stil enjoy a good book one with interesting characters realistic dialogue and a good plot the issue of plot is difficult for the left behind books i admit because we know who wins if we 've read the end of the new testament as to the rest it fell flat most of the dialogue did n't ring true after a few of the books i was interested in some of the characters but by the end of the books there were only a few of the original characters left and they were some of the least interesting to begin with how many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in revelation how many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in book 1 there is nothing new and interesting in this book the last book is just boring it would have been nice at the end of the book to wrap up everything jesus comes back and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over right some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all it was an incredible let down i felt like i had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over nothing we stick with that one main guy and everyone else is left in the dust it should have had a really really happy ending but even that was boring if i had my time back i would stick to the kid versions if only to discuss theological issues with my children at least in the kid books the sermons are shorter and i will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series
tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts '' or scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period '' series see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items
did not like thought stories were full of idealistic nonsense unrealistic options for the family farmer

near the level of magician apprentice and magician master now those were awesome
the religion of peace is at it again ! in response to the popes words muslims all over the world respond with violence destruction rage hatred burning down buildings burning papal effigies issuing fatwas against the pope and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back wow such peace from a religion of peace '' if islam is a religion of peace then all the guns in the world are pink flowers and every nuclear bomb a soft feathery pillow violence for words destruction for speech please ! this is a religion of war and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america question when will the world start holding to account the actions of muslims and stop blaming others such as bush america the pope or god knows who else how many more innocent people will die at the hand of muslims before the western world finally and for the first time holds the muslims accountable for their own actions rather than someone else well im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of islamofacism im tired of the leftist media beating up on israel and coming to the side of tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words and then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope ! can you believe it ! ! yes idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word its unreal ! a grown man got a gun deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman 's backside and deliberately pulled the trigger purposefully killing her in cold blood yet according to socialist leftists he could n't help it its not his fault its the pope 's fault guys ! respond to words with violence and then blame the speaker absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility as absurd as that sounds i 'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that and they are idiots like noam
i picture chomsky in a sunless cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers surrounded only by walls of his own clippings yes his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world not everything is a conspiracy theory and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture the world is too random for all similar events to be related but when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts the result is going to be nonsense i respect chomsky 's right to say what he thinks and as a liberal i often find myself agreeing with him but for vastly different reasons what i do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems to me he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that was perpetrated by the government i am not excusing the actions of any administration past or present all that i am saying is that the actions of the 10 20 even 50 years ago bear little relation to each other or to the present and where they do it is not worth arguing that it is the result of some phenomenon of evil power the world is comprised of random actors interacting constantly and to say that the should be able to control or foresee the future is nonsense all the can do is preserve and fight for its own interests which is all that any state does chomsky 's stance is based on an vision of a utopia one far distanced from the real world in which we live in chomsky 's world it is possible for everyone to get along in a state of equality and no interests ever conflict in the real world interests do conflict and equality is impossible without sacrificing absolute welfare while i often disagree with the chosen approach to resolving those conflicts i at least accept that the conflict needed resolution and that doing so presented difficulties beyond the ability of a human mind to conceive sometimes we get it right sometimes we do n't but it is only a fool who would take all of the failures and weave together a story of evil intentions that chavez would brandish chomsky 's book while ranting and raving about good and evil on the floor of the shows just what company chomsky 's theories find for him chomsky 's theories could use less lofty language and more grounding on planet earth it is no wonder that half of the evidence provided can not be backed up with verifiable sources
this is a spiteful hateful man who is out of his element outside of linguistics and he got that wrong as well
chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist is he begins with a typical theory america is bad and all that it does is bad finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme despite chomsky 's belief that bin laden 's attacks were driven by us foreign policy all one has to do is go to the source whom chomsky believes can be taken at his word to realize the goals of bin laden all actions taken by bin laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal to the islamic caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on shari'a it is driven by a chauvinistic belief that dar es harb '' does not deserve its prosperity and dar es salam '' deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage realistically the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the caliphate is the united states and the force it can project to prevent this and that 's why bin laden believes it needs to be destroyed one does not even have to stoop to chomsky 's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point bin laden 's own words are very clear on this the pious caliphate will start from afghanistan '' this is bin laden 's reason for everything else from the palestinian issue to iraq to saudi arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support but his core ideology a shari'a governed islamic caliphate is what motivates his backers allies and foot soldiers chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated bin laden is more a projection of his own beliefs ideology and motivations for wanting to see america destroyed than bin laden 's motivations chomsky on september is like someone who upon hearing that reagan was shot immediately launches into a tirade about the contras cuba palestine vietnam etcetera only to be told that was all about jodie foster his analysis if that 's what one could call this tripe about bin laden also repeats the often told lie that bin laden was involved with the us during the 80 's in afghanistan the mujahideen were split into 6 different factions three of which were hardliner islamists islamic party islamic society islamic unity and three moderate factions islamic revolutionary movement national islamic front and national liberation front none of these factions were led by bin laden and not all them were supplied by america the hardliners were supplied by pakistan egypt and saudi arabia do n't believe it look up rober fisk 's interview with bin laden in 1988 where bin laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the us during the afghan jihad if you want to know who bin laden is read michael scheuer if you want to know what drives him read daniel pipes and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read chomsky
i havent get the book yet back order it is been like almost 2 months
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of you n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel pick up the elegant naval institute press edition in a modern complete updated translation with commentary by the leading american verne expert today walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by margot president najvs
despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon i really cant appreciate the value usefulness or practicality of this book the proposed framework that each difficult conversation is really three the what happened the feelings '' and the identity '' conversations is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem you may think i am a contrarian or a poor communicator however with my very positive experience and reviews on books like how to win friends and influence people '' by dale calegie get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again '' by david lieberman how to talk to anyone '' by leil lowndes and so on i am obliged to warn potential buyers in particular regular readers of relevant books of a big disappointment
i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until now i was disapointed with this one and not found artmis unusaly irritating but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good truth be told i was younger when i read the first three but still i can reread them and enjoy them as i did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris so if you want my advice then i suggst you do n't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace
vicky oliver is a woman lives in new york and works in the advertising industry nothing wrong with any of that except that she tends to forget that not everyone is exactly like her the result of this is that if like me you are a man live in south carolina and borrowed this book from your local library in order to prepare for an interview for an administrative position with the state highway patrol much of the book might as well have been written in chinese good for urban professional women seeking executive positions but of limited use to anyone else
did n't care for this book at all if you want to learn about stephen king you 'd be much better off reading or listening to his book on quot
this is a big disappointment ! pictures are not all on one page the animals are split in half because of this what a dumb idea ! ! save your money this book is n't worth half of what i paid
the beauty is guerilla marketing falls within the standards of using multiple accounts to create very convincing and completely flattering reviews of books so that you sell more of them bit of paradox be warned about books with such flawless ratings btw i 'm a marketing manager i eat this sort of stuff up in fact for this book appeared in my search results while researching a search engine company cheers and i 'd suggest you save your cash and watch more geico commercials ! SMILE
what has happened to sue henry this book is such a let down i almost thought that she had someone else write it the story is flat and the sentence structures are confusing sorry to say that i really ca n't recommend this even though i wanted to
president bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on pluto just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack a secret cabal of sceintologists have taken over the defense department and a working for donald rumsfeld who is actually ron hubbard come back from the dead right wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from jack abramoff in order to make money for tom delay 's trial samuel alito is actually pat robertson under a mission impossible style mask edmund burke and john adams planned the jfk assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations if you believe any of the above then you will love brock 's book if not then its not the book for you
the reader interested in moss hart and the golden age of broadway will be much better served by going directly to steven bach 's biography brown 's workmanlike tome is short on style short on feeling for the era something bach provides in spades and the material from hart 's diaries does n't amount to much compare bach 's thrilling of the birth of my fair lady with brown 's tepid version to name one instance and you 'll see why bach 's is by far the better book dazzler is indeed dazzling brown 's prince does nothing to bach 's definitive bio and lacks i say
i 'm sorry but this book went way over my head was this the plan or am i just not up to all this
whatsoe'er word that penrose has written that word shall i read for it is my solemn duty to imbibe the ideas of another person and come to grips with them this i style philosophy thank goodness i have rog ' to argue '' for a philosophical position '' and of course there will be lots of people arguing against him they will all be jostling around like on the floor of the exchange waving little slips of paper sweating grimacing their faces a gray screen with hustler faces moving across it but lets see let me furrow my brow and adopt a serious expression when the words physicalism '' and mentalism '' are bandied let me puff on my pipe and say hmmmm '' at irregular intervals let me hear mention of john searle with a straight face for this is the stuff of life
godel 's theorem has been entirely overused ! lets get one thing straight people all that theorem says is that in any decently powerful formal system you are forced to decide between either have a complete but inconsistent system or have an incomplete but consistent system ! it has no relevance to ai so go find some other argument to bolster your
i 'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face same would go if i were reviewing the fear of flying or a room of one 's own both of which are far superior to this outing although of different genres but i 'll go ahead and write one anyways nafisi 's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in tehran did n't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students i know i may get lambasted for saying so but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion instead we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general the layers of interpretation for a character such as humbert is simplified to either he 's a villian or a misunderstood villian neither of which deals with many of the nuances nabakov has included you would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students the strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the west who comes back to iran to teach i think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave english professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country on a more stylistic level i was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them actually become a massive blob without much indivuality i had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else even though he does play an important role although a subtle one in many scenes i think i expected a lot from this novel that i could n't get from picking up a newspaper and i did n't get much beyond that
the crossing by cormac mccarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of america the story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from mexico the wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her this part was particularly well written but became confusing when spanish was being used heavily in review of this part i believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues the story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected though that would have ended the book rather abruptly the two sons decided to return the wolf to mexico after this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob attempting but failing to join the army and crossing in and out of mexico a total of 3 times this was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point the over use of the spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who does n't speak it i thought this book lacked motivation and suspense but because of the author 's brilliant mastery of the english language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through
the crossing is set in new mexico and mexico in the late during the last days of the wild west before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all the story is centred on two adolescent monsyllabilic farmer 's sons in new mexico when a wolf comes up from mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf mccarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting but sadly short period of the book ends when the older son alone catches the wolf here he decides rather than kill it to return it to mexico from where it came when he reaches mexico he is surprised to find the mexicans do n't see his generosity in quite the same light after they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs billy shoots it and drifts through mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves an obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to mexico with an unclear goal except to find their horses a big country in which to find half a dozen horses and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page it is a pity that although mccarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking nor why what motivates billy and boyd for the entire book we never find out they meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent spanish they also meet several mexicans some with their parent 's horses and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes later boyd the younger brother runs off with the girl billy returns to the usa tries and fails to join the army we are now in the and so works on various ranches before returning to mexico for the third time to find his brother in crossing ' there are in fact three ' into mexico which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people much like the usa in fact through the book there are few endearing likeable characters that the reader can actually root for the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions much of the dialogue is in spanish and difficult to follow mccarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking spanish but many readers of english literature do not and with so much dialogue in spanish and untranslated it makes the story difficult to follow this is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation mr mccarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the english language and is there to make the language more comprehensible to eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying but stops readers from enjoying the writing reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally at times crossing ' was much like reading a legal document you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what mccarthy is saying yet mccarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations behind the faade of spanish dialogue unpunctuated english and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here it is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of to express himself
having read all the pretty horses blood meridian and now the crossing i feel a little compelled to comment i got through 3 of mccarthy 's books because the writing technique is very good the imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take but in retrospect this book was awful the book should have been titled the crossings because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into mexico three times each time for a less compelling reason i almost expected he 'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey and while mccarthy 's writing is good it 's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips the 3 books i mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with mexico mccarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession for mccarthy mexico is the land where the upright brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food or test his manly mettle with their perfidy referring to mexico as a negligible republic '' and comments about being '' make mccarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability a mccarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a ralph lauren model another tendency of mccarthy extended monologues by wizened codgers the pathetic thing is that the protagonist 's response to these windy metaphysics is usually uh huh well got ta move long now '' if you have to read mccarthy read blood meridian and plan on skimming
i 'm glad to see i 'm not the only one to notice the preaching in this book not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that i was expecting to learn a lot more most of the things mentioned i already knew i graduated from high school in and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education
davis 's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling white men were all bad indians were good women were brave conservatives are republicans are bad and pro business was silly and all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor 's filter davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy this is offensive when it neglects margaret sanger 's racism and communist depredations
i 'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face same would go if i were reviewing the fear of flying or a room of one 's own both of which are far superior to this outing although of different genres but i 'll go ahead and write one anyways nafisi 's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in tehran did n't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students i know i may get lambasted for saying so but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion instead we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general the layers of interpretation for a character such as humbert is simplified to either he 's a villian or a misunderstood villian neither of which deals with many of the nuances nabakov has included you would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students the strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the west who comes back to iran to teach i think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave english professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country on a more stylistic level i was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them actually become a massive blob without much indivuality i had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else even though he does play an important role although a subtle one in many scenes i think i expected a lot from this novel that i could n't get from picking up a newspaper and i did n't get much beyond that
the amazing part of this tragedy is that shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans directly or indirectly this book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior while this book has become a major read for those who are into victimhood '' the sad truth is that shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise good night killer
type smudges translation bad in short a disposable boo
who published these weak translations yup they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper b n needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality
you do n't need to trust me you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the frog king '' which is unreadable someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper this does not do justice to the tales
while i 'm sure the stories are great i ca n't get past the poor type setting and cheap paper which is practically newsprint the words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult and to make matters worse the stories are set in a terrible hard to read font and tight leading this book is not at all yuck ! same is true of the hans christian andersen fairy tales by same
the only reason i finished the transit of venus '' was the hope of any improvement this book took away two hours of my hours that i can never earn back by reading true literature the story is there a story is dreadful the sentence structures the paragraph performances the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her insights i will never recommend this book to any audience hazzard and her publisher should refund my money
zweig made his reputation as a market timer and of this book presents a detailed market timing model that incorporates both money indicators '' prime rate fed funds rate consumer debt and a basic momentum indicator the model is relatively simple and the method is clearly explained according to zweig 's data the system produced remarkable results up through the final revision of this book in 1996 but of course you have to wonder the book has been revised four times since its initial publication in 1986 and yet not a single revision in the past ten years hmmmm wonder why unfortunately the obvious answer is the correct one zweig 's super model '' which he touts as the only investment model you will ever need '' yes that 's an actual chapter title utterly failed after 1996. some other reviewers claim to have followed the model successfully since the last edition of the book i do n't know what numbers they 're working with but i 've done the very tedious work to recreate the signals the model would have given since 1996 using only actual data available as of the date it became available following zweig 's methodology precisely and applying it to the value line arithmetic index a very close substitute for the proprietary benchmark he uses in the book from march 1996 the last data point in the book through june 28 2006 the value line index produced a gain of 222.8 buy hold excluding dividends following the zweig super model '' generated a gain of 95.5 not including interest income while in cash and following the model produced a gain of only 18.4 yes that 's total not annualized so much for the super model '' as for zweig 's stock picking method it 's a pretty straightforward approach blending garp and momentum and is very capably summarized on aaii 's excellent web site save yourself the time and money and just go there if you want a starting point for stock screening ideas
the authors of this book are concerned americans are n't doing what they should specifically to paraphrase former president bill clinton they 're not spending their money right they value things they should n't they work too much they own too much they shop at evil big box stores like so with paternalistic concern in their hearts they have written this book to warn us that we 're in need of a correction the enemies they identify read like a laundry list of the left 's archetypal villians wealthy merchants credit card companies and of course ronald reagan along the way they disparage virtually every technological and economic innovation that has occured over the last 25 years particularly sickening is the warm fuzzy picture they paint of the good old days '' when most americans bought their goods from locally owned stores i grew up in a town identical to the one they idolize in this book it sucked all of the stores were located around the downtown square they closed at six o'clock or earlier wednesdays most did n't open at all sunday was dead parking was extremely limited lack of selection forced consumers to go from one shop to another often in blistering summer heat or freezing winter temperatures prices were high and selection limited especially bitter are the memories i have of trying to find work in these businesses while in high school virtually all the owners had their kids filling what few jobs existed being from a family i desperately needed to work to help my family out but i was unable to find anything in the stagnant local economy then one day a came to town my mom took me there on a bright saturday morning she was ecstatic here at last was a wide variety of goods she could afford she did n't have to hurry to get there before the store closed at dinner time as for me i landed a position with the store which allowed me to contribute to the family income as well as save for college writers of books like this one love to talk about how merchandisers like steamroll '' over main street stores like do n't put guns to anyone 's head to gain them as customers rather the local people look at main street with its inflated prices inconvenient hours and parking and limited selection and then at the new home depot or whatever and freely choose how to best spend their money in other words they control the way their community works and no one seems to mind except for a handful of elitists living in faraway places who are upset that people would rather spend less of their money than live the rest of their lives in a norman rockwell painting but i 've saved the worst for last after wringing their hands for a couple hundred pages over the current state of prosperity in this country the authors outline their plan for recovery '' guess what it consists of bingo ! higher taxes and more government control they even pull that tired old cliche out of their rectums we must protect the children '' not from sexual predators or terrorists but from the local mall my response to this 300 or so pages of hysteria get real this is the century modern technology and business innovation have given americans marvelous new options for travel work leisure and yes consumption in other words our society is evolving the local coffeehouse now has a starbucks sign hanging in it main street is dead replaced by a row of 24 hour big box stores spending one 's life hanging out with good ol ' bob and joyce from down the block has been swept away by internet chat rooms and social mobility most of us are happy with this arrangement if you are n't then that 's fine but keep your damn noses out of our business i give this book two stars rather than one because they bring out a solitary point worth pondering how corporations like mcdonald 's deliberately market to kids even teaching them how to bilk money out of their parents bravo for pointing this out ! but rather than big brother tackling this problem how about parents grow spines learn to say no '' and tell the companies they wo n't get another bloody dime until they amend their marketing practices that 's a solution that goes unmentioned in this preachy whiny paternalistic volume in the end it 's the individual not the collective that guides society let 's have more celebration of individualism and less of the socialistic nonsense our authors seek to impose on us for our own good of course
i was very much looking forward to recieving this title from after reading the first few pages online and admittedly i did like the first few chapters however the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly and became almost smug and the authors seemed far too pleased with themselves and by approximately the halfway point i felt as if i were reading some kind of bizzare conservationist manifesto i like to think as a conservationist and vegan that i try to mind mother nature and all living creatures but after i finished reading this repetitive pedantic bore i lost the will to care maybe i am being too harsh but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter then it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant others liked the book and that 's fine but i was disappointed
greene is a conman you dopes ! you 're being set up to buy this watered down machiavellian compost using the 50 of his laws '' that do n't contradict the other 50 he gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified desirable and trustworthy you 're all going to die sorry try to imagine what they 'll be saying at your funeral no matter how rich and powerful you in your dreams become by using the nonsense in this book man what a selfish prick '' would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment
if you are a man you will not like this collection of feminist essays this book is worse than bad it is an abomination
i want to make a short comment here 1 this book is quite confusing it mixed up the real story with the make up one 2 saying that ramanujun thought goldbach conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake everyone believe that goldbach conjecture is true and ramanujun is a real genius i can not stand this make up part
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels '' and because i 'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium not on the mound on the field this book was published posthumously and shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose prose that was excellent in killer angels '' it 's unfortunate there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author 's other book
i ca n't review something you keep sending me when it 's the wrong bible you do n't have the one i ordered you do n't have the one that you have on your sight so you send me a diffront one the one i ordered was printed and you send a book printed in 2003

a highly detailed coverage of the third reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in germany during the 1930 decade overall i would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to world war ii the devil however is in the details the author makes sweeping statements about the versaille treaty that are neither logical or reasonable he fails to place the beginnings of the practice of racial hygiene in germany within the larger context of the worldwide movement in that area when he mentions the spanish civil war he quotes from some sources that are known to be inaccurate these are just a few areas where the author has been less than thorough despite the foregoing i would gladly urge people interested in the history of the twentieth century to read this book always bearing in mind that this obviously vast subject is covered incompletely here
why are americans so fat according to this clown it 's because of fast food which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves our laziness and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline gee i wish mommy government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions ! then everything would be right with the world after all no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them right people should n't have to make decisions for themselves ! it 's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what 's best for ourselves someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the internet
what a bunch of high school hallway gossip ! the author does not know the difference between white and albino ! the 'genetics ' discussions on color which includes people chickens horses and dogs all of it suspect and mutts purebred dogs are total claptrap ! i confess i could n't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies ' what a waste of my having read those parts i can not believe anything that went before or that follows not that i 'm reading any further how is a author allowed to put such uneducated 'information ' into print and now she 's influenced readers a terrible situation publisher where are your reviews shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published !
the first sentence in the book is people who are n't autistic always ask me about the moment i realized i could understand the way animals think '' it should have been people who are n't autistic always ask me about the moment i somehow got the noton that i could understand the way animals think '' there 's no proof in this book no good evidence just grandin 's anecdotes and speculations noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think the book does offer many clear simple descriptions of scientists ' research so if you do n't know anything about animal research these descriptions could be a good place to start
honestly i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive the author 's main point although interesting seems to me like it would fit into an essay also the particular print of the book that i purchased has a dog on the cover i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior instead i felt i little duped most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person or anedoctal accounts of my friend 's dog fido one day did this '' i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population i mean the author does n't even have a dog ! ! i suspect that i who have had a lifelong history with dogs have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author i do n't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there now if your thing '' is cows get this book !
i have more than 15 years of project management experience i 've read this and quite a few other pmp books from cover to cover most of the reviews on this page sound like a propaganda to me this book gives you the impression that it 's a big book and must be covering lots of material but this in my opinion is not true it 's big due to the large font and because most of the space on each page is empty furthermore the book is mostly a of the pmbok guide but only with less information and without any apparent consideration to and description of the exam objectives or specifications i found that this is the problem with most of the pmp books except the one by sanghera most of the topics in this book are not covered to adequate depth for example pareto chart is presented without much explanation just one example of an approach that permeates throughout the whole book using simple language is good property of this book but at places the concepts are oversimplified so that the accuracy can be questioned most of the review and exam questions are too simplistic they may be ok for the capm exam but not for the pmp exam to me it 's does not seem like a professionally prepared book for example binding is weak most of the tables and figures are not numbered and index is very poorly prepared and is not very useful just considering the shallow coverage of the topics i would not count on this book solely for the exam we are lucky that there are quite a few pmp books out there to choose from here is my recommendation of pmp books in descending order 1. pmp exam prep by rita mulcahy quite a bit of exercises and explanations at least refers to pmbok guide when does not explain something 2. pmp in depth by paul sanghera pretty much self contained and adequately covers almost all the exam topics in the beginning of each chapter describes the pmp exam objectives covered in the chapter 3. pmp study guide by joseph phillips quite a few topics are covered in much detail however at places not very compatible with pmbok guide 4. the pmp exam by andy crowe this book a good additional resource but not comprehensive enough
really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
allison announces in his first sentence of his preface that this the edition of a book originally published in 1983 is substantially revised '' and so it is especially the last half of it it was an important work of scholarship 23 years ago and a revision after so much time during which he has remained a teacher and scholar specializing in kant was bound to excite broad interest it must have gone far toward gaining for him the prestigious prize of he was awarded last year 2005 for outstanding kantian scholarship in the preface allison cites michelle grier as having awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers in the body of the text he mentions her name only once but given the compliment to her my curiosity was aroused first i looked at the endnotes in which her work was mentioned by allison and then a little puzzled i looked carefully over her book kant 's doctrine of transcendental illusion published in 2001. i found many citations of her work in the endnotes adding them up i found that there were 28 endnotes these referred by explicit citation to 200 pages of her 305 page book what one finds in comparing the two books his and hers is that every idea or argument that allison advances and almost every reference citation to kant or to other philosophers supposition hypothesis or development is to be found explicitly in grier it is impossible to compare the two books and not conclude that allison had no new ideas of his own at all at least for the last half of his book the half that he claims developments in kantian scholarship had compelled him to fully and carefully rethink and therefore to have most fully revised if one were to remove from allison 's book however the ideas arguments and so forth that he derived directly and unambiguously from grier there would be nothing but minor and for the most part exceedingly trivial asides it would to put it simply not have been publishable it is apparent that rather than generously recognizing michelle grier by his compliments and endnotes he was stabbing her in the back his generous '' remarks have the effect of diminishing her role in his accomplishment he makes it seem as though she inspired him or set him on the right track rather than to have fashioned the final intellectual product that he merely but arrogantly rephrased nowhere does he acknowledge the incontestable truth as of course he can not that he was himself entirely empty and given a choice between remaining silent or stealing from the younger creative scholar michelle grier the work he wished he had produced himself he chose the shabbier but more profitable course
if you 've ever seen the great movie thirteenth warrior that was based on this book eaters of the dead '' will just not measure up maybe the structure of the book was the problem crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document maybe he was too successful with that conceit it was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension character development or an elevated literary style unfortunately those qualities are necessary in a novel this was mostly a bore do n't bother
so i 've got a bookstore and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up so why is it that i see so many positive reviews here myself i thought the authentic feel was a definite plus much of the time i did feel that i was reading an ancient memoir but as for being a page turner '' as somebody else called it you 've got to be joking this book is one of the slowest novels i 've ever read i did it on audio book and i kept falling asleep it was a lot like sitting in driver 's ed after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus creighton has written some pretty fun stuff some of it even mildly thought provoking but his is neither timeline and the two jurassic park books fit well into the whole roller coaster of a book '' thing and personally i thought sphere was great i realize that there is n't too much in the way of popular viking fiction out there and so i suppose if you 've got to have a valhalla fix you could check this out but i 'd still recommend the kirk douglas movie vikings '' over this book or maybe the book grendel '' by john gardener which is based on the same epic poem but this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson
this book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if james frey did not repeat himself a million times although the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive this book however did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox he could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out even though his tactic was to show how brave he was the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind ! this book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late like it almost was for james it was just an okay book and we hope james frey 's next book will be much more interesting
i think if you 've lived life under a rock watched a lot of soap operas and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas this book will appeal to you it makes me angry to read this book not because it 's fiction and i 'll call it completely fictitious garbage but because james frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction ! he writes this book with an underlying tone i 'm better than all of you '' not because he thinks aa is bs but because this theme runs throughout his book in so many situations that after awhile it becomes laughable ! he prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain except his tough guy friends '' i ask you if leonard has such a reputation where 's his protection people would be after him in such a vulnerable read no security place like rehab i think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its bs by feeling its predictability it reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people yeah he 's got problems but he 'll prevail because he 's james frey ! no thank you i absolutely hated this book but i read it so i at least deserve credit for trying
i 'd heard the buzz both pro and con and thought i 'd take an independent read i was dismayed with this book james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him lies are what enable slips '' and enabling '' and denial '' and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure recovery is nearly impossible without honesty so can we look at this man 's memoir '' and expect it to offer anything of value it 's poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic even if oprah had n't exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers '' like frey 's account of the drug house visit in which he rescues '' lilly other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and i ca n't improve on that suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept like a joke of some kind i 'm not laughing
it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read i read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about the writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read i ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over i know this is supposed to be for emphasis but i just found it indulgent the lack of correct punctuation was distracting too had i read this when the book first came out before everyone knew he lied i would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of aa although i have not attended aa or any similar support groups i feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own which in most cases i am sure they are not i found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than james frey and i ca n't say that i felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself i am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he is n't feeling so badly anymore
the reviews all sounded so good i could n't resist i was hoping for another memoirs of a geisha '' but boy was i disappointed the story bounces all over the place never seems to have a consistent theme and finally turns out to be just plain boring i 'll give the author some credit the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in asia myself i enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era unfortunately the budding story of a war hero 's longing for a very young girl he refers to her as the changeling '' made the guy come off looking like a pedophile seriously pretentious readers will love this drivel too bad i ca n't recover the hours i wasted on this schlock with any luck it 'll be another 20 years before 'ol shirley picks up her pen again
this book was so boring i could barely stand it in fact i had to abandon ship halfway through the main character is kind of interesting as are the two kids but the story itself is so that the characters ca n't carry the book i am a huge reader and i can count on one hand the times i 've had to quit a book midway but this one just could n't hold my interest i found myself daydreaming everytime i tried to read it the writing was over the top the author sounds as if she 's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess but do n't believe them one of the worst books i 've ever read
some books in my opinion are just plain overrated the characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting likewise the tale the reader takes nothing from it put this in a list with franzen 's the corrections and frazier 's cold mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades
the only great thing about the great fire '' is its name this is one of those books that as you read it you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield about the dog that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war japan and the australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager or was the chap british and the she the bosses wife who strangely winked at you during the last christmas party and you felt like choking he must have been australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in australia but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read but who really cares whether the australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other after all the world really changed since 1947 and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to steamer ' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression but back to the book ! if you love british style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps with names like bertram and aldred get together to have some tea then in their spare time write long romantic letters and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2 this is the book for you if you are like me meaning you have so much on your mind that it 'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages then i highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one by simon cleveland
this is such a waste of talent it was only published because shiley hazzard has written a better book the story was dull the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable what kind of people would ignore their children this way depressing and a waste of time
despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon i really cant appreciate the value usefulness or practicality of this book the proposed framework that each difficult conversation is really three the what happened the feelings '' and the identity '' conversations is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem you may think i am a contrarian or a poor communicator however with my very positive experience and reviews on books like how to win friends and influence people '' by dale calegie get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again '' by david lieberman how to talk to anyone '' by leil lowndes and so on i am obliged to warn potential buyers in particular regular readers of relevant books of a big disappointment
inane useless information from a speaker so boring i could hardly get through the 3 cd 's but felt like i had to since i had spent the money on them perhaps he is a great i can not see it i bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box i think this information was aimed at someone in grade school not a professional sales person
the content is full of valuable information on selling but this audio cd is not my favourite ziglar speaks so rapidly and ! i guess nobody speaks in this mannner i mean if you want listeners to enjoy your speech it is better to speak in a more natural pace occassionally there should be a pause ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this cd choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever ! slow down slow down ziglar ! give me some space to absorb your message ! i wish i can listen to your cd comfortably but i ca n't you read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works ziglar ! i am sorry i have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this cd
i read this book because of the good reviews by the end of the book i wanted to shake alison and dump her myself
this is the story of alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he 's had an affair with for months this story was so disappointing it 's like dunn took the same ideas as jennifer weiner 's good in bed being dumped religion pregnancy friends etc but the end result is disappointing the heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an evangelical christian who cares how she slept with few men etc this story is not realistic it 's not that funny and the heroin is disappointing if you want the real thing read jennifer weiner but not dunn sorry
this book is not great really not great it is decent but not nearly what i was expecting the cover says that it is a highlight reel from sex and the city one of my very favorite shows but it was so opposite of satc that i ca n't even understand the comparison the main character does n't live in nyc and does n't write a column about sex but does write a column it 's about a girl one who hates her evangelical christian background so she has sex with a couple guys but it is n't about loving the man it 's about wanting not to be a christian i finished it to find out what ends up happening but i was really dissapointed do n't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you do n't hate evangelical christians
i tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time i did n't give it a chance i could n't read anymore after the second decision it 's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it it 's the same old stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse i feel cheated that i paid 1.29 for it at the thrift store
i bought this book based on the blurbs and the fact that i enjoy an occasional steven covey type read this sure was n't one of them i started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point thinking that maybe this was n't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion but that maybe for whatever reason my head was n't into it i took it on a recent vacation thinking that with my mind unfettered perhaps i might be more open to what the book had to say wrong this is a terribly written book with a hokey style by an author in need of some creative writing classes spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new for pete 's sake basically this fellow took zig ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'time bandits ' style confrontations with famous characters i noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue when anne frank has the same speech patterns as solomon and harry truman i know i 'm reading a really bad book comparing this to og mandino is an insult to og this book is to motivational literature what 'bridges of madison county ' was to fiction
as all the other reviews are positive i will add a much needed critical perspective the central argument of this book is that '' the combination of indian predation and environmental change decimated the bison '' isenberg as such this book contradicts massive amounts of primary historical sources that show that the destruction and near extinction of the bison herds was a direct result of anglo predation in a direct attempt to destroy the resource base of the plains tribes in order to force them onto reservations as the other reviewers have pointed out it is true that the plains tribes were not nomadic hunters for all of their history it is true that the tribes adopted nomadic hunting as a primary subsistence strategy only after being forced to do so by anglo aggression and encroachment but from that truth isenberg moves on to a series of unproven theories based on questionable ecological assumptions that are rooted in the new ecology '' an ecological theory that describes nature as a disordered chaotic and individualistic struggle for survival for info on the new ecology '' see my review of discordant harmonies a new ecology for the century for example isenberg bases one of his arguments on the theory that early tribal peoples thousands of years ago hunted to extinction many species of large land mammals but the story of the bison is not a story it is a story of modern history and isenberg presents no historical proof that the tribes were responsible for the near extinction of the bison rather he makes subjective philosophical arguments against romanticizing '' wilderness and native american cultures from there iverson uses these arguments as a backdrop to a series of environmental statistical analyses basically iverson lays out an exponential statistical model where by he argues that given the estimated number of bison deaths necessary to sustain the plains tribes eventually the bison would have been rendered extinct by the tribes at some point in the future the problem is that this can never be proven because it never happened ! what happened and it is documented in massive amounts of printed primary historical sources was that the bison were deliberately slaughtered by greedy anglo hunters for their skins and tongues the united states army was in on it as well as is documented by many sources showing that the bison herds were decimated in a deliberate attempt to make it impossible for the tribes to remain living free on the plains isenberg 's book is one that must be extremely comforting to those forces that continue to destroy what wild animals and lands we have left here in north america
i have been a trainer for many years and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist and i can tell you that paul owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training this book is an average at best compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other professional dog i 've read many many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing if you 're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do check out any of stanley coren 's books he has many if you 're looking for training techniques take a class honestly there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes with a respectable and knowledgable trainer where they can be properly socialized and trained if your dog is having serious behavior issues consult a professional animal behaviorist your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody good luck !
sorry but i 'm just not a fan of clicker training or the concept of waiting around until your dog happens to do something that you want it to do granted there is some helpful advice given within the pages of this book but i 'm very glad i did n't pay regular retail for it yay amazon !
note that this video has nothing to do with cesar millan 's television show on the national geographic channel called the dog whisperer '' the dvd teaches the most basic dog commands and is but if you want books or dvds related to cesar millan this item has nothing do with him ! it is a different author teaching altogether different things writing before the television show was on the air
i read cesar millan 's book and thought that this bood would be similiar in information and instruction i was completely wrong i skimmed over every section because each section was so basic the teaching method is completely different from millan 's and therefore a complete waste of money
diana 's other novels i have read and getting blissfully lost in them each time but this was did n't fit with the others a little too earthy '' for my tastes
i had loved the outlander books and i felt a sense of loss when i finished them natually the next step was to get the lord john book even though it 's unrelated to the outlander books i thought it would be just as engrossing and entertaining i was very dissappointed the story was not that interesting and the characters were not very well developed or likable i read the book to the end but i really could n't care less how it ended or what happened to these people i would not recommend this book to anyone
i realize that 'ruined my life ' may be a bit harsh but i 'll tell you why this is true for me i read this book and decided that i too would feel great and look great just like suzanne i would go on hormones that was 2 years ago since then i have lost almost 40 of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science the doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about months i was told to 'be patient ' that it would 'normalize ' i later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take and now 2 years later i am in hell because of this book i ca n't believe how stupid i was
some of this book is good and normally i love suzanne summers but a few comments like no wonder men leave us for younger woman '' like what is that about woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging when i ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first i just felt the book was a push for the s principle book and to be hot for your guy usually her stuff is good but i was n't crazy about this one sorry nothing new in this book maybe helpful to someone else jud
hormones are not all they are cracked up to be they have serious dangerous impacts on the human body please if you are going to try these do your homework first a growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects some do n't make it out the other side i am one of the lucky ones i survived the blood clots in my legs and two illnesses connected with use of natural '' progesterone since that time i have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones i hope this information will be helpful to someone else too please safeguard your health no one else is going to do it for you
the premise was great the storytelling very awkward the technological information could have been interesting but it read like an instruction manual i give one star for the final and another for the funny way clancy portrayed the soviet apparatchiks
the most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant the book is not about a theory of leadership but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree the rest of his book is meaningless heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you do n't then you are n't a good leader so in heifetz 's world reagan was n't a good leader but lbj was do yourself a favor and keep surfing
i use the notebook '' and a walk to remember '' as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer '' i was more satisfied with the rescue '' taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl
i have read several of nicholas sparks ' books but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from sparks like the notebook '' or the wedding '' if you want a good romantic read
i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor 's was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find nothing oh what a waste it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it had n't been for my hrr home reading report i would n't have finished reading this at all i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah
was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free
i grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping as always for a good read but as well to learn a bit about a period of chinese history that i have not read deeply in alas man 's book fails on both levels halfway through and the mongols are conquering asia this part of the book is well written exactly why genghis is the leader and why the mongols are following him is left unclear indeed after a rough childhood being kidnapped and escaping genghis emerges as head of the mongols why i do not know the historical record here is probably sparse but that is no excuse to skip over these years they are pivotal to explaining why the mongols emereged would the mongols have emereged under another leader or was it just genghis the final third of the book is spent in man 's quest to find genghis grave the lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused then again is genghis 's resurrection only to be seen in man 's hiking about the mongolian woods somewhere there is a good biography of genghis and the mongols but this is certainly not it
save you money ! this is n't really suitable for anyone who cares what their children read much much better can be found elsewhere
i did n't read the entire book simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore however it does n't take much more than 20 min to get through it the book is nothing but a timeline of miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences you might learn some trivia going through it but not much else it is also not a very objective view of us history not a single factoid '' given for the 8 years of the clinton presidency was positive only negatives
dow '' wants you to believe him this time no really he means it right in 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust i think that 's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust this guy is amazing
mccarthy is a very talented writer read blood meridian and all the pretty horses but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing using many archaic words suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot despite the novel 's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character certain chapters are interesting the workhouse chapter especially but these passages are few and far between also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way mccarthy writes about nature beautifully but after finishing this book one is left unfulfilled
okay i 'm going to go against the grain here and say that suttree really is n't all that good maybe it 's fine literature although personally i do n't think so i think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of absorbed into with a pathos for its characters good or bad here we get only snatches of that we feel akin to suttree for example the prison segment is good there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book but on the whole suttree is a rambling and confusing mess why struggle so much with a book it 's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex sure at times it 's sublime but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline the reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes the relationship between suttree and harrogate is great but there needs to be more of it i feel like saying yeah yeah yeah just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of suttree 's mysterious past '' if you want to read this you have been warned you will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting if you think it 's worth it in the name of literature '' then that 's up to you note i have read blood meridian and thought it was an excellent book definitely go read that one first and i read a child of god which was also great i was hoping to become more of a cormac mccarthy fan reading this one but i think i 've gotten to the point where i 'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms mccarthy is a master of the language no doubt but in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting
i came across this book when advising a friend 's child who was researching careers and was using this book on the plus side the book does contain info on basic job search skills i would say that most if not all of it is now widely available via the internet very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers some of it was just outdated but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being dangerous '' for a reader with little knowledge or experience and who would choose to spend pursuing a career based on the info in this book i would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice
sorry i just can not believe that the humorous '' and honest '' approaches recommended in this book will work it all seems very idealistic flaky and undignified i value honesty and humor too ! but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum i would find someone using these strategies very the words sense of entitlement '' come to mind and i am not conservative so what would a conservative employer think
at best dan brown 's da vinci code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones the characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70 's made for tv movies if you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin the first time the true villain makes an appearance it is basically a well is n't that contrite '' moment but it is a fast easy reading novel this book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight some people take the conspiracy overtones to being i think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book althogh there are some kooks that think this book is about reality instead of fiction a much more interesting book in a similar venue modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones is foucault 's pendulum by umberto eco be forewarned eco 's novel is a much more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel it is analogous to comparing cotton candy da vinci code to a 12 course gourmet dinner foucault 's pendulum both will satisfy hunger both are a type of food but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling
i found this to be a really annoying and in the audio format story it sounds like a screenplay with symbolism mystery and trivia that are so mediocre how best to describe it here read the book if you think this is fascinating the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it 's round like a mother 's womb if that does n't blow you away read something else the two leads are so stereotypical it hurts lastly the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal french accents that actually impede understanding of what 's being said and then he has french people speak to each other in these accents way overdone then layered on that they are explaining things to each other that any french person would already know cle de voute for example for the reader 's benefit taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie van helsing for me i 'm watching that thinking a werewolf and vampires and frankenstein and hot chicks why it 's got everything ! what next '' short attention span theater the fact that this book is so popular makes me sad
despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book there is nothing new in this title clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line it is also worth noting that at least one of the great '' organizations in the book fannie may has imploded in an accounting scandal not the worst fad management book ever written but that is n't saying much
see what happens when the author 's friends write the reviews after all the glowing raves given postwar '' i spent fancy money on it and in the end i came to agree with the only negative review of it i saw in the economist you are misled by the acuity of the first chapter in which judt explains how much the current peace of europe derives from the severe ethnic cleansing that took place there during and just after world war ii a fascinating point quite new to me but after that over 830 pages judt tries to explain everything and gets to the bottom of nothing what did margaret thatcher really accomplish for england i still do n't know though i learned a lot on my way to not knowing this was the failing cited by the economist reviewer too if you want a history of the war 's aftermath in europe though only up to the try 1945 '' by gregor dallas distilled acute clear concrete fresh and compelling maybe dallas needs to hustle academic insiders as well as judt does for unlike judt dallas actually delivers the goods and deserves the credit wasted on judt
englishman tony judt 's postwar is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking to give a coherent account of the history of europe from 1945. the outline of events is well known a continent in ruins at the end of the second world war the miraculous rise of western europe from the wreckage the concurrent enslavement of the east and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control it is a great story surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization judt seems to take the view with which most people would likely agree that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics in the big picture communism failed because it was unproductive capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite the question he asks is a good one why did it happen when it did why after having survived so long since 1917 in the case of the soviets did the eastern block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties and so rapidly his answer is astonishingly the helsinki accords against all expectation '' he claims it brezhnev 's signing of the helsinki accords was to prove mortal '' 503 the argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the helsinki accords which included some boilerplate language on human rights the communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the party he thus attributes the collapse of communism to the role of dissenters within the eastern block countries judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field not the actual players he refers to himself as having been in czechoslovakia at this time perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the soviet satellites were something other than marginal as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces in this book vaclav havel plays a far greater role than ronald reagan in the collapse of communism in fact the name reagan '' itself only appears a dozen or so times in other words it is rarely cited and then usually in the manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do reagan 's speech at the berlin wall is not even mentioned something hard to fathom in an history of postwar europe eventually the streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight but it should not be concluded that it was american encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their eastern europe 's liberation '' 631 and then later equally bluntly despite the narrative that has entered the american public record washington did not down ' communism communism imploded of its own accord '' p 659 really who would have thought that forty years of american effort in the cold war was just a waste of time this proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of america and specifically of the american taxpayer in postwar europe america paid for europe 's reconstruction marshall plan america paid for europe 's welfare states by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense and also in the form of endless credits and loans america paid for europe 's economic prosperity by bankrolling the agencies which funded it such as the imf world bank and by opening american markets to european goods while allowing european markets to remain subsidized and protected something that is still the case today from agriculture to airbus and finally it was america who paid for the soviet 's defeat without america modern europe would not exist yes it is undeniable that communism rotted from the inside but rot by itself does not cause collapse otherwise how to explain north korea a thugocracy that survived even the death of the former such states continue to exist indefinitely until given a push and so to answer judt 's own question the reason communism collapsed when it did was because america pushed ronald reagan reversed american policy and stood up to the soviets and did so at a time when the major western european states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement thatcher 's uk excepted it had nothing to do with the helsinki accords judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy they are simply wrong it is a pity judt fails here the fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up the european response the lesson is that you must stand up to bullies appeasement in all its guises rapprochement ostpolitik engagement detente scheming or carter 's endless vacillation inevitably leads to failure and when the bill finally comes due as it always does then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life this was true in munich in 1938 and it remains true today given the current state of the world we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now there are numerous errors and omissions mostly minor iceland is missing from the cover maps occasionally more significant for example there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by american hedge funds against the weak european currencies did much more than just blow england and italy out of the erm in 1992. they also forced a hugely embarrassing french devaluation in 1993 in the form of widened intervention bands and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy major changes in how these governments governed the attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the euro as a collective defense against george soros but any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions in fact the strength of postwar is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics although weakened by the lack of source citations it is in the work of collecting data that judt succeeds it is in the work of interpreting those data that he fails for example toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the balkans following the break up of yugoslavia judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar europe the slaughter at srebrenica in which 7400 muslims were murdered under the noses of dutch soldiers serving under un command he then goes on to contrast the situation when nato took over at which point the slaughters promptly stopped and ten years of peace ensued enduring to this day surely this is something to which you would ask why the answer is simple the un force as is usual with un forces was too small had a weak and compromised mandate was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement but the nato force tolerated no nonsense they came in with the intention of standing up to the serbs and had the roe to do it the serb ' if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term promptly collapsed same lesson bullies must be stood up to perhaps it is the fact that the force was which prevented judt from seeing this at the time of writing the un is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue this time in lebanon and darfur a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it as seems all but inevitable right now what a sorry institution the un has become ! judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent something usually missing from accounts other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly marxist sartre and camus were predictable foucault less so a substantial presence in france but more or less unknown in america judt appears to come from the political left himself but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of foucault which can be summed up deep as follow the power '' in foucaultian terms the discourse of dissent which judt claims collapsed communism was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time he would have said look not at the surface look at the constellations a favorite foucaultian term of power any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in europe in 1989 would center on the united states and might still do so today despite a united germany an expanded eu and the absence of the soviet threat in explaining the collapse of communism historical roads as diverse as empirical rationalism or even great man theory all lead to the same place america but according to judt washington had nothing to do with it by the final chapters any pretense of objectivity has been lost was not a watershed horror for the free world but a passing american event that by implication the us deserved for its middle eastern policy of all european leaders since 1945 judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for stalin or tito or ceausescu but for tony blair why blair supports american policy '' blindly '' of course in summing up what judt thinks binds europeans together it is contrast with american ' way of life ' 748 lastly not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to american readers there is an overabundance of smug english circumlocutions and it was not for nothing '' not perhaps terribly '' and the like meaningless modifiers such as more than a little '' and decidedly '' are used ad nauseum so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words judt could learn from the great english historians of the past of whom there are plenty from gibbon to churchill there is in postwar none of their directness of language that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose noble in conception and majestic in scope it is what makes reading them such a pleasure whatever they have to say reading judt is just a chore in the end this book for all its size is just a sour little pamphlet an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain it is the written equivalent of those old photographs of soviet leaders gathered atop lenin 's tomb on may day in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out except that in postwar it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing postwar is not even bad history it is just propaganda dressed up as scholarship it should sell well in france
much as i admire judt 's writing and breadth of knowledge i 'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography which are relegated to a website i imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers
these earlier shorter stories are rather flat and do n't stand up to tomine 's later work collected in summer blonde '' tomine works best when he has the time and space allotted to really build his characters and the short stories herein do not allow for it as simply a portrait of a developing young artist sleepwalk and other stories '' is somewhat interesting but certainly not a fully realized or especially enjoyable book
after reading the reviews of the book i expected much more the really just whets your appetite with generalities about the internet or globalization summarized from the version one could get far more from a typical article in fortune business week etc the version is 9 pages of about 14 font text i guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book i would still like to read the version but i would advise avoiding the version
i 'm not really a big of grant morrison 's work i find a lot of his work to be the kind of stuff i thought up and then decided does have enough depth to carry it in a story with that said invisibles takes the cake when it comes to that while it may be different that does n't mean it has any depth if you 're a fan of morrison 's go do yourself a favor and read the seven soldiers trades or his arkham asylum stuff but stay away from the invisibles
long ago a friend who raved about the invisibles '' loaned me this first book i do n't have very clear memories of it but i remembered it as being very hard to read and i remember not getting very far in it before i lost interest recently due specifically to the influence of warren ellis 's awesome series planetary '' i 've gotten interested in comics again and decided to give the invisibles '' a second try i got a little further this time but still did n't even make it past the first volume the story seems promising big brother is watching so make yourself invisible '' the eponymous team are a gang of sorcerors fighting the mundane system of everyday life and the sinister otherworldly monsters who control the mundane system of everyday life the execution however is less than ideal most of the pages are very jarringly on one page the characters will be in a park listening in on a conversation and then on the next page where you expect to find a continuation of the conversation they were listening to they 'll suddenly be walking along a riverbank in the middle of their own completely different and unrelated conversation on almost every single page i had to turn back and check the page numbering to make sure i had n't accidentally skipped something or pages had n't fallen out of the book if it were n't for the sequential page numbering i would have assumed i was reading a bad printing this could be a clever technique if used sparingly in a comic book about hacking reality '' throwing in a sudden and unexpected jump cut '' between two pages can contribute greatly to the reader 's immersion in the reality hacking '' but when it 's done on every other page it loses that hook and just feels sloppy like the author and artist did n't know how to structure a comic one of the page cuts '' jumps from the beginnings of a fairly realistic fight scene to a psychedelic scene in which a character is tripping out and talking to the ghost of john lennon which looks like a completely different comic has completely different pacing and artwork and is filled with meaningless text which brings us to my next problem with the invisibles '' there 's way too much meaningless text if you want to present a radical concept in your comic that 's great try to do it with action as much as possible and with as few words as possible this is a visual medium after all if you need to throw in a few wordy bits that 's ok too planetary '' again does a perfect job of this if however you are filling entire pages with text so small that you have to go below standard comic font size and it becomes illegible then you might want to your medium and perhaps just write a book or a really wordy animation instead it was after the third entire page of nothing but handwritten meaningless text that i gave up on the invisibles '' and by meaningless '' i do n't mean fluff dialogue that pertains to the action '' or cryptic dialogue that might make sense later '' i mean actually meaningless gigantic of insane characters singing entire songs and babbling incoherently about things that have nothing to do with the plot or meaningless stream of consciousness droning from characters who are tripping all of this text feels like nothing but filler and coupled with the jarring transitions between pages it makes the invisibles '' look like very amateur work one last niggling detail is that i could n't really identify with any of the characters the main character a teenage boy named dane '' is basically a of alex from a clockwork orange '' but without the interest in beethoven he wanders around london with his droogs '' indiscriminately stealing cars smashing windows beating people up and blowing up buildings it 's suggested that he 's very smart but this does n't make him any more likeable the hook '' is that he sees dead people '' which might 've been clever when this series was first printed but after the sense '' bleach '' and a dozen other stories with i see dead people '' protagonists it just seems i really wanted to get the same sort of reality warping '' experience out of the invisibles '' that some of my friends have but i 've seen it done better a dozen times before and the whole execution just seems amateur when i stopped reading it i was hungry for some real reality warping so i sat down and read some stories out of the collected fictions of jorge luis borges and felt much better i suggest you skip the invisibles '' and do the same addendum the friend who last loaned it to me told me that the first two story arcs were indeed horrible but that it got significantly better after them i tried reading it again skipping over those first two story arcs and starting from the third and it was indeed a much better read and nothing was lost in having not read that first part so i 'm upgrading my review to a fun read overall but not something i 'd be interested in owning ''
if you are a christian this book is n't for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god '' and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect '' kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god '' without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image '' he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world '' and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god '' the world is in sin the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped 4 million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why ''
i 've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks and i could n't wait to read dear john well there was no reason to rush it starts out okay but then just gets more and more depressing the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him instead of just pouting over her for most the book i can not wait for another nicholas sparks book but only because i want to know that he has n't lost his touch and that this novel was just a fluck
i have all of nicholas sparks novels and i can honestly say that this one left much to be desired i have also raved about nicholas sparks ' works to everyone however i do n't have much to rave about this time the book was too predictable although i have often figured out other story lines written by sparks but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had i am disappointed in the book and hope to see that nicholas sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines hopefully he can find time outside of coaching track to write another wonderful novel such as the notebook message in a bottle the wedding and the list goes on but stops at dear john
i have been a nicholas sparks fan and i was very disappointed with this book too predictable very depressing
this book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market unless you have big bucks and level ii quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky in the trading parlance i wish i had a short position on this book at its current price and could cover my short at the current used price ! save your money
i read kozol to actually be amused it saddens me to think that colleges force students to read books like these young minds take this at face value i am a native new yorker from brooklyn my parents were working class and we had no extras what i hate most about kozol is his obvious white guilt he never talks about personal responsibility it is just the city not taking care of the poor and needy that is the problem with most liberals they offer opinions work on the emotions of people and never offer solutions when mayor giuliani wanted welfare workers to work ie pick up leaves in the park there was a great when i was in college i worked cleaning up after to pay for part of tuition and i waited tables etc why should they not work if they are getting a check he also talks about how the suburbs spent more money per child in the school he never mentions what those parents in the suburbs spent each year on taxes there is a lot more i could write but i would be here all day take it from a native new yorker who worked as a teacher in the south plays on your feelings but in the end by portraying poor people as victims he gives people a way to blame the system '' and insults every hardworking person who has improved his or her life
peter lynch 's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success i used to believe things i read in books because a good publisher like simon and schuster would publish it i counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling i also avoided reading tealeaves '' like drawing trendlines on what i was actually concerned about the price of the stock ! now i make a living reading tealeaves '' and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up my suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like john murphys technical analysis of the financial markets start there then go on to learn more advanced ta i also like investor 's business it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand ibd i also swingtrade hold stocks for days sometimes longer
not all that useful really message is buy mutual funds ! '' in general since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market just buy index funds would be the best advice most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the ceo to go over the financials and confirm your valuation oh thanks peter what great advice gates your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares ''
this book is funny because of the writers comments mostly although there are a few times where you will be wondering how our parents or grandparents survived a lot of the time i found myself standing up '' for the advice because honestly a lot of it made sense when you think about the era for example they still teach us that newspaper can help with delivering a baby if there are not better materials available it is worth a read if you have an hour to kill but i probably would not purchase it again since reading it once is enough
this book fails both as a history or analysis of yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of tito the first few chapters which contain an overly compressed historical '' review of the south slavs from the middle ages to the twentieth century contain factual spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable for example west claims that the leader of the 1573 croat peasant revolt was donja stubica '' that was actually the name of the village in which it started he claims that in 1871 the croat revolutionary eugen kvaternik led an armed assault on the serbs '' when in fact kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the habsburg monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves serbs he persistently misspells the surname of the great serbian linguist and writer vuk karadzic as ' and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text west basically argues that the problems in yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the middle ages and reduces the wars which ensued after yugoslavia 's collapse to religious conflicts he also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the serbs croats or bosnian muslims rather he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between ' and ' among other things he focuses extensive attention and invective perhaps rightfully to the croatian ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the croatian catholic church during this period on the other hand he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the serbian chetniks during the same period even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the serbian orthodox church was never clearly associated with great serb nationalism or with the chetniks '' one of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on world war ii the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the this is only true to a certain extent but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital ensuing years in fact at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in croatian and serbian newspapers during the late and early which speak of events from 50 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday west 's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to rather outrageously twice refer to the kosovo albanians as ' among this is a racial epithet not a neutral descriptive term tito the central figure in this book fares little better although west has a nostalgically favorable view of tito he offers no new insights into yugoslavia 's president and strongman only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies memoirs and histories both favorable and critical often he provides details on completely trivial matters from tito 's life at one point even citing actor richard burton 's impressions of tito and his wife aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in yugoslavia there is little of interest here reading west 's book is a colossal waste of time my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on tito and the ustasha terror and the former yugoslavia in general
the biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming i thought i was buying a book about knitting but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions
i did not buy this book for the designs should and they are not the point of the book anyhow i bought it to review the technical information for my knitting classes which according to some other knitting teachers was first rate and unbiased in this book instead on page 24 this supposedly and unbiased author lets creep in a definite intolerance towards continental purling saying it takes quite a contortion '' and refers to being blocked by the difficult maneuver '' while she does say in boldface everyone should knit however they want just a few pages earlier why then include the various slams against continental purlers it is simply another way to knit and i am not the only one who does not find it contortious or difficult at all the other reason i do not give more stars to this book is that the information given is really nothing new zimmermann 's several offerings include all of the technical information of this tome including the discussion of how the stitch is mounted leading whatever you wan na call it these days and have some truly beautiful classic designs to boot if you 're looking for good coverage of knitting technique you 'll do much better with any of the zimmermann classics
i found this book very depressing anne lamott 's constant throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well i know she is doing it to show that she 's human just like the rest of us but i think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets saying the version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman etc despite what she says about how you should n't do that it 's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models it gets to you this is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers i am not a writer but i am interested in writing and i would very much like to write fiction but i have a lot of trouble writing authentically lamott sends the message that as long as you 're a writer as long as you 're in our secret little club everything will be okay ! ''
my first nora roberts ' book only be persistent did i complete the book it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline shallow characterizatio
this is one of the only books by nora roberts i can actually say i didnt like it was so dissapointing i got mad everytime i looked at it this books is about oliva and noah the end that is practically what it is it started off when they were both younger them meeting when they were older and them meeting yet again when they are mature i guessed the story right from the beginning and i hardly could ever do that before in any of nora robert 's books i hate to say it but i dont reccomend this book it was really waste of time what happened to the quality work of roberts
the books are in fine condition my problem is with amazon ! i will never buy text books on amazon again ! waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days not just one book but 5 out of 8 that i ordered never never again !
there was hardly any mention of pixel the cat it was alot of dialog tried to resemble a fast paced action book but i found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while a female i like action and for the plot to move along was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging and multiple partner felt like the over tone to the book was well ok we all have alot of sex with lots of different people in the future '' it was too focused on that i liked stranger in a strange land '' alot better by the time i was through with this book i kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page
the first of this book are great a great heinlein thriller with action and mystery then it just gets weird almost as if douglas adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off
this book is terrible rah takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into well i do n't quite know what halfway through the book it seems as though he had set it down for several years came back to it to finish it off but had nothing but nonsense on the brain i 've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before but this book absolutely takes the cake it 's not even my book and i threw it in the trash so it wo n't waste another person 's time ever again
first off starship troopers is one of my top ten books period well done mister heinlein this book in a word ugh ! the dialogue is laughable at times noxious at others and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining sometimes it is none of those and at one point it 's shocking and nauseating main male character former military officer is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book until you suddenly find out he 's bisexual around page 300. and had a homosexual experience he did n't find unpleasant with a boy scout leader when he was a kid thanks for springing that on us just before the end bottom line do not recommend but starship troopers get 2 copies one to read one to lend out
reading the title and description of this book i was excited about reading it i found the writing not up to the task ! despite having a great deal of interest in the subject after scanning the book i decided not to read it
i bought this because im a zombie wish i saved my main character is a guy who is a cop and his wife is carrying some other guys they actually stop jumping in and out of bed with each other the battles with the zombies is quit of all places to build a new life they try to do it in a sex and more action this story desperately a good zombie movie with your ten bucks instead of buying this garbage
i wavered awhile between three stars and two stars because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as sony and akio morita seem to deserve at least three however in the end the book 's errors just piled too high it opens well with the story of sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a department store just after world war ii to becoming one of the world 's great companies this is a fascinating and inspiring story and morita tells it with flair then unfortunately the downward spiral begins morita consistently takes his experience at sony and assumes that every other japanese company operates the same way which is a fantastically wrong assertion as the last thirteen years of japan 's seemingly endless recession have shown he also frequently takes good basic management techniques like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely japanese '' then there are all the claims which are simply false such as japan supposedly having the world 's best construction technology it actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world as the kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated or how japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything yet it only recently discovered the concept of goods '' instead of throwing furniture and clothing away plus japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world 's worst overpackaging reading between the lines a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that japan faces today for example morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the united states while this can of course sometimes be a serious problem it also gives consumers a way to protect themselves japan 's consumers on the other hand without an accessible court system are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored because they lack any threat of legal action in another example morita praises the trust '' and agreements without contracts that exist among japanese corporations in reality this trust '' is a death pact as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs other than the glimpses into sony 's history and corporate culture this book is only interesting as a museum piece yet another in the flood of japan is going to take over '' books that came out in the eighties although of course considering all the internet companies are going to take over '' books that came out in the nineties not even this is a uniquely japanese '' phenomenon ps anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of japan should read dogs and demons '' by alex kerr
this has to be the most boring book i have ever read well i have n't quite finished it yet as it 's taking forever to push my way through it and i 'm sure that more boring books exist i just have n't read them i wanted to learn about kkr and lbos particularly as a division of kkr recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer i was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes but this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved there really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information and a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material it felt a bit like watching someone else 's home video it probably means a lot to the people involved especially as they 'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants but it 's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness i 'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway people do n't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years what are remembered are broad brushstrokes and this is what the author should have written there are occasional moments of entertainment like ted forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds but most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting the fact is i wanted some of this information in this book as it provided some of this albeit with a lot of suffering on my part i 'll give it two stars update well i did finish this book eventually my final opinion is much the same
i bought this for two reasons because i wanted to learn about lbos and because i had heard that the journalism was good and was hoping for something like 'the right stuff ' the cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed ' writing and 'all the suspense of a thriller ' the last is true only if your expectations of a thriller reach no higher than michael crichton the writing is a plodding 'you are there ' pastiche of the new yorker gulfstreams are sleak ceos are silver maned are bantams lawyers look like they model for gq etc investment bankers bark curse are struck by inspiration work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level stan lee would scorn i finally realised after slogging through the first 200 pages or so that 'barbarians at the gate ' is in large part essentially porn for aspirational middle managers there is in this book whom i would want to know unless i were a sociologist but i do n't even trust the sociology because the psychology is so superficial i did learn something about the process of lbos and for that a star is in order i did n't particularly enjoy learning it
if you 're thinking of reading this book let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy really and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners but this book in perfectly plain english sucked there is no plot no beginning middle or end and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
i 've read great reviews about this book so i finally bought it because i could not get it at my local library never ever finished the book it was badly written incoherent story it jumped around just plain
criticism i doubt that i have ever met any girls sillier than jane or more cloying than anthea indeed i have never met any more cowardly than the two of them put together they fulfill the worst stereotypes of silly little girls and i balk at having them be heroines in this story they cry and worry at their brothers for trying to fight if they want to stop the boys in the long run they should learn to speak sensibly or let the boys go to it and be beaten up a few times instead of snivelling for mercy to the enemy nesbit 's narrator has some humorous moments but is too much of a prude to run with them retreating instead into lectures on child behavior summary five children meet a called a psammead who is by far the most sensible of the characters in this book from there the book devolves into a series of events in the and then this happened and then that happened '' style counter recommendations for elementary age fantasy try any roald dahl james and the giant peach '' is quite marvelous as are witches '' and bfg '' also try cornelia funke 's inkheart '' or if lengthy books are still a bit daunting thief lord
just finished reading this novel this morning and i think it is probably the weakest one of the lot like a lot of reviewers i did n't find this one anywhere near as gripping or plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the stephanie plum series as well the supposed sexual love triangle between stephanie joe and ranger is approaching its date it is definitely becoming boring and i think ms evanovich needs to resolve stephanie 's romantic situation once and for all i still enjoy characters like lula and grandma mazur but a lot of the situations stephanie found herself in fell flat with me there are only so many times she can have her car blown up handbag destroyed apartment broken into etc before it becomes tiresome and repetitive i still think there is a spark of life in the stephanie plum series but i hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much as this one
this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention keep you enthralled and refuse to let you stop reading i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is but it 's because how good everything is until the very end that 's right the incredible of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel this is deus ex machina '' in its finest form this is unexcusable in my opinion i just do n't get it i just do n't understand how one can seemingly work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages i gave it two stars as opposed to one for fooling everyone into reading through this book this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
it 's probably been 15 years since i read it and every person in the years since with whom i have discussed this book has said the same thing it was literally a book that kept me up until 3 and that is how it ends i 'm hoping crichton had a publishing deadline or something
this 1987 thriller focuses on norman johnson a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget once the team is taken to the navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances that the navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology labels and directions are even written in english leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is the suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile this novel is quite predictable just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby that the undersea environment will become threatening there will be many deaths there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on while there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment crichton is capable of so much more if you are a fan read it but be forewarned if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this
just read the previous review about 'simplifying ' the language in jungle book i am reading the original text jb to my eight year old son for over a week now and he 's not once indicated that the language puzzles him he did ask me why mowgli uses thee and thou and wouldst while talking with the animals but accepted my explanation without demur reminds me of the lines from an elinor wylie poem '' our mutable tongue is like the sea curled wave and shattering dangle in strings of sand shall he who smooths the ripples out of it '' say it out loud and feel what it does to your mouth and face that 's what kipling 's prose does
the jungle book great illustrated classics malvina vogel adaptation totally agree with previous review how dare she ! it was my only thought when i opened the jungle book great illustrated classics how dare she to take the gorgeous nobel prize winning language and replace it with her bloody nonsense ! and put the kipling 's name on the cover does she think children for whom this book apparently meant are primitive morons think again miss vogel think again
republicans lose an election and what do they do they go right back to the stupid practices that got them kicked out of office yes republicans have gone back to talking about god taking the moral high ground against the secular evil left '' never mind illegal immigration the trade policies which forfeit our national sovereignty never mind america 's loss of credibility and allies in the world my republican party has abondoned its core principles espoused by barry goldwater which focused on a smaller role for government national sovereignty and fiscal responsibility speaking as a republican it looks like my party is bound and determined to stay the minority party forever and to become a willing accompliss in putting hillary in the white house

this propaganda is by a guy who tried to impeach clinton while he himself had an affair on top of that gingrich tried to pass a bill that would give the death penalty to pot smokers people who brought 40 grams of weed with them over the border talk about crazy this guy should n't be in politics he should be in a siberian labor camp he like all christian fundamentalists should just take his bible and his 'lord baby jesus ' and shove it deep up his because the rest of the country really does n't want to hear the bells of theocracy anymore do we really want to put our nation in the hands of this antiquated nihilistic jesus myth i think not again this is n't the 'united states of lord baby jesus ' and we as a nation should do everything in our power to prevent it from becoming so it 's also important to realize that our founding fathers were not christian they were deists which is akin to today 's agnosticism george washington 's practice of christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a christian he repeatedly declined the church 's sacraments never did he take communion and when his wife martha did he waited for her outside the sanctuary even on his deathbed washington asked for no ritual uttered no prayer to christ and expressed no wish to be attended by his representative here are some of the many quotes by our founding fathers john adams this would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it '' the divinity of jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity nowhere in the gospels do we find a precept for creeds confessions oaths doctrines and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in christianity '' thomas jefferson i do not find in orthodox christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology '' christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law '' benjamin franklin lighthouses are more helpful than churches '' the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason '' i looked around for god 's judgments but saw no signs of them '' in the affairs of the world men are saved not by faith but by the lack of it '' thomas paine i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all '' all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit '' the study of theology as it stands in the christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authority it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of no conclusion '' save yourself the money and do the research yourself the proper role of a government is to remain agnostic and remember our founding fathers did not believe in jesus
do not expect much of an wisdom here the book has enough material for maybe a one page pamphlet the rest is war stories without beginnings or endings it also would have been better to leave the reading to native speakers only
funny that a book about execution does n't get it accomplish the authors have a lot of experience and i am sure are good at leading and executing however the book does not get to the point the authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas
if you think you 'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting then you 'll enjoy this book
i was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing in an advice o'the day '' format of tidbits of wisdom the wisdom offered is good mind you but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you eg on a long car ride you will likely be disappointed i can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before i lose interest
i got this book at the library interloan and i have to say this is dead last in financial self help books if you have the time and inclination by all means go ahead and read it but i would recommend many books before this millionaire next door richest man in babylon think grow rich how to win friends and influence people anything by william nickerson or john reed or stephen king for that matter honestly after reading books on financial freedom this book has the dubious distinction of a singular ' moment i realized that if this guy can write a book like this anyone can in short do n't bother the 3 hours it takes from your life would be better off with your kids your pets or your dentist come on you know you need it alternatively buy it yourself if for no other reason that encouraging the author in you but please do n't take my word for it
i was appalled at the lack of editing the poor grammar and the number of typos in this book perhaps others could overlook it i was constantly distracted and therefore found it difficult to muster any respect for the author in addition i felt that it was written for a rather uneducated audience for folks who could n't analyze and think for themselves the conversations of the characters were overstated in general the concept of the book was ok not spectacular but the format was undigestible
when i opened this order i was totally surprised i thought someone had made a mistake and sent me some advertising literature i have actually received bigger and better free '' info from advertisers this is listed as a 16 page book but is just a 12 page brochure do n't waste your money making the writers of this book richer
this was possibly the worst use of my money ever learned nothing new well maybe i did learn that i 'm already as good a leader as some of my peers and a better leader than most since i found the practices '' in this short pamphlet can hardly call it a book to be no more than common sense
this is a promotional piece for kouzes ' and posner 's books and leadership practices inventory a questionnaire about leadership written in the breathy style of literature a true if you are interested in their work buy the leadership challenge 1997 which has the same editorial tone but at least says something
some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel '' sambuco '' is actually ravello on the amalfi coast until recently the home of gore vidal the movie being filmed in the village was beat the devil directed by john huston and starring humphrey bogart in the book bogie is the obnoxious drunk burnsie cass kinsovling 's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old caruso belvedere the atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of the talented ripley another tale of americans in italy in the 1950 's for all of styron 's fine writing this is something of a period piece the moral crisis that is at the heart of the book the fantastic going to pot '' of americans in the period is not of much concern to anyone today nat turner and sophie 's choice are styron 's masterpieces may he rest in peace
i see all the people here like this book but i do n't get why the first half is unpleasant though intriguing styron seems to think it is interesting for characters to rant eccentrically about whatever is on their mind but i would disagree and i soon started skipping all rants the story is intriguing and for a while the book was kind of interesting as we see the naive narrator come to see the truth of his pretentious friend half way through the book becomes fairly unreadable as it changes focus to a different character this begins with an entire chapter of the sort of rant that i found so unpleasant and then proceeds through a tedious accounting of an unpleasant and dull tortured artist type i tried reading this for a while but it was so annoying that i just skimmed the second half to see how everything was tied up which it was in a perfunctory fashion i suppose this is good for styron fans i 've never read any of his books before and certainly never will again
i picked up this book after seeing david sedaris on a late night talk show he seemed hilarious almost like a younger bemused woodie allen type while the book is well written his views on life are very disappointing to me in his previous of life he was a a loafer well basically a bum many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives these folks were getting in the way of david 's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs he can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and ca n't put enough blame on those around them
winchester takes an interesting subject collects enough material to make a fine article in say national geographic and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length case in point a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid but loses it and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss ick boring worse still even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material such as relates say to the subject 's wife all winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations i guess extensive research might have been too time consuming numerous times i considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going hence my review of two stars john mcphee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than winchester and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story
i am disappointed with this author there is too much theory to wade through versus application i wish all of these doctor authors could use wayne dyer as the example if this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter filled with applications and a good review then i would have given this author a or a which would of been four or five stars
i felt it was very scientific and difficult reading i was n't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although i am sure by the title it has great information in it i do n't feel it 's for the average person more medical scentific minds truthfully i feel my money was wasted and wish i would of took the time to return it
after finishing the first predictable repairman jack novel i tried this sequel for light reading wow ! stupidest book i have read in years ! talking monkeys aliens the others the oness and other nonsense put it down and donated to the library utter drivel if i wrote this crap i 'd be very ashamed
there are plenty of excellent play therapy books out there this is not one of them maybe it 's just me but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly i need quick access color and art
i was thoroughly impressed with buchanan 's witty prose and charming dilect he is obviously skilled in spinning a good yarn '' for his audience the dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same for instance i love my country but i think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures america is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy it is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego 's democracy is what we are founded on not capitalism in my opinion freedom must be enjoyed by all not just the rich elite someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like buchanan will be the instigators people that have everything yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance how did the get the power in this country by taking it rudely and loudly that is what minorities in this country need to do speak loudly and make the country hear their voices just like whites have done for centuries
this book is very comprehensive which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background as someone who knew nothing about islam prior to reading this book i was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that lapidus has arranged as you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book it is very wordy like most history texts it is also very dry and devoid of emotion the author does however provide a complex view of islam that is fair and accurate
this is my first review mainly because it 's the only one where i found my perspective to be dramatically different than the other reviewers i bought the audio version based on the reviews i read on line and was looking forward to reading a new author what i found is a book that is full of cliches and choppy dialogue although it 's a very quick read i found myself frustrated with the ridiculous dialogue and characters that failed to keep my interest i must confess that i did find myself laughing out loud at some of the very bad cliches i will qualify my review by stating that this was an audiobook and i found the reader to be very poor using accents for different characters that were wildly exaggerated it could be the reader 's characterization that amplified the poor writing needless to say i will not be reading any other swain books
after having read the book i was left with a mixed feeling the content of the book is not special just if this book changed your way of thinking about risk then this is probably one of your first books you read on the subject i give the book content 4 stars since it 's decent easy to follow and fairly complete besides that the author included three good articles at the end of the book one of which by caroline hamilton is particularly now for the style i can only agree with one of the other reviewers regarding the comment he made about proofreading the book i wonder if the book was proofread at all there are so many errors and annoyances in this book it starts working on my nerves fairly quickly to name but a few the writer contradicts himself on several occasions sometimes this gets hilarious page 30 the analysis is the most important step of any risk analysis process page 35 as discussed in the previous example the scope statement is the most important element of the risk analysis process page 39 the most important element of any risk analysis process is the recommendations of controls and safeguards etc etc i understand that mister o'leary is his mentor but do n't tell me five times that he is the director of the education resource center pages ix 12 13 65 66 the spelling errors are a real pain in the butt page 217 aurebach '' instead of auerbach '' my favorite it 's his own publisher page 16 can shared '' instead of can be shared '' page 36 '' instead of appropriate '' page 43 their role '' instead of his role '' page 45 control '' instead of risk '' last word on the page page 46 these '' instead of there '' page 47 guideline '' instead of guidelines '' page 55 their '' instead of its '' it refers back to job '' page 64 wrong comma usage page 71 in '' instead of it '' page 162 originizational '' instead of organizational '' page 217 ozierz 's '' instead of ozier 's '' the writer uses the and too many times definitions should be reworded not blindly copied see pages 7 and 57 pages 47 and 72 etc sometimes bulleted items in the same list have a trailing dot sometimes they have n't i can go on and on to wrap it up the writing gets 1 star equals 5 stars which will be rounded to 2 stars simply because of his sloppy writing if the writing were better i might give it 3 or 4 stars
john ashcroft has written a book detailing his job as attorney general for president george bush 's first term the title 'never again ' refers to his feelings for the political bent he brought to the position whereby he was as much an extension of the white house as any other administration appointee the title also refers to his reaction to the attacks the attacks he determined that commercial air travel was too dangerous for the top law enforcement official in the land in this case 'never again ' refers to taking doj jets for all transportation at least he could be safe it may also reference his atempts to help the administration blame everyone but themselves for the attacks irrespective of the fact that the president was warned on 6 2001 george tenet cofer black and separately ricard clarke tried to warn the administration what could possibly happen as a result of terrorist attacks in this country
far too religious for me i do not think this book presents a healthy way to respond to grief
robert miles aka simple investor has written the worst book about warren buffett imaginable i read all this when it first appeared on the berkshire chatter board was appalled at the following he developed i bought his book becase i am always interested in disasters miles may be the nicest man in the world but he is without doubt the worst writer the great thing about america is anybody can be anything miles wanted to be a writer he is yes indeed barnum was right ! i wish the rating system went to minus 5. the worst thing is now miles has written a second book i must buy it to see if he remains the world 's worst writer sincerely mik
carly 's book was ok '' she cries alot triumphs and blames many around her this one is definitely skippable
what a waste of time this was like sitting through a very boring business course i was never interested in turning the page i would have liked to see more of carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this i felt like a robot was telling this much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else i forced myself to finish this a huge n't waste your money
this woman put people out of work poor thing she got fired received a huge severance and a book deal now all she can think about is herself and how bad they did her i fell asleep reading it
this vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object 's future behavior people have many connections to a place which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations these emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and '' citizens for a long time to come in reading the book by the way the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern american style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends it 's much more in an old fashioned english amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it 's all sort of breezy some may like that
i should start this out by saying howard bloom is a genuis and i am a big fan but that is what makes this review harder for me to write everything that made the lucifer principle great makes global brain not so great the lucifer principle was entertaining and easy to read it was a rare book one that dealt with complex ideas but not in a way that was above the average joe this book read like a school textbook and one that you would read in grad school to boot another problem was that this book had no clear cut goals and those it did seemed to similiar to the lucifer principle stick with the lucifer principle and skip this
rieux the main character of the novel moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job '' while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague i find jose saramago 's blindess '' to be a far superior book to the plague similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving the plague was clinical in its approach almost bloodless i found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to often having to many pages over and over i would pass on this book
i admit it i saw this on a library cart and assumed from the cover that this was some political humorist on the order of o ' rourke or jon stewart who had simply not come to my attention how wrong i was greg palast bills himself as some kind of investigative reporter he is not he is a partisan who puts together a tidbit here a tidbit there and fills in the blanks with cant taken from the talking point memos of a thousand fringe groups and special interests what does n't fit in with his agenda is simply ignored where a fact '' is vitally necessary it is often invented palast does n't document his secret '' finds much like seymour hersh another investigative reporter '' palast expect you to accept on his own authority that when he tells you of this or that secret document that has come into his possession you are to believe simply because he says it is so ipse dixit as the latin goes the basic themes are what you would expect to find in any progressive '' screed the united states is evil bush is evil and dumb big corproations are evil and greedy there are secret cabals that rule the united states and want to dominate the world and would were it not for a few freedom fighters '' who blow up innocent women and children and so forth we 've all heard it ten thousand times and its no more rational coming from palast than it is from someone else two examples will suffice to show the blatant dishonesty of greg palast first is palast 's defense of dan rather 's use of forged documents palast without evidence not only rejects the argument but attacks the people cbs brought in to examine the entire fiasco no evidence just blast next is palast 's attempt to misrepresent the work of king hubbert a geologist on oil reserves even though he reproduces hubbert 's original chart palast simply distorts hubbert 's conclusions overall palast simply plays to the crowd those who share his beliefs no proof is needed to support his contentions as long as he casts the united states as evil and so on all will be well and his books will sell well since the people who read them are not interested in truth but in having their already existing beliefs reinforced jerr
when you have lost weight it 's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off whenever they have heard me tell my story read my blog or book or found out that i did it on the lifestyle one question invariably has come up from time to time '' what do you think about this diet where you can eat whatever you want for per day '' my initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this '' that 's absolutely crazy ! there 's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method '' i did the atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other diets out there but there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it little did i know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about it 's called the carbohydrate addict 's diet and it was written by a team drs richard and rachael heller the cad diet as it is referred to makes the claim and i agree with it that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less that same concept is what goes into the cad diet if people think the atkins diet is restrictive then check out what you have to do on the cad diet breakfast meal consisting of protein and fat lunch meal consisting of protein and fat you are not allowed to eat any bread fruit milk juice and most starchy vegetables absolutely no snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda you can not use artificial sweeteners either sound appealing anyone hmmm i suppose if that 's all there was to this diet then nobody would do it but there is one more key aspect of the cad diet that you probably will be interested in dinner eat equal amounts of protein vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount but it must be eaten in a time frame you can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your reward '' meal how 's that for incentive you basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line ! who would n't enjoy a diet that lets you do that ! well i 'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a daily basis i caught a lot of flack from my fellow about my controversial planned splurge '' meal every weeks during my weight loss however the hellers give you a daily planned splurge ! ! ! what 's up with that we can blame this on rachael who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet she became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat ostensibly to help herself in the process too she had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then like most of us would ate to her heart 's content whatever she wanted for supper the next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale she tried it again the next day skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again she lost another pound she played around with what would eventually become the carbohydrate addict 's diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day the frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the cad diet the hellers believe that anyone who consumes any amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether they say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict it will make them crave their poison even more ! that 's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the cad diet until the end of the day this process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one and the hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people i still ca n't get around the fact that you do n't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds sure they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one big meal each day but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success hunger ! there 's no way i could do the cad diet because i enjoy eating every hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion i truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off since you can not snack or use artificial sweeteners on the cad diet it would literally drive me insane even if there was that reward '' meal at the end of the day ! wan na take a test to see if you are a carb addict click here to take the carbohydrate addict 's test i scored a 2 which means you do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted '' no kidding ya think jonny bowden author of living the life examined the cad diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works while it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese it 's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin as the hellers hypothesize in fact the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response '' furthermore bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program stating it 's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate '' while the carbohydrate addict 's diet has worked for a lot of people and i always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off i still have my reservations about this program i think i 'll pass on my body for one hour a day
this book is just plain stupid if it works for people and helps them lose weight i realize they will be estatic however it is not healthy each of our meals should be balanced these people are promoting unbalanced eating the reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs ! if one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups including complex carbs in small amounts we would not only lose weight in a safe manner but we would heal our bodies from the inside out this diet wo n't heal us it is a fad if anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism lose weight and even heal disease try reading the schwarzbein principle '' by diana schwarzbein md that is a great book on how to heal diabetes hypoglycemia and many other things it also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place this book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss not getting healthy
after two weeks on this diet plan i could bearly lift my head up i nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights not to mention hardly staying awake while at work i thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of atkins but i was never tired on atkins i do n't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs or what the problem was all i know is i am happily following atkins and losing much more rapidly than i did on this cad plan in two weeks i lost 6 lbs on cad 14 on atkins you figure it out
excellent book ! terrible narration by mandvi i can not understand why he did not learn to pronounce the common indian names in the book was n't that the point of using an south asian narrator
as far as crime dramas go this is firmly mediocre the story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically but the author 's writing style is sometimes a distraction why do the suspects always ask for slice soda to drink and they repeatedly make a point of asking for slice do they even make it anymore i thought it was replaced by sierra mist and another distracting detail is the author 's way of giving so many people nicknames you do n't need to tell me that a guy 's name is ed smiley '' jones if you never mention smiley '' again or there 's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname that said i liked the use of dc as the backdrop and if i was going on a plane ride i would probably pick up another book by pelecanos but i would n't let anyone see what i was reading and then i 'd leave it in the seatback when i deplaned
i love to read and listen to books on cd but i have tried to listen to this a couple of times and i am disgusted the language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that i ca n't get past the second disc very disappointed
i was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel but i have no one else to blame but myself since i knew nothing about it before shelling out over 24 i should have been more on guard but i was n't what i found when i opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche a celebration of lame flabby banality a festivel of mediocrity nicely tarted up as a brainy cultural commentary '' an actual review quote the only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the knopf marketing department they deserve five stars the characters '' in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12. the dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins she ai n't no cummings i kept wondering if i had left the television on as i was reading this brainy cultural commentary but it was not on that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other this is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels up there with the historian by whatshername kostova do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with intelligence and velocity '' another quote from inside the dust jacket
after reading other reviews i expected an erudite flowing novel which would connect multiple worlds what i discovered was a complicated plot that does not make it easy for the reader to understand i do believe that if writing is too difficult to comprehend then is not clear writing and i wonder if the author really knows if she is presenting a ghost or love story of both if it is both it is confusing to me the action is wrapped around two cousins one successul and the victim of a childhood prank of the other loser adult cousin we are transported to a castle near prague where we imagine the successful cousin will finally have retribution egan spins a tale of blood lore based on family pride from this narrative she shifts to a maximum security prison where the characters are similar to the castle folk the creative writing teacher holly becomes a main character who has her own demons and finds a commonaility with a prisoner who is the same we are to believe as the loser cousin she does prove that escape is impossible and i wish i could have found some sanctuary if i understood what she really wanted to tell us
after completing my first year of law school i really wonder why so many professors use this textbook more than half the people i spoke with in my class thought the casebook 's usability was poor or worse property is not a difficult class aside from future estates and related issues rule against perpetuities the hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law and this casebook does only an ok job highlighting that it is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently additionally many of its cases are not sufficiently edited thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue my other case books are much more balanced on this issue as a last note the production quality is lower than what i would expect for its price the paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price i suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks simply stated
this is easily the worst casebook i have ever owned lousy for learning future interest and possessory estates lousy for learning mortgages lousy for learning adverse possession mainly lousy lousy lousy do n't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid you wo n't learn jack from it since it 's horribly written do n't buy this book purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses the print is practically microscopic i ca n't believe i have to suffer through another property course terrible book
despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site this is not a well written book i am speaking of the future interests section in particular in order explain concepts the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter and simply gives examples without clarifying i think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way but fail to do so this is evident once you use the gilberts outline written by dukeminier where concepts are well defined perhaps this is a ploy to sell more gilberts regardless the textbook leaves much to be desired
talk about a waste of time ! i was wondering if it was just me so i asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it it is boring tells you instead of shows you hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all i also found the protrayal of the grandmother 's flirtation with islam to be shallow unbelievable and ultimately dismissive do n't waste your time on this or your money luckily i had picked it up at a book sale for 0.25 about what it was worth
being a fan of such authors as tolkien wells and lewis i figured i 'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the american west a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining i did some research and cormac mccarthy seemed to be the author to start with he got very good reviews from this site and professional critics i find it amazing that he received such great reviews this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit the book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly unexpectedly return to it i have never read a book like that before after completing this book i had found out more about the life of a prostitute than i ever wanted to know and also i received a free lesson in swearing i understand that it was custom in the west to swear and dealings with prostitutes was common but i think mccarthy went over the top this made it uninteresting and redundant then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods question marks and exclamation marks i did not see a single quotation mark and the word and '' was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly sentences were monotonous after reading this book i also felt ignorant being uneducated in the spanish language much of the dialogue i could not understand in the least bit there were entire conversations written exclusively in spanish at times when it seemed relevant i felt like i missed a lot of important information in the story i did find that at time mccarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me i do n't suppose i 'll ever read a book by cormac mccarthy again
i bought this book as a high school senior looking to improve upon my already pretty good score on the sat reasoning my desire going into the test was simply to raise my score on the math section and keep the others around the same however what i discovered is that the first time i took the test without studying i fared better than i did with this book now i may have been setting my sights too high but this book promises an increase of about 100 points by using their special techniques what i found out however is that it did change my score by about that much but in the opposite direction ! ! i am thoroughly disappointed as i know that i 'm not stupid my application to rice university is already in and i 'm planning to apply to georgetown stanford duke and the university of california i certainly hope that this does n't jeopardize my standing with these colleges but please do n't think that this book is worth the money it 's not
this book might be good as a simple review for children interested in kennels i found it to be very simplistic and filled with a lot of common sense '' information if you are really interested in reading it check your local library it is just not worth the money
great motivator although i got really tired of the bashing also there are some serious oversights on her part go ahead and eat all the bagels you want if it works for you congratulations i wonder what new spin she 'll put on this stuff for her latest get rich scheme
like every other diet book out there her argument boils down to eat right exercise she 's a hypocrite she goes on and on about how evil the diet industry is and how she 's one of us because she was once fat fine great but half her arguements i 'm not buying no one fact checks books anymore also the book is still fixated on fat recently we learned that it is n't just fat that makes us fat look at a bag of sugar if i eat that will i not gain a pound it 's fat free great susan how do we stop the insanity first eat whatever you want as long as it 's health food second exercise third breathe i think this is just filler cuz she did n't have anything else to offer instead of starving ourselves we 're to go to a chart of how many calories we 're to expend a day that 's still cutting calories also lumping oa into the diet industry is wrong it 's not for profit taking people out for a walk instead of going to an oa meeting is like taking raging alcoholics out for coffee instead of attending an aa meeting a temporary solution to an underlying problem did n't susan later have some sort of substance abuse problem too methinks the lady doth protest too much she 's gotten all her little droogs to write raving comentaries on her book but who the hell has heard of susan powter in the last 10 years no one ! ! sa 's a flash in the pan here 's the scoop eat right and exercise now pay me a billion dollars cuz i 'm telling you the truth
after reading dim sum of all things i became a big fan of keltner 's work my biggest question was whether or not she would be able to break from the theme and writing style that worked so well for her in dim sum unfortunately the answer is no dim sum had a much better plot line and the small intricate stories she paints to animate her lindsey character worked so well together that the reader was compelled to believe they were in lindsey 's shoes in buddha baby the overall plot is at best weak keltner attempts to tell small stories of lindsey 's life but this time it does not work dim sum was a breath of fresh air with plenty of stories that asian people can especially identify with the moments where you wanted to laugh or cry out loud from experiencing moments exactly like lindsey are no longer there in buddha baby as an asian myself a lot of her stories hit home and i have yet to read any work of fiction or that even tries to explain much of what we face especially being of the 1.5 generation i have to hand it to keltner to even attempt such a feat i will forever cherish her lindsey character but her storytelling of lindsey 's asian and american character duality has run its course we barely get to see any this in buddha baby i will still read keltner 's next installment should she choose to continue it though that lindsey character she created is just wonderful
whole book rings false like dining at the olive garden and hearing cheesy dean martin songs played out of the speakers or going to lunch at a japanese restaurant where the diners are tourists and the only japanese people there are the ones that come just to see where the tourists eat dialogue seems one sided like she 's talking with herself even though it 's supposed to be with other people plot seems for lack of a better word pretty whack
this book has many wonderful reviews i ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it so i read it then read it again i didnt find much that is helpful to new writers certainly no ah hah ! '' moments gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me if you were lost in the amazon jungle would you want an indian to help you or someone who knows a lot about indians '' gardner knows a lot about writers ! this book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature very interesting book but what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery new writers are not tolstoy or dickens or balzac new writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly later they can soar
no wonder john gardner did n't write more fiction books he was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction rather than actually writing it creative atrophy '' i believe john gardner himself would call it if there 's ever been a better example of the those who ca n't do teach '' argument i have n't encountered it this is hardly the place a young writer '' should start instead how about reading what you like and avoiding ignoramouses '' such as john gardner john gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world 's finest writers never made it through college and many more did n't have the luxury of a rigorous classical education '' the most hilarious part is where gardner mentions that only through a university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy shakespeare it 's interesting to note how gardner who taught '' creative writing at the university level fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
clearly john gardner is a literary genius however not being one myself i found that his style was a little overbearing it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that i was looking for
this is a fairly helpful book for those born before the a time when a yarn '' was n't an archaic term does it give some helpful hints sure there 's the obvious ones like show do n't tell and all characters have free will but fiction has changed a lot since henry james thankfully and this book might be better left unread plus i do n't buy the only people who are n't do n't like it '' argument i 've read nearly all the books mentioned and i still wish i never bought this book
i guess albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but i 'm done with him at least i can say i never paid for any of his oprahlit just wasted time at a library please do n't make this huckster one cent richer buy something more edifying like toilet paper
i hate to be the 'dog in the manger ' on this one but i found this book very irritating not so much in that it 's a particularly badly written book it 's not but its incredible popularity is more an indictment of it 's fans rather than it 's creator mitch ablom books in general and for one more day '' in particular are popular for the same reasons mcdonalds olive garden celine dion and tom cruise are popular they provide a mass audience baby boomers in particular with a predictable easily digestable intellectually nonthreatening and utterly mediocre product for one more day '' is tailored to the worst in the whiny baby boomer generation as the boomers age they greet the almost universal midlife themes of dissapointment and regret as if they were the very first people to ever experience those emotions and make a huge deal of broadcasting and analyzing their feelings to death who does n't reach middle age and not feel some regret that they did n't write the great american novel marry the homecoming or start a fabulously successful i guess with the baby boomers it 's a particularly bitter pill because they were brought up from the to believe they were mitch ablom has tapped this rich vein of boomer angst to great success his protagonist 'chick ' benetto is a ball player with a broken marriage and a drinking problem in a fit of he tries to kill himself and botches that one too he meets his dead mom acknowleges he has been a real poop and finds redemption cue the string section and loosen the tear ducts oh gag me ! ! ! ! even some of his 'novel ' plot devices are nothing new anyone who has read an incident at owl creek bridge '' by ambrose bierce will be spitting nails at ablom 's shameless cribbing of the books main twist the book itself is a childishly easy read ablom is no great artist with the english language and no one with greater than a reading ablily will be taxed by this one faulkner eco and melville can rest easy the baby boom generation has never been known for it 's intellectual horsepower and this book is for the oprah nation a lightweight tome for a lightweight society
building on running with scissors '' or dry '' you could easily feel that this book might have even more to offer about this author 's life however while i felt the stories were mildly amusing and burrough 's has a talent for sarcastic writing like bill bryson or mary roach this book i found overall chaotic and without merit why are n't the stories in chronological order at the very least what is the point of this book it seems almost as if you 're listening to a friend talk endlessly about himself with no regard for what you might like to hear or pay for there 's no cohesive bond to hold the stories together other than they are about the author perhaps it 's time for time for burrough 's to show a little versatility and less
denice and i grew up in the same small town in oklahoma it is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death this heinous crime not only shook ada but also shook those of us who grew up with her in purcell ok denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room she was a year behind me in school i recently pulled out a old high school annual looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories memories of a beautiful innocent young woman who 's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye as important as it is that justice has been served in this case it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget denice
you 'd be much better off to buy other volumes in the series this anthology is generally a page waste of time most poetry is consigned to oblivion for a reason ! what is here rescued is frankly not worth it and the literature '' here is of historical rather than intrinsic interest a monument to inclusivity '' and diversity '' but full of poor writing the common reader is here advised to invest in library of america 's wonderful volumes of the poetry of frost stevens whitman and whenever they finally appear in the future dickinson melville eliot and bishop
i truly enjoyed all of the other rich dad poor dad books but this one is awful i have recommended all of the books to a number of my close friends and family i will have to warn them all of this book you know you can knock them all out of the park though i still will recommend that everyone should read rich dad poor dad at the very least
i refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer did n't really write this i will try to describe him or her definitely a vegetarian possibly a member of peta dry writing style well crighton is dry even when he 's excellent it bothers me how many unrealistic characters crichton uses it seems every character in some of these books earned a phd from mit by 16 was an alternate on the olympic swim team a top researcher an accomplished pilot beautiful or handsome and wealthy these people do not exist in nature they also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete complex sentences quoting research in casual conversation but at least mc has a gift for crafting believable plausible much like isaac asimov but this is so beneath him i refuse to accept it
the introduction pretty well sums up the fatal flaw in this book but this book is n't a book it 's a book '' you have to ask how much good is knowing what to do if you do n't know how to do it go rebuild the engine in your car i told you what to do you will have to find out how to do it somewhere else save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else to begin with i bought this book to learn how to market my novels i get in this respect promotion novelists are luckier than nonfiction writers not much is expected from them in the way of promotion page 87 '' how much less none a little bit which ones of the 100 weapons '' should i use though i forced myself through the rest of the book and its interminably boring lists i never found the answer i will have to say the authors practise what they preach i would bet they have used all the gorilla my spelling weapons in this book and then some to sell every copy they can including i suspect many of the glowing reviews on this page from members of their network '' you push my book and i will push yours it is a shame that american literature has come down to who is the best marketer maybe that is why many new novels which used to keep me glued to my seat now get slammed shut after the first few chapters maybe the next one will be better this book is cotton candy real yummy but no substance sugar air the best part is the guarantee which the authors proudly proclaim is a safe bet because most people wo n't take you up on it i have to give it some credit for the appendixes of course you could get the same thing with a few simple internet searches but i hate to be all negative if you buy this book you may find yourself saying i 've been guerillaed ''
i purchased both this book and john kremer 's 1001 ways to market your book kremer 's book is far superior far more thorough and far more practical for authors buy kremer 's book and save your time and money i do n't recommend guerrilla marketing for writers
i was really disappointed in this book i had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book i struggled through and only finished since i bought it new and kept thinking i would find something redeeming in it
our entire book club disliked this book we had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters howard the largest presence in this story feels like a blank at the core upon putting this book down his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me characters such as jerome victoria and carl were intriguingly introduced but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text especially carl he just disappears no resolution to his story at all as am homage to howard 's end some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me for example the connection between kiki belsey and carlene kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between margaret schlegel and wilcox did i thought zora was one of the most interesting characters and i like how smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity but smith makes her smug a bit too often and so feeling a connection with zora is difficult as well most of the time i just wanted to smack her and i have to agree with the others that smith needs to brush up on her american characterizations there was next to no authenticity in that regard especially the southern dialogue laughable ! it also feels like smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book i understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling unresolved by the last page just gave me a feeling of aaaargh must go and howard 's end to dispell the queasy feeling left by on beauty
i waited for this book to come out in paperback and i am a fan of white teeth and although autograph man was boring i had high hopes for on beauty sadly this writer should stick to what she knows a visiting professorship does n't make her an authority on campus life in new england or what american kids say and do the assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author 's depiction and i found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling especially her stabs at boston and southern accents her british characters especially howard and v are well drawn and speak naturally reminiscent of white teeth they are believable her americans are laughably and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant brit might imagine them especially levi and carl the character zora modeled on the precocious author herself is not likeable at all the story of jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed he slides in and out of the story the furthermore her story line about campus politics is lackluster another reviewer references kingsley amis 's lucky jim i recommend richard russo 's excellent straight man for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept tenure backstabbing plots
it was just that dry and boring i never really connected with any of the characters i gave up reading about of the way through
does not live up to the hype no wonder he works with jakob nielsen same thinking structures '' erm nice idea seeds would fit into a four pager even with examples do n't buy this book the seven bullet items summarize all included much awrite about nothing
tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts '' or scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea '' provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture '' if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture '' based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period '' series see prophecy house 's web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items
this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that 's all she wrote folks there 's no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
first i listened to the unabridged audio edition its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel however what i do n't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees weeping invoking god and tearing their clothes the count voice of was ludicrous and painful to hear the endless discussions of hacking and reading lengthy sermons from judah and listening to chloe whine and buck cry i honestly can read no more i thought i could finish out this series but the desecration was the worst book i 've read in the series to date carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw what made this series the trials of an everyday joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a christian themed ludlum novel with buck and rayford traveling the globe to rescue christians who get killed anyway while ignoring their own families christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops if satan were as stupid as he 's portrayed in this novel eve would never have taken a bite from the apple frankly i finished this book hoping carpathia would whack rayford and the rest of the tribulation force they are so annoying and sanctimonious 2 stars
lewis exposed the circular reasoning in hume in the book miracles '' david hume was not a skeptic he was a freemason and therefore a gnostic he was only skeptical of nongnostic positions such as christianity he was an apologist for gnosticism he had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed his argument against miracles is his chief argument against christianity and it suffers from circular reasoning circular reasoning you exclaim yes hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience however if uniform experience is against mircales then they can not happen uniform experience is his presupposition but uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles if they did n't happen well they did n't happen this begs the question i have a better argument than lewis 's i would simply point out that pure logic can not dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen afterall mathematics is made up of tautologies as such mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning can not have physical meaning pure logic as hume employs can not tell us anything about the world therein lies the sophistry it boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic but on the existence of god who intervenes in human affairs as the former atheist antony flew said it is impossible to argue against the existence of god in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe if anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen food and other human necessities they would n't hesitate to posit a creator of that house so why would anyone question the existence of god in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives what is remarkable about him is how irrational he is he possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning yet he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda it 's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks he tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought hume was a strange man the engine is running but there 's no one behind the wheel
this book was not at all what i expected from brands who was a pulitzer prize finalist for his biography of benjamin franklin first american in trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public brands ' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial at one point when discussing relations he goes so far as to call the whites palefaces '' it was a chore to get through and while it heightened my knowledge of jackson nothing was particularly memorable except what i already knew or perhaps the actions i disagreed with his invasion of florida or his use of martial law after the battle of new orleans particularly when discussing jackson 's historically far reaching actions such as kicking the cherokees out of georgia or his battle with biddle and eventual destruction of the bank of the united states brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened elements of background and why jackson did whatever it was he did exactly as the reader will be confused on that point are conspicuously missing i have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by brands tr the last romantic and if first american is at all similar in style i know why he did n't win that pulitzer
the author is a journalist but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a think tank like business elites the author basically does not particularly like democracy in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas even authoritarians if needed he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism based on laws rights especially property rights separation of powers with much of that power being held in unelected bodies and most of all capitalism he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits most in the west do care rights and legal systems are not neutral the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment though the author 's real target is us society he looks at the results of democracy over the world and of course he finds plenty of examples where democracy does n't work a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us in the us the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years in actuality he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism in this era elites in finance business law banking health care various media etc have likewise been swept up in fact are the driving force in a culture he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at and the like represents democratic empowerment the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the juggernaut he especially decries direct citizen actions he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets however he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes it 's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late century and their heirs should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums if citizens had actually been democratically empowered such distortions of the political process could have been prevented the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late benefiting financial elites no rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy not buttressed it if the author put journalism first instead of being an apologist for century capitalism he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process actually foiling democracy first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system distorting and muting all challenging ideas it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as agreements worker visa programs massive immigration energy policies broken health care systems huge cutbacks in various safety net programs massive redistribution of wealth upwards the gutting of our manufacturing base etc the list could go on informed empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy but is in the throes of democratic failure which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book americans are supposedly fiercely democratic yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule even generals if need be the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment
i use the notebook '' and a walk to remember '' as optional films in my upper division sociology courses after hearing many positive student responses i was curious about sparks as an author one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels after a slow start with true believer '' i was more satisfied with the rescue '' taylor 's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl
i have read several of nicholas sparks ' books but this one was different for me it was a very very slow start i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot i had even considered quitting reading it at times it ended up being an okay story but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading what i did enjoy is the way sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were i would suggest another read from sparks like the notebook '' or the wedding '' if you want a good romantic read
i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor 's was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find nothing oh what a waste it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it had n't been for my hrr home reading report i would n't have finished reading this at all i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah
i think cheryl jarvis needs to get a grip on reality ! what kind of wife wants to take a 3 month sabbatical from her husband and family to find herself people like her need to wake up and remember the commitment she made to her husband and children ! life can be hard sometimes and can take us all on a ride we do n't like or in the wrong direction women like these need to realize that they have made other commitments now and have to stick with them ! her children come to her and ask her not to leave does n't that right there give her the clue that maybe her dreams and goals have changed and being a mother is what she is now ! this is why you see divorces at like 60 now because no one wants work at a marriage anymore when it gets too hard they just pick up and leave ! i do n't like the message this book is giving and do n't recommend it to anyone ! you have problems with your life talk it out with your husband do n't read a book from a person who does n't know the first thing about marriage ! what ever happen to talking things out
in stephen silbiger 's words i realised that the basics of an mba education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience '' what the author is trying to do with his book is to cram in two years of an mba education into 350 pages naturally the book misses the whole point of the exercise of a university education it takes time to grasp the often complex models that students will have to master in order to be eligible for a diploma with their name on it it may be true that a lot of mba programmes are very repetitive and that the basic information can indeed be summarised into a few pages only however this means that all the details is missing as we all know mba programmes are very heterogeneous and will all differentiate at teaching something slightly different in as far as the subjects are concerned obviously the contents remains the same for the same subjects silbiger 's mba is based upon 9 subjects where others like negotiation international business entrepreneurship or project management are all summarised into one chapter what this book does well is to emphasise that the main objective of an mba is to be able to take a global decision within an organisation that is decide in such a way that no aspect of your entrerprise will be defavoured in any way however not only does the book lack in perspective the author literally bases his this book on his personal educational experience and does not focus at all beyond the us border but at the same time the contents of this book is very shallow the great theories are only outlined in very general terms and a lot of detail and further theories that you should expect from a sound mba are missing totally the book is an insult for all those who have actually completed an mba by spending one or two years at a constitutional mba and puts the reader at a very low level thus only the lowest rating can be awarded for this book as it fails to deliver what it promises
i understand that some terms are but in 1998 to use the term nigger in the woodpile '' in quotes or not does not ride well with me i have to read a handout from this book for a class had i bought the book i would 've returned it but since i can not return copies i guess i 'm stuck with it but i will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout
this was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author 's task management system this was the beginning of the scientific management '' line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book the essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time he also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success still a reader should n't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources the book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers
i bought this book then i recieved and invitation to rieview it but i can not do this review because the book never arrived to my home of course they took my money from my credit card i guess i will have to buy it somewhere else
i know a lot of people liked this book but it did n't work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is they did n't there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin early on but no one does not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation
the plot is ridiculous the characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger we are supposed to believe that hank is a normal good '' person who commits evil acts out of necessity but really there are many other more logical steps that could be taken he continually chooses the immoral path i totally hate this book and the only reason i gave it two stars is because i am still reading it obviously if i hate it but continue to read it there is something in it that wo n't let me put it down maybe that was smith 's objective all along
i have read every book by hillerman more than once and am a great fan i just finished this book and discussed it with a we both agreed it was so we can not believe it was written by the same person the writing was awkward and by the second page i suspected something was wrong here it reads like some cheap harlequin the sensitive handling of navajo spiritual beliefs the beautiful rendering of the landscape the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing all i can say is the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of tony hillerman 's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye he has given us much enjoyment he deserves better and if someone else is fleshing out hillerman 's plot the public should be warned
if tony hillerman wrote this novel novella actually i sure ca n't tell i have been a fan for many years but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman 's other work it is reminiscent of a 'b ' movie instead of building suspense the plot is laid out all too plainly the characters are unreal and the romance does n't ring true i am amazed that it was published
i can not believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book absolute power david what happened the story is very fascinating but the characters were not i found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person but our herione luann is not believable he has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand there were just too many up and downs for me i am sure the next book will be back on track
i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book
how to get the most money for your property this topic worthy of a book gets a couple of pages which are platitudes this is the second book of his i 've read recently in which he talks about determining the market price the approach he advocates will result in a variance with the market of 40 if not more and he lumps apartment buildings in with houses as if they were valued the same way of course they are not on the plus side in this book he recognizes that people do tend to get legal advice before signing a contract he tells you how to diffuse the lawyer 's criticism before it happens during my years as an apartment broker i dealt with more than a few lawyers including clients maybe his approach will work but i 'd think not this is another cheerleading book rich dad poor dad does a better job of cheerleading but has even less substance than this lightweight work once again the author has silly sales techniques that do n't work once again let me point you to the best writer in sales neil rackham spare yourself time money and effort pass on everything david finkel writes or promotes as i shall hereafter
i own have read their other books and regretfully have to say that their books are n't professionally edited their works seem to project an aw shucks '' tone but i find them to contain too much hyperbole i do n't bother with their new books anymore since the writing is tiresome and predictable they may have new information to share but that fact is lost because of the book 's poor editorial presentation
the pathetic thing about scams like this is that we 're all searching for ways to secure our future the thing is peter conti was a smart guy who did some real estate investing then he decided to become smarter and offer his secrets to success '' to everyone else for a fee ! how intelligent is that be realistic people there are no legal shortcuts to fortune other than hard work inheritance or winning the lottery there is money to be made in real estate and some gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not am i rich no but i 'm comfortable enough not to be willing to make someone else rich by buying products that only sell dreams due true research people go to and look under money they have great savings great investment go to do n't make people like this rich in the process honestly any of us can take his reword a few write our own book and sell some dreams its pathetic all these get rich schemes are designed to get the writer rich not you ! when you 're up late at night watching tv and see all these bogus infomercials turn the channel watch nick nite anything but the dream sellers '' invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of do true research do n't follow behind someone who 's only interested in how much money you 're willing to invest in your future '' aka are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv '' it 's designed to get you hyped up and how do i know well i 've never been to one myself but i asked my roommate to go to one on our '' behalf u know just to check it out and bring back some great information ! well yeah right '' is an understatement no great info just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the upcoming events '' and myself what i 've done is ordered information about an business that supposedly required no selling '' how unrealistic right well the whole thing was you create a website and let the website sell the product for you but how likely is that i mean of course you got ta put some effort into it and ultimately you 're doing what selling so luckily i only wasted 50 but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff do n't but the hype people do n't buy it just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a home but if you really want it work hard for it put in the time the effort and the research there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient and again i say do not follow the dream sellers like carlton sheets russ whitney peter conti and all the unless you have a strong desire to help them get richer while you look on in awe
mostly motivation talks suggesting that there are many idiots out there who will sell their houses to someone who has no credential but could talk smart
in louisiana if one does not pay the rent the legal authorities will place an eviction notice within a short period of time on their front door that tells them to vacate in 3 days this sounds great until you go back to the authorities on the fourth day and find out that legally they can not physically put the people out by law for 6 months i had a duplex and had no rent for 6 months out of one unit the payment for me way back then was only 125 per month can you imagine having three or four units today in this situation in louisiana unless the law has changed since 1970 but do n't count on it they still go by laws written by napoleon hundreds of years ago ha ! ha ! this book will guide you to their 2400 siminars and an 18 month course i bet if most of you fall for this you will hate peter and david in about 2 years or less yes a few people going for this will make plenty of money however these same ones would make a fortune selling junk used cars can you i do n't even want to think of having to make the payments on three houses in louisiana for 6 months of 1000 each until i can rent them out to other tenants who may tear the place up and not pay rent for 6 months i believe you can do much of this with no downpayment but you 'd better have money for unforseen occurences they will happen i got this book for free at the library
this book reads like a period piece with about as much connection with current reality as a victorian book of manners except of course it is rude and abraisive even in its heyday the manifesto was a measure of wheat in a mountain of chaff now that the internet is largely a tool to make customer service and contact even more difficult that before ever try to use the knowledge base '' of most companies it look even quainter all i could think of was webvan and the mass of uneconomic ventures that these and like fantasies spawned do n't bother read david ogilvy instead
i think the target audience is somebody who completely missed out on the late nineties but who would like a very light read to understand the change in openness and freedom in conversations that most folks now take for granted there 's not a lot of content here you can skim about 10 of the book and get seemingly 99 of the content if you 're really clueless '' hit the web version instead and save the effort of grabbing this book
pest control was my first book by fitzhugh and 30 pages into it i decided it will probably be my last the plot outline ordinary joe too fixated on his entomological obsession to notice he 's been accidentally mistaken for an international assassin is an ingeniously set stage ripe for grand comedy alas the curtain never rises above knee level the central events conversations which must create the grand illusion on which the story hinges are unimaginative unconvincing and alas not very funny the story goes from there into an adolescent action slapstick full of too many throwaway characters that mostly showcase the author 's lack of descriptive power if ever a story cried out for an editor this it it his awful similes their hearts were harder than trying to open an oyster with a wet bus ticket '' only look good compared to the juvenile imagination which chases the increasingly implausible plot into an oddly tedious crescendo of casual new york slaughter the final resolution tries to leap too many logical potholes to survive the crossing into epilogue intact the utter unreality of fitzhugh 's cartoonish world could have been a comedic asset if it were consistent but it does n't just migrate as the pages wear on it gallops away leaving this reader wondering by the end why he did n't quit on page 30
the book is there are certainly good points the characters are extremely underdeveloped however and seem to be mere characatures they could have been a lot better the book would definitely be better off as a film fitzhugh also has some serious issues with new york city unless there was a joke i missed he must hate it he spends of the book describing how awful dirty and it is all landlords are scummy all the subway riders are crazy or dirty or suits '' cabbies carry guns and will use them and so does everyone one else even if this were still true it detracts from the book
most everything included here is common sense there are a few important concepts included here but they are better covered in other texts
i did n't find much use for this book this author 's explanations on profiling '' will not help anyone who has basic common sense the profiling facts offered do n't translate into real help in beating the types of poker players we often confront i 'll paraphrase one profile who refuse to tip the dealer after winning a hand are cheap and people who do tip are typically compassionate and more likely to have a feel for what other people are doing do you want one more who dress smartly wear expensive clothes and play in poker games probably do n't care as much about the money involved than the thrill of playing the game if these common sense facts are new to you and you think they can help you play better then buy this book if not save your money
this is a pretty short book that i believe lacks substance i guess it is good to think about some of the items but the entire book could have been summarized in 3 or 4 pages i was hopeful at first when the author mentioned having researched fbi profiling techniques this in itself would be interesting to me but there seemed to be so much left out unless the fbi only has a small pamphlet on profiling some chapters seemed to be text cited from other sources with loose application at best i do not think there is much here except for 2 or 3 good points not worth the price if you ask me
i did n't buy this book but looking at the cover it does n't look so good
i find seth godin 's books incredibly lightweight there is really nothing of any substance here the usual series of marketing anecdotes normally about quite niche products i think the whole thing can be summed up in the old advertising cliche sell the sizzle not the steak he 's just given it a new word essentially he 's dressing up concepts in new clothes the book is poorly organised and repetitive and i think he succeeds simply because his books are so lightweight they 're easily digestible on a bus ride or plane trip do n't rely on any support for his theories so they 're not easily challenged and essentially say very little the marketing equivalent of the airport novel
finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty ! yunnus has proven by the success of his bank 's loans to the desperately poor that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support founder of the grameen bank he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world including the us and canada have shown that lending to the poor helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried yunnus ' book is inspiring and an it made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations can not bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help it 's hard to separate the book from the idea one is as fascinating as the other out of 5 points i give it a six
when will conservatives start trying to use facts reason and common sense instead we get vitrol once more sometimes disguised as reasonableness anyone who tries to paint with the same brush the liberal embrace temporary as it was of russia in the century and support for the un in our current day and time is once again using misdirection reading events in current history through the glasses of ideology actually sounds a bit like those who chose communist thought while ignoring how it plays out in the real world when the theory is filtered through flawed humans we get the transformation of our democracy into a place where patent ideological claims ride rough shod over the plain facts in front of us
i gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas the best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book i have read carolyn bill and amy 's books and i want to give this one a try this book is truly for the apprentice tv lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you
i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book 's hardcover edition all over town four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up the demure nape had always intruiged me what a mistake i found it redundant to the point where at certain spots after i had set the book down i was positive i had picked it up 10 15 40 pages earlier at a passage i 'd already read i soon realized indeed i was on the correct page it was just that a scene was again playing itself out on the page how many times does the reader have to experience rebecca 's regret nasty step and full daughters her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her it was the same disappointing over and over and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman 's sorry horrible life it felt as though she was a mute doormat i suppose it could be considered a real '' story but rebecca 's lot in life seems to be romanticised it 's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic it 's just sad
i listened to the unabridged version on tape i enjoy audio books because i 'm able to work at the same time i paint so i get to feed my desire for great fiction and get my work done at the same time blair brown did an incredible job as a narrator she was able to create a unique voice '' for each character in the story making it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go however by the time i got to the end of the tape i was glad that i at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel ! i was so disappointed at the end and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story from the beginning of the story i was irritated by the character 's daughters too also i was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in rebecca 's life ok she had an arc but it was all in her head i found it very unfullfilling if i had n't been passively listening to the story while doing something else i probably would n't have finished the novel
my friend told me this book is incredible but i found it a little far fetched personally why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up warning spoiler alert in the end of the book it would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters me i think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far two stars for your book ernest ! one star for each caracter you put in the story even including fish ! youre rating is as good as melvile got for his fish book so chin up
i was forced to read this in grade but could hardly bear reading it initially i 'd had high hopes for it because we 'd read such intelligent intriguing novels earlier in the year including lord of the flies '' and catcher in the rye '' but what a bore it was ! old santiago goes out to fish hoping to catch the big one '' drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best biggest '' that must mean i 'm macho a real man ! blah blah blah ca n't catch anything blah blah blah and when he finally catches the big one it is eaten by sharks the stupidest book ever i 've never been a hemingway fan and this book steered me further away from his work a pathetic book by a pathetic man
albert hourani 's a history of the arab peoples is a widely regarded general history of the arab world this is too bad since as history the book is of low quality with significant problems of organization and where relevant to hourani 's apparent biases factual accuracy it does have its redeeming elements but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the arab world especially for the beginner being the author of a general history of the arab world myself before i explain why i evaluate the book negatively i would like to suggest some alternatives lest i be accused of attacking a rival publication out of philip hitti 's the history of the arabs is a very detailed history which runs from times to the century arthur goldschmidt 's concise history of the middle east covers turkey iran and israel as well as the arab world and is for beginners it was the first general history of the middle east i read as an undergraduate bernard lewis ' the middle east focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region this book was first published in 1991. this review is based on the 1992 paperback version by warner books the initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter although containing 458 pages of main text hourani 's history devotes a mere seven pages to the period this is pretty amazing for anyone familiar with that period since arab history prior to islam is roughly as long as arab history after it exactly how far back arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute but certainly there were people one could call arabians '' as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium bc or years prior to muhammad the evidence is sporadic for sure and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times but seven pages is pretty paltry one might suspect an islamic bias here but the problem continues in the key early periods of islam the life of muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the muslim world spanning about a half century from muhammad 's first vision to the death of his and successor ali get only 11 pages the first arab empire the umayyads gets seven pages and the abbasid empire 945 which is usually thought of as the golden age of islam '' gets only six this means 37 pages for the first years of arab history including its framing epoch and over 400 pages for the next this would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion what makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization the middle time period between the collapse of abbasid authority roughly ad 950 and the ascendance of the ottoman empire over the arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history this is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of sunni and shia arab persian and turkic ruling groups not to mention the latin states hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one there are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods the umayyads and the abbasids there is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time if you want to understand the relative historical roles of the buyids the fatimids the zengids the ayyubids the mamluks and their contemporaries read something else it is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength its social history '' or its description of the development of the arab world in fact i cited hourani on the social history sections of my own book in this regard hourani really is better than the alternatives over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the arab world came to be prior to the ottomans so for those who have already read a general history of the middle east or the arab world and want a more specialized knowledge these chapters are quite useful i have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest this book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of arabs and muslims to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the arab world which might be interpreted negatively the word jihad '' does n't even have an entry in the index although it is used or perhaps misused on page 247 hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom 's defense '' this gives a misimpression because legally jihad has two military meanings the defense of muslim lands and the muslim community 's collective obligation to spread islam through conquest although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application its use is overwhelmingly in the military context and while muhammad 's battles probably could be described as defensive the vast majority of military actions between that time and the century involved offensive operations the christian known as the crusades being a major exception more broadly the single most influential islamist movement of the modern age the wahhabis get only a few scattered mentions and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time the primary ideological influence marxism is discussed of course but the influence of nazism during the and is left out nazi germany is mentioned once in passing and in the same paragraph on page 331 palestinian leader amin husseini is mentioned but it is n't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of nazis that he moved to germany during the second world war and played an active role in the holocaust or that despite this he was made leader of the palestinian cause by the nascent arab league after the war hourani 's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate giving the impression that egypt engaged in some bluster and then israel started the war he mentions nasser 's demand that the un clear out of the suez canal zone and includes the defense pact with jordan but omits a key fact the mobilization of egyptian forces in the sinai once egypt did this israel had no choice but to attack because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization while egypt could hourani also does n't mention the statements by arab leaders to the effect that all jews would be wiped out in the coming war on the whole this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern otherwise i do not recommend buying it
to give context to my comments i have a degree in middle east history and bought this book first edition in 1992. i began it several times over the years only to be defeated by the dry prose and ceaseless repetition of unrelated facts i finally sat down to read it from start to finish a few months ago now that i 've finally finished i realize that i wish i had never made the attempt it is boring but worse than that it is deceptive all references come for the first edition hardback 1. 191 regarding domed buildings the transition from the square hall to the round dome posed a problem which was solved by the use of the squinch or pendentive often with stalacites for decoration '' this quote gives the false impression the arabs solved the problem of placing a dome on a square hall google haggia sophia '' and you will see a dome sitting on a square hall built by eastern roman christians in the 2. constantly discusses communist arabs in a neutral to positive light 325 but fails to mention the presence of fascist influences in arab politics especially the roots of fascism in the ba'ath party as a result of arabism 's fascination with european power politics 3. 359 regarding the move by the surrounding arab communities to crush the newly created israel arab forces moved into the mainly arab parts of the country '' hourani then claims fighting broke out because the absence of borders allowed jews to occupy the greater part of the country '' this is a deliberate falsification on hourani 's part the arab forces publicly stated aims was the destruction of israel and the removal of the jewish community from palestine 4. 368 regarding the resolution of the 1956 suez canal conflict under american and soviet pressure the three forces withdrew '' here hourani implies falsely that france britain and israel were affected equally by and soviet threats in fact the sixth fleet shielded the three combatant forces from the irrelevant soviet forces while acting to pressure the combatants to withdraw even more eisenhower 's use of economic retaliation against the weak french and british economies did most of the work 5. 413 in one of the most egregious passages blames israel for a war of aggression against the peaceful egypt jordan and syria in the six days war i recommend the book aptly titled six days of war june 1967 and the making of the modern middle east to dispel any misunderstandings fostered by hourani 6. even when writing honestly hourani tends towards dry and needless repetition by way of example are his nearly indistinguishable passages on arab poetry on pages 87 153 187 239 305 340 which could be summarized as poetry both oral and written is the greatest achievement of arab culture even today it retains many of the same themes and similar structures to that created in times '' except hourani takes 18 pages over the course of the book to say it in conclusion i can not recommend this book for either the beginner or specialist the beginner will be overwhelmed by the flood of unexplained names dates facts and figures the specialist will constantly find problems with hourani 's accuracy and honesty there are too many good books on both arab and islamic history for you to waste your time on this one
i really was interested in the topic of arab history but found the writing so boring i had a hard time staying awake i finally gave up i would look for another book on this subject
this is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself this book did n't really make me feel anything i never got so that i cared about the characters i never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either this is one of the books that you know you read but you just ca n't really remember later on i would n't recommend this
i gave this book a low rating not because it 's offensive '' but because it 's blah humor i am a huge fan of offensive parodies ex south park and family guy but i found this book disappointingly boring the jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated pollock jokes but most folks would find it to be a major or just annoying if i get a funny book i want to laugh through most of it not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages too much work anyhue if you want to laugh at pregnancy better books are be prepared a practical handbook for new dads '' my boys can swim '' for the gents and pregnancy sucks '' for the ladies they are waaaay more funny and somewhat educational too whoa ! what a concept
i got this as a present for my fiance thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our it got here and neither of us were 's a horrible book
this book was purchased for me as a gift from my wife i did not find this book to be even slightly amusing the subjects that are covered in this book that are supposed to be humorous were in fact insulting to my intelligence i believe that it is a serious problem if males make fun of their when pregnant instead of using real humor this book uses stereotypes and the notion that all males hate their significant others this book relies on the typical misogyny that males in our society find amusing we should be encouraging and supporting our significant others rather than mocking them from a medical prospective i do not think males should mock or discourage healthy weight gain in pregnant females also i no not agree with mocking making fun of or parodying other healthy symptoms of pregantcy
i got this book for my husband hoping he would have something interesting fun and helpful to read while i read 'the girlfriend 's guide ' and it turned out to be awful the book is written for a very immature man and was dumber than it was funny we threw it away after attempting twice to read it
i 've been a fan of heinlein 's sf for just about as long as i 've been an sf fan at all somewhere around years but when i read this collection some years ago it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether the fiction is pretty good although even that is n't heinlein 's best but to describe the nonfiction accurately i 'd have to use words that amazon will remove from the review anyway for the most part the pieces collected here represent a side of heinlein i strongly dislike though i respect it 's never going to be my favorite heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of fascism '' and i 'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection and mind you it 's not because i disagree with heinlein 's opinions it 's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic at least in his fiction he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically in short to grok them not here boy heinlein who bought into the semantics fad pretty early on spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions but his own attempt at philosophy as represented here in the pragmatics of patriotism '' is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy i 've ever seen then too people who knew heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him well he 's certainly unpleasant here anybody who does n't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a even in the unlikely event that i thought he were i would n't find this a very helpful approach perhaps more surprisingly his popular writings on are n't very good asimov 's reputation as the great explainer '' is in no danger here this volume is second only to from the in cementing heinlein 's posthumous reputation as a rather fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was when i want heinleinian company i 'll stick to davis manuel garcia o'kelly davis and maybe lazarus long and when i want to read some humane nonfiction by an sf master i 'll still turn to asimov i credit heinlein with three magisterial novels several ones and a good number of brilliant short stories but the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer
if you read this book looking for ways that your product company or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with tipping point gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it was n't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated he builds up a theory of things needing to be sticky which is fine but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory anyway the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he 's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read
i 've watched mark bittman on pbs and really liked his style i have some cooking skills but would like to be better and thought this book would be a good start i was wrong i tried a couple of recipes and they all failed the eggplant saute and the boiled shrimp were waaay off in their instructions and were inedible this is not a good book i would recommend cooks illustrated magazine and at blanchard 's table these have been great resources for me to help me improve my cooking skills and understand why certain things are done certain ways plus there 's always the alton brown show good eats on the foodnetwork
what a terrible disappointment this book was it 's all in the how to cook everything cookbook that came out a couple of years ago you are best to get the larger book and pass this one up mine is coming back to amazon
this book is a great stepping stone for understanding but considering the occam 's razor theory the simplest explanation is the best '' i feel simply that understanding maslow 's heirarchy of needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs or anyones for that matter being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others by clearly understanding the role we are in knowing what actions to be successful to do and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children then we will automatically cover any areas of possible temperement hinderings '' in others to achieve the above i reccommend the bible the book by hal urban available here at titled lifes greatest lessons 20 things that matter to know the 8 things that sucessful people do and refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called a family '' confucius stated the strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home '' i say duh ! !
loved his other books but this was all over the place hard to read and to apply
i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book his other books were so good i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be in applying some of the recommended techniques my 11 year old daughter emily thought i lost my mind thank goodness things are back to normal we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice
i wonder how christians would like a book called anthropology for muslim witness '' or anthropology for hindu witness '' that is how all anthropologists will feel about this book anthropology is not for anybody 's witness '' it is to witness the diversity of culture and religion itself anthropology is not designed or intended to impose one culture or religion on another in fact that is the very opposite and antithesis of anthropology anthropology is a science and a method for understanding and valuing other cultures on their own terms not witnessing '' your own culture to them and that is what one 's own culture or religion is just one more culture or religion in the pageant of human cultural and religious diversity this book is a travesty as are all such attempts to bastardize anthropology in the service of the most causes
considering the hype i really expected more the interview is only half the book and the type is huge despite being a trade paperback there are only about 80 as many words per page as with your average mass market paperback the interview was unedited so a portion of it consists of heinlein saying what was that how do you spell that '' and then schulman spelling it out the interview itself is about what you would expect from a with a political axe to grind the rest of the book is filler letters that schulman wrote heinlein schulman 's reviews of some of heinlein 's books all of the above are spiced with the expected libertarian rantings and hyperbole schulman 's claim that anyone who thinks heinlein was a fascist is a marxist heinlein was not a fascist but at best such rejoinders show the same lack of intellectual depth and integrity displayed by some of heinlein 's critics in short this is a short expensive book that is more about schulman than it is about heinlein
frabato bardon battles the evil lodge on the eve of wwii this book is written in a flash gordon the cosmic meanies '' style further fractured through the services of a bad translator if this is bardon in action then imagine a scratchy sound track really evil bad guys in black suits and top hats and the ultimate good guys being koot hoomie and his ascended masters gliding to the rescue on flying carpets bardon 's secretary wrote this one and i really believe she was planning to farm this script out to fritz lang at most quaint at worst a disappointment to anyone seeking enlightenment on the hermetic front
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and does n't let go mercy stands out from all the rest you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
if a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you does that mean it 's a good book or a bad book in the case of mercy i 'll have to go with the latter i found i could not get past my intense dislike of both cam and mia truly two of the most despicable selfish characters i 've ever read in any book i 've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities their sole intent were their own wants and needs regardless of who cam 's wife allie got hurt allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over i never got that impression she was the owner of her own business and she was determined to help cam 's cousin jamie she also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband it was her love and loyalty that cam felt totally comfortable in betraying at one point late in the book allie asks cam if he and mia had laughed at her he tells her no however in a way they did considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed i felt for allie she deserved far better then cam i really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of picoult 's books i understand her latest book the tenth circle is no different she is without a doubt an excellent writer but this one just was n't for me
this was the book i 've read by jodi picoult and the one i liked the least i was intrigued by the subject of the book as i have been with all of the subjects she has written about but this story did not measure up to my expectations at all this book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing and could you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time one of the main characters is cam macdonald who is the sheriff of wheelock mass cam 's cousin jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to cam citing that he has just murdered his wife later you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked jamie to kill her so naturally jamie has to go on trial well a majority of the book turns out to be about cam 's adultery which is annoying in and of itself it seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok ' since as you discover cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it 's expected of him plus the person he has the affair with he has known a day or so which is ridiculous interspersed throughout all of this almost seeming like an afterthought is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover i was very bored with this book but continued to read it thinking it was bound to pick up eventually it never did as it turned out i ended up skimming the last 80 pages if i were you i 'd pick another novel
really tried to like this book premise was grand story bobbed and weaved conclusion was flimsy discursive scientific literalizations distract disorient crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
it seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best just include the words power prestige wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life power talk fails to live up to its title it is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about but it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two this book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably wo n't help much the key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary structure etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title
i really do n't think that changing my voice mail will help me succeed in my corporation the author talks about mixing two forms of language edge and center to have a perfect communication with the people you work with employees employers boss etc and never tells you how to mix these concepts and besides if a certain form of language works for me center or edge i really do n't see the point on changing the way i never close a book forever before finishing it but after reading a couple of pages after the middle of the book and realized that i could be reading something else so i decided to stop with the torture
the book is really boring its like an interminable speec
this is perhaps the most expensive book besides collectables judging from the size and amount of information it probably worths 5 but i had to buy it simply because the professor uses it as textbook granted that this is a book for business management professionals or 's but this does not mean the book should be this expensive you 'll know what i mean when you see the book i think they they are taking advantage of that fact that most people buy this book get reimbursed my self for one will get reimbursement from my company but i resent the fact that i have to buy such an expensive book and waste my company 's money only because i have to this is robbery it 's not printing book it 's more like printing money
i was able to finish this book unlike gilead but this author is soooo boring ! will not read another by her no matter what the reviews
this novel is comprised of pretty well constructed sentences that 's about all it is pretty well constructed sentences the story itself could be interesting after all it is a tale of abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested let alone awake the narrator although the main character was so far removed emotionally from her own telling of the story that you wondered why she had bothered at time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told
so many people have written glowing things about this book but i do n't know why i think that i am becoming too practical and logical as i mature so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness i think that the writing was but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel i did n't see why i should ever want to read it again or have read it at all it is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers so they looked all pretty and still alive but still the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer about the only thing i got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence i assume that i am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer but still thought it was rather a waste of my time
i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter '' your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like '' is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i 'm not going to finish this book because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other '' type of woman thanks
you have to read about 180 pages of this book before any action starts i was frankly bored by the entire book once the action starts it 's fairly contrived reacher is one of those very lucky or very unlucky heros '' and if you 're one of those readers who like to try to figure out who is doing the dirty deeds you ca n't there are absolutely no clues you can use to determine the perpetrators and who says the secret service does n't act proactively while this is one of the book 's major premises the history of the service is filled with proactive activities to protect those who come under their care i remember once when the president came to my hometown and spoke on the statehouse steps office workers in nearby buildings used telescopes to get a better view all of them were seen by secret service agents and men with guns visited them in one big hurry radios were used in abundance and this was over thirty years ago do you think the service has become more capable or less capable since then if a single radio was used in this story the perpetrators would have been caught about halfway through the book when president bush the first one wanted to walk across the mackinac bridge for the annual walk they took over the entire hotel where he would be staying and not because they needed the space a list of others who would be in attendance during the walk and at the dinner the previous evening had to be vetted starting 6 weeks prior to his visit including local police they even kept the pitcher of ice tea that he would be drinking from in a locked box watched over by an agent same with condiments after spending a bazillion dollars up to and after the president 's meal the prez graciously paid for his own meal and left a nice tip big of him so agents do n't just show up a couple of hours or in one case in the book a few minutes before the big event and throw a cordon around him i was also left with some unexplained questions at the end so it 's dull inaccurate and an insult to those brave souls who protect our nation 's leaders
clearly not the best from this author the story starts well but does not fulfill its promises i had a hard time reading it through the end
1. the persective of most writers is shaped by their own experience is an american black a baby boomer a member of the academic elite a liberal arts major and a political conservative '' certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues 2. i felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated america and during the civil rights movement his take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of civil rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain moral authority '' by doing good the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts helps explain some of the dysfunctional effects that are still with us 3. where i disagree with his analysis speaking from my own experience and perspective of course is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the us and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years ! and he blames the dissociating liberals '' whoever they are for attempting to deal with these social issues excuse me but i recall nixon and the reaganites being in power for awhile and the bush dynasty is still with us and i have n't seen a lot of effort being done to and fix things for average folks here in the good ole us of of course pressing the guilt button in this mainly culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention 4. my point is that by injecting blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even statement about red and blue states was a hoot ! how is this helpful where are his suggestions for improvement other than that he thinks bush now have the moral authority '' that has been so lacking in america some might be inclined to disagree 5. finally as a black steele misreads me as a white liberal in that i have never felt guilty about my white heritage only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans themselves victims of misbegotten religious we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative
buyer beware ! this book titled stealing love confessions of a dognapper '' does n't begin to even mention the author 's dognapping until page 237 in a book that is 267 pages long and those events are just a minor part of what the book is really about the author 's unfortunate and unhappy childhood i purchased this book in an airport bookstore and then struggled through it on a flight wondering when the dognapping was going to start thank goodness amazon has reduced the selling price significantly this book is not worth the 23.00 list price
it 's too bad that clive cussler changed collaborators on his oregon files '' series this was terrible ! i could n't even finish it i read a lot in all different genres so i feel that i 'm a little qualified to comment on a book i have read it dragged some of the characters were changed and even though i know you have suspend disbelief i could n't keep my eyes open golden buddha and sacred stone were much better
as i read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by cussler the story was slow and the plot was transparent this book just did n't have the zing '' of the older cussler stories if you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read
i have met paul hornung in person twice the second time was in green bay when i bought this book at a book signing not only did hornung charge full price for the book he charged an additional 15 for his signature ! i was the only person in line at the time and as a common courtesy i stuck out my hand to shake his after getting my book at first it looked like he would n't even shake my hand he finally relented and gave me a dead fish handshake without removing the sharpie from his hand reading this book was about as satisfying as that handshake hornung is big on name dropping but seems to have little use for the common fan this book reads easily but is not rewarding it contains many unflattering items about hornung he got his girlfriend pregnant in college and let her go off and have an abortion hornung told her whatever she did to keep it quiet to avoid any bad publicity certainly everyone has heard about the womanizing and hornung readily admits that much of it occurred while he was married to his first wife he also admits to smoking marijuana on multiple occasions and trying cocaine once he did n't like it gambling is justified as a way of life learned from his louisville upbringing an episode in which hornung used insider information on a player 's injury to place a large college bowl game bet is detailed his embarassing comments regarding lowering notre dame 's admission standards to get the black athlete '' are also discussed hornung seems truly amazed that just apologizing like a good catholic going to confession which hornung does n't believe in has n't enabled him to continue broadcasting notre dame football games i was astounded by the great number of factual errors in this book it made me wonder if the publisher has any fact checkers on staff off the top of my head i remember these errors forrest gregg was said to retire before the 1967 season to become an assistant coach at tennessee in reality gregg played for the packers through the 1970 season fred williamson was said to be on the oakland raiders team that played in super bowl ii instead of the kansas city chiefs team that played in super bowl hornung incorrectly states that the score of super bowl i was instead of frank gifford is said to be on the original monday night football team instead of keith jackson hornung states that he did n't like dan devine because he crippled the packers franchise by wasting several number one draft picks on dan fouts it that were true it might have been a good trade actually devine sent five high draft picks to san diego for john hadl not dan fouts eddie lee ivery 's last name is incorrectly spelled ivory i think paul hornung still sees himself as a matinee idol he has basically lived life on scholarship and i guess he figured he could cash in on this book without a great deal of effort it is obvious that more effort should have gone into this book for my money hornung is overrated it never ceases to amaze me how he is given more credit for the packers success of the 1960 's than leading rushing jim taylor
reading this book one might conclude that only five things mattered to paul hornung football alcohol women perhaps sex with women is more accurate gambling and nightclubs and the entertainers and hoods who inhabited them as a window into the personality of a rather shallow and human being this book might be worthwhile on any other level it is a failure it offers little insight into the game of football it 's evolution over the 50 's and 60 's or the people who played it for notre dame or the green bay packers instant reply or distant replay are both far superior what kind of school was notre dame i ca n't remember any class even being mentioned did hornung appreciate the unique environment of professional football in a small town like green bay wisconsin again not a word the book reads like a quickie done for pocket change some of the factual errors are quite remarkable hornung states that fred williamson played for the raiders and got hammered '' in super bowl ii wrong he played for the chiefs in super bowl he states that frank gifford was on the original broadcast team for monday night football wrong gifford joined in the second season replacing keith jackson one wonders if hornung actually read the ghostwriter 's script
somewhat interesting but hornung is a fossil from four decades ago let his career and life rest in peace he died several years ago

this small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover yet i find it unsatisfactory it meanders in and out of the history of islam and the middle east but loses focus on the way subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation but not really in depth it is obvious however that lewis knows quite a lot but still some clear mistakes or misformulations in chronology and factual events mar the picture and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled it has some really interesting insights in how the usa became the great enemy of the islamists and many details that makes the middle east history much more detailed than it usually appears yet in walking there and there it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of serge trifkovic for example and while trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the islamist threat lewis merely mentions the threat but then walks on to something else and he does n't really connect the issues of holy war and unholy terror in depth as promised in the subtitle bottom line while interesting i suggest to spend time and money on better books they are out there
since the end of the cold war writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war a war brought on by the clash of civilizations '' the theory as told by writers such as samuel huntington and bernard lewis amongst others suggests that the west '' is at war with islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier cold war acrimony not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us they suggest but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization it is the very essence of islam a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so aside from this rhetoric being advocated as fact '' by news organizations such as fox cable news cnn and most newspapers this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars the used it to justify the war with iraq and afghanistan serbs and croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of bosnian and kosovar muslims and it is used by israel to justify their war '' with palestinians the clash of civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war as opposed to the cold war with the soviet union a country only in existence for less than a century islam is an old religion spread throughout the world the framework of the cold war between the communist east '' and the capitalist west '' did prove useful in making this theory the new war is between the rational democratic secular and tolerant west '' and the irrational fundamentalist and violent east '' orwell could have predicted this well the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell it almost seems that for the west '' to feel at home with itself it needs to be at constant war with some other '' perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not we are simply not the other '' perhaps chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation 's own population are right not according to the clash theorists '' like bernard lewis who claim that the clash will continue as long as islam exists he believes that the radical islamic militants are not deviants from islam but actually have a more correct view of it they will therefore likely become more influential over the years but if such a clash really existed why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such islamic groups and nations as eqbal amad noted the has long supported this very enemy be it with iraq during and after the wars the saudi monarchy or the afghani mujahadeen perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its inhabitants to submit to their authority it was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these backward '' people in the long run to become just like the colonists beyond the arrogance of the idea colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations interestingly islamic militants use the same kind of absolute conflict '' to frame their war with the west they say the conflict is between the hedonistic degenerate repressive soulless west and the just truthful and moral center of islam speaking to this subject writers qureshi and sells note '' those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations speaking for the west or for islam exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism the assumption of a static essence knowable immediately of each civilization the ability to ignore history and tradition and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations ''
crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory the plot is laughable the writing is sloppy the dialogue is didactic this is trash not even good trash too bad to see the author of andromeda strain sink so low shame on him
i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references '' to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility '' but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet
may be as damaging as out and out lies i think crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth one of these that i found most disturbing was the antagonists statement that ddt was not proven to be harmful maybe so but the chemical reaction something that happens quite often in nature ddt has with some soils leads to dde which is very harmful to native species it reminds me of bowling for columbine whether you like micheal moore or not he had a thesis about how afraid americans are made to feel why do you lock your door at night if someone wants to get in they will moore touches on but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in american society crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups he portrays these organizations very well however the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world check the fbi website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago !
the title says erica jong on henry miller '' but it should read how henry miller impressed influenced erica jong '' this book is completely subjective filled with impressions jong has digested from reading miller 's works as well as from correspondence conversations with him it is mostly blind praise loaded with jong 's running commentary on american morals on such topics as sex lesbianism while of intrest to fans of jong miller reading this work to find out about henry miller 's life works will leave you still needing to find out about miller 's life works

this book makes the false assumption that corporations 'are here to remake the world ' the fundamental goal of corporations is profit growth if that needs a remake of the world they will do it otherwise not by the way this is also the aim of consultancy firms and one of the reasons why responsible officers are so suspicious of them seeing the huge fees involved these officers need them if they want to implement their own policies but need to present them as necessary measures proposed by outsiders the author has also no problem with an amoral market 'selling grain overseas for a better price while people in the village were hungry you gave up your loyalty to the village for loyalty to an impersonal exchange that would better everyone in the long run ' he forgets that in the short run people in the village could starve this book treats on the same level consumer activist ralph nader oil planner pierre wack nonrationalist and willis harman futurist herman kahn social psychologist kurt lewin 'kundabuffer ' ivan gurdjieff the developers of the 'managerial grid ' and or the authors of the report of the club of rome all this under the superficial dressing of some middle age philosophies some ideas developed in this book are important democratic leadership based on dialogue group dynamics the importance of listening and respect community and teams shareholder activism or jay forrester 's model about the interrelationship between population and economic growth environment technology and human aspirations it exposes also herman kahn 's optimistic future where everyone would be affluent and have the chance to be educated kahn also did n't foresee the domination of transnational corporations all in all i can not recommend this book amfortas has not been wounded by a spear in his groin but in his genitals
i bought this book based on the other reviewers comments and read through the whole book i usually have an open mind but this was a tough read for me of all of the fantasies in the book i only aligned with at most one of them or a few brief parts of 2 or 3. the author seems to be fixated on the relationship between sons and monthers with the father being the competition for the mother 's attention in the son 's view anyway that 's the author 's explanation for most of the chapters i 'm not going to debate the author 's point which on the surface would seem to imply that a household with only one son would be ideal '' but both the author and i agree that this would not be ideal '' anyway enough of that and on to the book the author has gathered up numerous letters from men that were submitted the submittal process was fairly random if readers saw a request at the end of her previous book for women or in brief blurbs in a couple of print advertisements so it seems that the people who would see these requests for input are a small subset of the population and of those only a small fraction would actually write a letter so if you take this book as a conpendum of fantasies from a fringe of society then you 'll start reading the book with the correct mindset i 'm a little unsure as to how to comment on this book but i felt compelled to do so because the other reviewers left out something that i would appreciate knowing so here 's a summary of the book 1. sons love their mothers and feel separated '' from them 2. fathers compete for mothers ' affections son goes to his room at night and father goes in with mother 3. the chapters are grouped sort of '' by subject area but there is no clear reason to the ordering of the chapters 4. there appears to be little editing of the letters composing the chapters the author even says that she was hesitant to edit the letters 5. the format of each chapter is usualy a couple of letters then some commentary then a couple more letters 6. the author attempts to portray the letters as a broad swath of society however from the letters it appears that many of the men writing over 18 have failed marriages or previous marriages and are on 2 or 3 in counting up the letters the divorce rate amongst the letter writers is significantly higher than the us national average currently at 40 per capita according to for those letter writers above 18. the author 's own statistics on this in the beginning of the book are misleading because she counts remarried the same as married this not divorced on the whole i did n't get much out of this book i was expecting something that would put some of my fantasies in context or give me cool ideas for some fantasies to fantasize about but in the end i had trouble relating to this book and chunked it
as a new mother this book disturbed me the author '' writes about her own experiences as if they are facts that all mothers are honestly experiencing and if they do n't admit it then they are just lying and she does n't trust them i have no problem with people writing about their personal experiences and i certainly do n't have to agree with their views in fact whether i agree with is irrelevant the problem i have is that she writes as if she is the authority over issues that she has only experienced she uses a lot of you will feel '' this will happen to you '' it 's ironic because she writes at length about how she hates it when people tell her what to do or how to feel and yet that 's what she does to her readers she also just about everything she writes about and does n't give factual information for example in her breastfeeding section she gives only 2 extreme scenarios if you choose to breastfeed and are eventually successful at it then you are a breastfeeding nazi or you 're a sane person who realizes formula is best mothers i know do n't fall into either extreme camp again it 's fine to share one 's personal experience but she attempts to give factual information and even brings in her own expert to back herself up for example she says that her pediatrician has not seen any differences between breastfed babies and formula fed babies in his practice ok either she 's lying or he lied to her all one has to do is read statements based on years of research from the world health organization or the american academy of pediatrics to see that this is simply not statistically sound you do n't need a college degree or even a high school diploma to understand this i know how excruciatingly painful and difficult breastfeeding is for many women including myself i know mothers for a variety of reasons who exclusively breastfeed exclusively use formula and breastfeed and supplement with formula i do not judge women for their decisions as she clearly does which again is ironic as she 's doing the same thing to her readers as she feels the lactation consultants doula la leche league volunteers and complete strangers have done to her in her chapter on little braniacs '' she writes if you 're dying for your child to speak chinese why not adopt a chinese kid the upside is in a few years they can do your taxes on the other hand they 'll cost you a bundle in car insurance '' not only is this not funny but it 's extremely ignorant she says a lot of things like this in her book which readers might interpret as real '' and so hilarious '' but why does one have to say quite frankly mean '' things at the expense of others and others ' choices this has nothing to do with being pc '' at all by the way i simply think it 's unfortunate when people need to make fun of other people to make themselves feel better i believe that new mothers need to support one another as she also says she believes strangely enough i also like it when new mothers are willing to admit that they are not perfect and it 's refreshing when we can laugh at ourselves though claims to do all of this she actually just judges other new mothers and their decisions as well as puts them into 1 extreme camp or another in virtually every page i felt like i was in high school again reading a book written from one of the mean '' girls but i 'll stop here i do n't want to stoop down to 's level
this is just one in a long line of yeah i have a baby but that 's not going to affect my life one bit '' books as others have mentioned her breastfeeding section is just sad if the author wants to use formula that 's fine no reason to bash moms who nurse ca n't recommend this book at all
this book was not funny at all i consider myself an open person if a mother wants to breastfeed then she should breastfeed if she prefers formula then use formula there can even be a happy medium i used both this book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish nosey busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice it implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims i found the material and language to be offensive and insulting
redundant reference to nearly every main point this book could easily have been one third the length and twice as effective if the author had been concise
i was ready to like this book i wanted to like this book i 'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel so i began reading with great anticipation only to discover deep disappointment i have n't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one the idea is an interesting one intertwine the story of marconi the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently the problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing character development there is none tension there is none we know the outcome before the book starts plot plodding pacing the author gives away the wireless during the first chapter so there is no mystery at all no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader these historic naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book and there is no dialogue at all ! we only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story the author lectures us on all that happens historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading the murderer hawley crippen is so shockingly inept that one wonders how the man was able to tie his own shoes he is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife 's disappearance like she ran off with another man for example he allows his girl friend to wear his wife 's easily identifiable jewelry and furs right in his own office ! does he imagine no one will notice he even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy 's clothing all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy when its not being a history book this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the times of london a nasty twit killed his wife and was caught yawn i gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting i would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist 's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read and you found it sitting there in summary a depressingly dull and boring book do n't waste your hard earned money on this one
this dictionary may be good for the layman but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer only the most common legal words are included so most of the words are familiar to lawyers those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included i would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms but not to a lawyer or law student
andrew weill is perhaps the most of these type of practioners unfortunately some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven for example in study after study large amnounts of vitamin c given orally do absolutely nothing more than a placebo for cancer patient yet he still preaches this given intravenously actually there is some evidence that it may work for some it does not work by stimulating your immune works in a different way the book how to treat and prevent cancer with natural medicine is far superios in my opinion even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002. even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking vitamin c orally over a placebo and the authors freely admitted it but much of what the discussed in that magic supplements to take when you have actually been proven i am a cancer patient with myeloma maitake d fraction curcumin it must be taken an hour before meals selenium and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on they do not promise that they have a cure of only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine they do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure the book by quiallan i think claims that an organic diet will cure you and there is post after post that this has actually worked maybe it as a myeloma immune system is overstimulated so i can not take most immune system some like vitamin c are actually antagonistic in vitro to myeloma usually translates to the same thing in the positive in studies that often do not pan out anyway i am not saying weill is all wrong but do not pretend he has a cure i have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice another two by healers i am not religious and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his ph totally got rid of his cancer i believe these people all may have gotten rid of their localized tumors this way for blood cancers such as leukemia and myeloma a cancer of blood produced in the marrow we do not exactly have localized tumors but with the addition of supplements mentioned in murray et al 's book my response to medications has been phenomenal and i have went into remission unfortunately at this time myeloma always comes back from remission there is new understanding why this may be just came out december 2005. there is even a drug it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while
i read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening i advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip the author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself i did this i did that i am this '' when he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy oh you have cancer ! dont go to a there evil get some ginsing and meditate im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine and should not be considered a complete replacement
it 's great that weil recommends that we get fresh air exercise eat lots of vegetables avoid fast food hamburgers breathe and think positive healing thoughts but that 's the extent of his good advice he also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out the whole soy story '' by kaayla daniel and the fluoride deception '' by chris bryson between soy and fluoride you 'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks or and that does n't bring optimum health
my daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago i know weil is an educated man but i 'm sorry i just can not take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health look at the size of this guy either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking or salmon and seaweed are very fattening i would say its probably the former i kept looking for after '' photos but alas there are none this is how he looks
it is necessary to note that this book is required for cadc licensure in some certification programs as such it is so poorly written and organized i am finding it difficult to get through it i am disappointed to have paid significant money for what is assumably quality research and information about substance use and abuse presented in a manner that is careless and disorganized there are innumerable grammatical errors and the author lacks focus and consistancy within paragraphs it is inexcusable to read a textbook '' where basic sentence structure and writing is neglected while the information contained is assumably valid and of great value its presentation is lacking at best i hope that future additions are more cost effective and adhere to a higher standard of professional educational writing
this is a surprisingly poorly written textbook one can tell that more and more information has simply been cut and pasted into this book over the years the continuity and organization of the book suffers the authors or a new author should consider writing a new text from scratch one that encompasses the entire field of substance abuse counseling more comprehensively
having read and enjoyed the author 's young adult book hoot and looking for a light adult read i picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light frankly it was both of thos things but within a hundred pages it became eminently easy to put down i enoy a diversion reading book periodically and have some adult writers that meet those needs thomas perry and harold adams to name two this one did n't make it for me it seemed to be a lot of given a hurricane one darn thing after another for a group of characters i did n't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together
so i love bill bryson and have bought many of his books and cds however i was dismayed to see something marked as audio cd '' shipped out which is a weird ipod nano sized device with the whole book on it appears to be a device not that that 's not a neat idea but it demands you listen via headphones i listen at work or while i drive and was expecting a cd i am returning this item and looking forward to getting a real cd buyer beware ! ! but bill bryson is a great reader and storyteller
book is out of date with modern economic thought essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets
is grant lee kidding did he print this off a desktop it is painfully obvious that the book was barely edited see the chapter on '' for details on 's prophet margin '' i wish i were kidding but i 'm not lee begins with a introduction describing his discovery of the truth behind bentonville 's new airport it 's all for ! he claims his knowledge comes from one informant smith a executive who seeks to ease his conscience by divulging the deep dark secrets of the government conspiracy project rollback lee insinuates that rollback smiley '' the mascot is named for this ostensible conspiracy and so is hiding out in the open '' i surrendered after the thrid chapter my brain no longer able to withstand the unrelenting assault on common sense and reason never mind fact a quick review of the remaining pages revealed an entire chapter devoted to a wide array of facts '' and lee 's personal political philosophy the rest of the book has little at all to do with save for a few anecdotes from lee 's time on the night shift o i beg you learn from my error and do n't waste a dime on this fantasy there is nothing the least bit credible to be found between its covers
well i guess it 's been a while since i 've been a college student i 'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now i guess all college texts have ridiculous prices this book used to be the best reference i 've ever seen on basic electronics for 's and even for it 's not much of a cookbook instead it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you 're designing or adapting the second ed is getting long in the tooth and since the book is used as a college text it 's preposterously overpriced the one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the otherwise excellent exercises and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you 're not sure about it will be interesting to see what the ed looks like maybe i 'll start a web site and publish the answers online
this book is way overated its wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well engineer it 's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic by some physicists '' so imagine my surprise when i read a translation of this in russian i think the whole world must have been duped do yourself a favor go read the smith book see my other reviews and avoid this one like the plague
do n't waste your time or money should have been a little more romance than cat and mouse and too many characters in this first book setting the stage for the next two books in the series it would have been super if it just focus on cass and rick cisco ! ! there were alot of depth in the main characters that left you hanging instead of bounceing around with other characters for her second and third book the book was a mess and poorly written i 've never given a author a 1 rating their are others who do n't agree that is why we can write our own review judge for yourself thank you
since you can tell how i feel about this book based on the title of my review i wo n't repeat everything that 's been said by the other reviewers so far however i will say that as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely i am so not happy that i spent close to 20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me i do n't want to throw it away but i certainly ca n't see where anybody would want to buy it if i it this book was a total waste of money if there were a rating i 'd give it that without hesitation
i wish i had seen these reviews for this book it is worthless in terms of information on obtaining funds for small business if your handicapped or a minority it might be of some use for loans nothing relevent for myself as an individual with no startup capital
i was very disappointed in this book because i felt like the title itself is very misleading the title of the book is called free money from the federal governement for small businesses and entrepreneurs '' by laurie blum the book description clearly states that there are hundreds of millions of dollars available free ! to small business and entrepreneurs when in fact the only thing that i found in this book pertaining to small businesses were loans and assistance programs and the last time i checked loans are not free this book description needs to be more clear as to what kinds of grants are available and the title free money '' should not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options from reading the book description i was under the impression that this was a book filled with nothing but grant information ! i was very disappointed and unsatisfied with this book if i 'm wrong or misunderstood this book please fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business grants are supposed to be located
i searched all over for this book it was even recommended through a business brief published by business reference services humanities and social sciences division library of congress in 1994. so you could only imagine my dissappointment when i realized this book simply lists a bunch of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on i got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled your guide to free government grants than i did from this over 350 page book i truly felt dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a grant
this was one of five books that i brought from and by far the worst of the lot this man has one idea about how the government really works take it from me i have been with the irs for five years
the first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story i could n't stand harriman if an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed he should agree with them and change it the story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters
i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the main '' characters of each section of the book are n't fully realized at all i would n't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored
richard pipes 's property and freedom offered by him as the work of a dilettante '' is professor emeritus of russian and soviet history at harvard he is the author of at least twelve other books including a concise history of the russian revolution 1995 and the unknown lenin 1996 his books are written in an agreeable prose a passport across any boundary but one in conscience property and freedom can not be recommended except perhaps to someone who is dying of incurable boredom and needs a dose of it to go over the side for rare is the person who can read this book without slumping over it and wise is the person who does not read it in front of an open fire as the great century historian jacob burckhardt wrote it is good for a specialist to be a dilettante in other fields but he should be one privately '' burckhardt weltgeschichtliche betrachtungen munich 1978 16 pipes instead chose to write a book pipes wrote poverty and freedom to prove that liberty and the right to property are connected '' an idea that emerged in the seventeenth century and that no one contests he claims however that though the idea is old the historical evidence for this uncontested idea has not been gathered and hence his book it is doubtful that after reading it the reader will learn what he did not know at the beginning and that is that rights have not evolved '' in a darwinian garden they are not sociobiological specimens and they are not the result of theological epiphanies they are powers that have been granted or seized because those who would deny them would suffer all else tracts scrolls philosophies testaments beliefs religious or pagan all of the scenery and scripts that we call history are as nothing compared with the central fact of power and its location magna carta for example benefitted english barons not englishmen at large and freedom of speech originated not in the mouth of an english divine or philosopher but in the grant of the english crown driven by the need of money to grant them to the house of commons for the history of the idea of property pipes recounts the thinking of western philosophers theologians and political theorists we are treated to the differing views of plato and aristotle the influence of stoicism on christianity the immense contribution of roman jurists the radical opinions of st thomas aquinas the inspiriting of capitalism by calvin the derisable ideas of the noble savage '' and utopia '' and on and on through the law of nature grotius hobbes harrington locke rousseau and the calling in of all people wordsworth and coleridge all of this and one has reached only page 49 with 328 a rumored oasis in the distance reachable after one has run barefoot over 907 footnotes in which one 's closing eyes may find six languages to feast upon if this book has one constant flaw it is its daunting incantation of facts and opinions that fly by like freight trains all to prove that the right to property is essential to liberty the flaw may be forgivable on the ground that pipes a polish jew who fled poland in 1940 at the age of ten has for decades lived intellectually with the murderous sweep of marxist communism fixed at under stalin and throughout the earth see stephane courtois et le livre noir du communisme paris laffont 1997 for property as an institution pipes examines history psychology anthropology and sociobiology to prove to us a people consecrated to materialism that acquisitiveness is universal among humans as well as animals he covers possessiveness in animals including insects from protozoa to primates careful to include dragonflies and the beloved stickleback at one point he writes such examples can be multiplied ad infinitum '' causing this reviewer to reflexively drop his book nor does the acquisitive behavior of children escape pipes 's cascade of what must be thousands of 4 by 6 index cards following children presumably in logical progression are possession among primitive peoples '' and societies of hunters and gatherers '' the myth of a primitive communism is bound and taken to the scaffold while private property in antiquity feudal and mediaeval times is reported together with the creation of the state as the guarantor of ownership pipe points to england as the classic illustration of how private wealth came to restrain public authority parliament the servant of the crown from the to the century then its partner from the to the early century became the crown 's master in the 1640 's the secret described by pipe in habitual detail was simple the crown needed money the people '' had it or controlled it and demanded freedoms and reforms for it he traces english history from times through the development of the common law the crucial history of english taxation the history of the tudors stuarts the commonwealth and the revolution of 1688. by way of comparison to england 's history the story of patrimonial russia including two and a half centuries of serfdom and seventy years of communist rule during the latter of which russians were deprived of liberties to a degree hitherto unknown on earth is painstakingly set forth in proof of how the absence of the right of property makes tyrannical government possible like its predecessors this chapter sorely needed surgery it is overloaded with historical material that satisfies only a narrow scholarly interest still there are matters that might engage the reader particularly pipes 's development of the idea that russians historically saw sovereign power as the source out of which property issued and the fact that russian liberals under the tsar saw law as the cornerstone of liberty but did not see the connection between law and private property in pipes 's last chapter he tours our welfare capitalist state complaining that entitlements create dependence environmental laws are oppressive minimum wage laws interfere with freedom of contract banks are pressured into minority loans rent control is bad economics administrative agencies are governmental islands broken away from the continental shelf taxation of personal income unjustly redistributes wealth affirmative action in employment is the most egregious form of governmental interference the government takes property by regulating its use and so on providing a communal table at which readers of this review at this moment are selecting their favorite complaints pipes 's book invites criticism but there is in this his last chapter a sudden disarming admission a way he writes must be found to preserve property as a fundamental human right while at the same time ensuring fundamental social justice '' had pipes but written a slim creative volume on social justice in a capitalist state he might have given us something worth fifty books on the connection between property and freedom the way to preserve the right to property and to assure social justice he argues is mainly by attitudes which determine how laws and institutions are employed '' this reviewer would put it another way on the one hand welfare capitalism offers the best opportunity for realizing freedom and achieving productivity while assuring minimum benefits to those least fortunate on the other hand working and middle class majorities may demand too much equality with the rich thus impairing the prospect of long term economic productivity and giving too little equality to the underprivileged to satisfy their right to human development thus the justice of welfare capitalism depends on the virtue of moderation by all classes for the sake of the common good imperfect as the analogy may be it is somewhat like one ship towing another at sea the knack is to keep both ships in step '' by using a tow line of such a length that the ships meet the waves and ride over them together otherwise one vessel might be in a trough while the other is on a crest causing the line to slacken and then tauten with sudden violence doing neither much good so too in welfare capitalism the expectations of the classes must be such that one does not destroy the other otherwise they will all go down
instead of being titled property and freedom '' it should be titled property and power '' pipes was a prominent old apologist for american capitalism and you can tell that he is still trapped in his little world of pipes overall argument is contrived and with the exception of his knowledge of russian history superficial most of his time is spent criticizing the stalinist soviet union while at the same time lacking any thoughtful rebuttal to marx 's critique of capitalism his title claim that freedom can not exist without private property is weak philosophically and logically he has poor insight into the nature of freedom and presonal responsibilty he would really benefit by reading some sartre or nietzche before trying to describe his own made up idea freedom his attempts to link economic thought with philosophy and history fail miserably he barely exposes the actual writings of marx this is incredibly unfortuante since most '' capitalists such as wealthy wall street brokers know that marx understood capitalism better than any of its supporters his philosophical support is all anecdotal with no real thoughtful analysis his historical summary although detailed with russia leaves much to be desired he fails to discuss slavery prostitution or even slumlords all which flourish under american capitalism although some might find his credentials enough to accept his flimsy argument i for one was greatly disappointed i realize that property is linked to power but freedom is something completely different i 'm sure many folks will look past all of this flaws in this books and embrace it i 'm sure the paternalistic allure of an established harvard professor will cause some to avoid challenging the views in his book but i 'm not trying to convince those people look past the credentials the excessive use of footnotes to appear more academic '' a clear sign of a writer who is insecure of his own beliefs ! and the comfort of someone who agrees with your agenda and you will discover shallow puerile nonsense
some passages in hollywood babylon ii '' strongly echo hollywood 's unsolved mysteries '' an obscure pulp paperback by john austin written in the girl 's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it '' hollywood 's unsolved mysteries '' page 82 black dahlia case the victim 's head had been bashed almost beyond that was n't the worst of it '' hollywood babylon ii page black dahlia case
it 's hard to know where to begin when talking about this sensationalistic book on the one hand not everything is a lie exaggeration urban legend or told in a gleefully sensationalistic manner and there are good pictures but those aspects are really overwhelmed by how much of the book just is n't true it 's uncertain just what propelled kenneth anger who has a very fitting surname to write this book was it the fact he was bitter that his own hollywood career never came to anything much a general dislike of most of the stars from hollywood 's golden age a love of sensational gossip in general or something else he 's a writer of the same caliber as an albert goldman or geoffrey giuliano and their own celebrity biographies it 's been shown that most of what they 've written just is n't true and has no basis in factual evidence and has never been proven so you have to doubt everything they write even if some passages are true or written in a respectful manner he 's like the boy who cried wolf although amazingly quite a few people believe all of the stories in this book and they 're now regularly discussed like they actually happened and are absolute fact even though they 're the results of speculation urban legends that have been disproven yet just wo n't go away because of books like this and are outright lies and character assassinations just because i 'm a fan of many of the celebrities from old hollywood does n't mean i 'm incapable of accepting that some of them did have less than perfect lives personal scandals and were the complete opposite of their screen personalities but by and large with certain exceptions the stars of that era were classy keeping their personal and private lives separate even if they did have say problems with alcohol sleeping around or drug abuse they still presented positive public images and role models of class grace and style it was n't like today when people seem to know just about every detail of a celebrity 's private life does anger somehow feel that celebrities of yore were more prone to scandal and devastating problems and why does anyone want to know some of these sleazy details like about someone dying on the toilet are we supposed to suddenly no longer like this person 's body of work even some celebrity biographies that do report events of this nature at least balance it out with just as much positive information and a respectful tone instead of taking delight in tearing down reputations it would seem baffling as to why people now take some of these stories as accepted facts no matter how many times they 've been disproven but again it seems to be human nature to believe the bad and not the good
i was excited to see that steven king had a new novel out i began the book full of anticipation eager to enter into king 's world however as i began to read i became more and more unable to sustain interest in lisey 's world i was bored and i gave up perhaps i will try again some time the book is still weighing down the shelf
this was my first experience with stephen king and i made it to page 150 before i quit it was agonizingly slow and it just was n't my cup of tea i told myself that i would quit at page 100 if it did n't seem to go somewhere but i gave it another 50 pages because it was stephen king it was brutal
as an american child growing up in france i had many testing experiences but none as grisly as those that befell the future novelist scott landon whose father was certifiably insane and tortured him and his older brother paul with a sharp cutting knife as stephen king tells it early trauma caused scott to retreat to an imaginary kingdom called boo'ya moon '' and then upon emerging to begin a career as an novelist and pultizer prize winner along the way he met and married a waitress with five or six sisters lisey debusher and they lived together for seventeen years until his tragic death two years before the action of the story begins as the widow lisey tries to get on with her life dealing with the problem of scott 's archive and if she finally feels up to disposing of it at a university library the remainder of the book is told from lisey 's pov and this will be what divides king 's public her stream of perceptions of every little thing of the past and present both in maine and in boo'ya moon and the way she feels the presence of her dead husband ever near most of the firestorm will be because of lisey 's pet catchphrases it is n't enough that she comes herself from a family ripe overripe with pet phrases all of them revolting but she married into another and then she and scott developed their own secret lover 's code and the reader can hardly keep it all straight you read on for a page or two thinking this ca n't possibly get any more precious and affected and then bang you have no smucking idea the book improves as it goes along although a subplot concerning lisey 's ribald older sister amanda and her penchant for cutting herself is nothing but improbable lifetime television for women nonsense a second subplot that focuses on a conspiracy between a scholar and a sociopath to wrest control of scott 's papers from his widow is even more unlikely and king 's latest supervillain the nutty jim dooley is very much like the john turturro character in the secret garden movie why does king even bother to give him a new name it 's the same character king 's fantasy of his crazed reader i suppose the sexual torture of women is very much dooley 's thing and something terrible happens halfway through this book that repels me even to think about after forty books i am now thinking stephen king your mind is a swamp and this writing excites you okay now this is one of those things that for me was a dealbreaker say you were the widow of one of the nation 's top novelists a working class woman who had come into a great deal of wealth say you 're now worth 20 million dollars as lisey is and say you had received telephone calls from a sexual psychopath saying he was coming to molest you and say he had put a dead cat in your mailbox would n't you seek protection could n't you afford say a bodyguard or would you do as lisey does and just call the sheriff and nod off when he tells you that sorry he ca n't help you of course it 's insane anybody would have called a private security firm and in fact gotten the hell out of dodge and holed up in ibiza until your 20 million dollars had tracked the sociopath down and had him disposed of by hook or by crook no commentators have mentioned this point so perhaps it has n't occurred to anyone else but it led me to think why indeed is lisey so wealthy i mean why is it necessary to the story would n't the story have worked just as well if she was an average everyday person struggling to make ends meet has king forgotten that there are people who are n't zillionaires in fact why is scott even a writer how was that necessary to the story could n't he just have been an accountant or something how many of king 's heroes have been tortured novelists it 's tedious to even try listing them every now and then king 's publishers make a big deal out of his literary skills and he drags in his quality '' writing friends to provide promising blurbs amy tan went to town to sell us bag of bones the end of the dark tower series was heralded as a major moment in contemporary writing now michael chabon tells us that lisey 's story represents some sort of gravitational shift in ecriture the truth is that all these books have been really terrible is it just chabon 's star fever that prevents him from seeing this i wo n't be fooled again
i checked this book out at my local library thinking there might actually be something useful to help me diversify my online income i was greatly disappointed not only does this book repeat what just about every other book on earning money online talks about but it also involves many things that could be considered spam and annoying practices the author states he is against those practices and insists that his techiniques are fine but i ca n't help but get a bit sick to my stomach when reading his tips also he claims its to make lots of quick money but even with his deceiptful tactics you will still need a good product which he does n't tell you how to develop in order to sell anything worthwhile please do yourself and the rest of the internet community a favor and do n't both with this book
this book teaches people the unethical way to advertise on the internet spamming following these methods at worse will put you in legal trouble at best you will be making money unethically and making lots of people angry these stupid get rich quick internet schemes do n't work anyways do n't waste your time or money
i want to concur with the other reviewer ever since i gave my email address to allen 's organization i have been inundated with spam for pharmaceuticals stock tips and genital enhancements the same areas he teaches his students to sell this is the first major spam i have ever received i think he is farming out my email to his other students as some kind of incentive to them be careful do not give your primary email to his organization ! the book has some decent facts but i would be careful about using email techniques that alienate your readers
robert allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did he will send you several junk emails a day unsubscribing does n't work and trying to block the sender 's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time the funny part is that the emails are n't even coded properly they always show up as just a bunch of html code would you really take internet advice from a guy who ca n't even code html properly anyway his spamming practices are completely illegal and it 's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him but that should n't come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before he 's had several with the irs lawsuits against him and a chapter 7 bankruptcy i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods many of those practices are illegal and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it for more info on allen visit johntreed dottcomm click on real estate investing then click real estate guru ratings bottom line do n't trust this guy and do n't buy his books and if you 're reading this allen take me off your mailing list ! !
anil is plastic if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country they are hidden as someone born raised in sri lanka i felt the situation could have been explained more for the rest of the world and suddenly this plastic anil who has shown no feelings no emotion not even surprise stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming you are killing us ! '' us and where does this emotion come from is even sure why sailor is dead was it accidental and meant for another was he killed by jvp for refusing to go on strike why was a killed by the death squads nothing was explained even the ending did sarath gamini just die was it a dream was it all just a sea bath in the indian ocean at mt lavinia
my husband who is off fighting for the constitution sent this book to our daughter if he had not sent it i would want a refund my daughter and i sat down to read the book together she thought the drawings did not match the words and thought the author still did not like the preamble he makes mention in the begining that he was forced to think about the constitution there was no inspiration from this book and she has n't picked it up again the pictures are not exciting to children and only vaguely connect to the words she loves the freedom rock version of the preamble and and really enjoys lynn chaney 's america a patriotic primer '' so i understand why he made the purchase however it is not inspiring or uplifting or interesting
flowery verbose rambling compound sentence upon compound sentence this book was unreadable for me i quit
ben franklin is my hero i have 12 biographies on him this was the worst i first started collecting franklin biographies forty years ago van doren fay issacson brands wood and a half a dozen others at first glance and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different a new take that concentrated on france well it was new and very different it put me to sleep in my chair several times i eventually gave up and shelved it with the others what a shame boring
i 'm giving up on this book it reads like a first draft sentences like the following on page 71 abound when you hear not so often as you wish remember our silence means our safety '' the committee of secret correspondence now doing business as the committee for foreign affairs although franklin who had never mastered the original name was not to know for months soothed the envoys whom they understood to be starved for news schiff needed a good editor but did n't get one this certainly is n't pulitzer grade material i wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the anniversary of franklin 's birth van doren in his biography gives a better account of franklin 's years in paris
i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me nothing ever happens there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story
this book was extremely short relying on large type and large margins to fill the book it was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste it was typical of oprah book club '' books in that it is very depressing i think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully you did get a sense of the main character but with such a short book the rest were very weak
i read this book and it confirmed my feelings that usa as the only super power should always remain strong the book is composed of some 400 pages full of critiques as if the author wanted america to be the haven of saints when the world has been full of crocodiles for instance the introduction brings about a fair resume of the author 's intentions how ! in the introduction i came across a passage which i hereby quote '' it was in the early days of the vietnam war that a vietcong officer said to his american prisoner ' you were our heroes after the war and a common phrase in those days was be as rich and as wise as an american '' what happened '' the title hope ' updated edition 2004 by william blum and many of the contents are indeed offensive to the usa because it speaks about military and 'interventions ' since world war ii and endeavours to portray them as the bad guys usa intervensions did n't such 'intervension ' save many countries that now live under the 'shades ' of democracies in europe and the far east japan enjoying unprecedented richness and prosperity with a high standard of living for their nationals as one individual out of six billion living on this planet do i blame the usa for protecting the interest of its citizens usa is the world giant and one has to learn how to convince them of one 's view points rather than garrulously defy them with boring speeches and empty written words
do n't waste your money on this tripe it 's completely biased with inaccurate information from an untrustworthy radical the premise is simple america the evil empire totally wrong for one thing an empire has to have colonies america has none evil it was these proxy wars that kept a nuclear war from happening to take blum seriously one has to believe as he does that the soviet union was never a threat and that they were n't behind the majority of third world revolutions in what universe more specifically this is a man who condemns american and british efforts to stop the bolsheviks without the soviet union there would have not been a need for any of these interventions iran blum 's us to secure cheap oil cooked up the communism angle and overturned a democracy into a dictatorship of great brutality wrong ! mossedegh was a communist who was not elected he was appointed then fired by the shah and when he refused to leave office the cia helped put the shah back on his rightful throne where he proceeded to modernize iran and most likely would have led it to democracy brutal only to those who actively tried to overthrow him most of whom were agents of russia even the ayatollah was a soviet stooge until he backstabbed them in guatemala evil us to protect a fruit corporation overthrows a moderate leader wrong ! arbenz was a communist the coup began in his country not the us when he began receiving weapons from the soviet union after he was deposed he took refuge in the soviet union too as for the dictatorship that followed it 's going to take a while to undo centuries of conditioning cuba evil us bullies a reformer into joining the soviets wrong ! castro hated the us before he was ever in power he and che guevara executed hundreds of men within the first few months taking what was a vibrant economy and ruining it even with 130 billion in soviet subsidies the bay of pigs was totally comprised of cubans all of whom were helping a revolt in cuba the escambray rebellion which castro stopped by having russian officers enforce a brutal relocation program to say nothing of the terror plots use of poison gases exectutions without trial and the fact that everyone on the island is trying to get here ! and very few of them are landowners castro according to rj rummel has killed more people than pinochet the death squads '' and somoza combined and multiplied any assassination attempt on him would truly be justifiable homicide vietnam hey i wo n't argue that our soldiers acted brutally but it was nothing compared to the vc 's deliberate reign of terror and genocide against the degar tribes the vc were not south vietnamese nationalists they were agents of north vietnam whose job was to weaken south vietnam for a northern invasion once the conquest was over the cong were forcibly disbanded and over two million people fled the country more people were killed in two years of communist peace than in thirteen years of american war true the northern invasion was not an act of international communism as we thought but we had no reason to think it was n't plus the north had signed the treaty separating north from south in good faith our heart was in the right place chile innocent socialist allende is overthrown by cia coup placing brutal pinochet in power wrong ! allende was not elected fairly he got less than 36 vote and was appointed by chile 's congress he had been a kgb operative since the and maintained his contact with them once they withdrew their protection his fate was sealed he ruined chile 's economy the chilean congress declared his presidency illegal and pinochet acting on cia reports that allende would have him killed did what he felt he had to do allende was not assassinated he committed suicide pinochet 's wrath was tempered by us connections targeting only those who actively sought his death while building a thriving economy the military saved chile '' said president eduardo frei montalva us pressure led pinochet to democratize and he did giving up power without a fight chile is today a democracy with enough wealth to go around iraq to revenge itself upon iran america arms saddam hussein to fight iran supplying him with horrible weapons wrong ! the ayatollah had one goal to overthrow saddam and create an islamic empire in order to defend himself saddam a soviet stooge decided to fight the iranians israel taking an opportunity to rid itself of two enemies convinces us that iraq is less of a threat us sells decidedly items of use including defenses against chemical weapons later turned into offensive weapons less than 1 of saddam 's weaponry was of american origin the iranians had far more leftovers from the shah 's day us supports kurdish rebels in north admittedly a mistake angola evil us seeks to place south african puppet in power to protect oil interests wrong !

mandela then if not now was to be blunt a communist terorist he was caught with enough bombs to blow up half of johannesburg and continued to maintain ties to the soviet union while in jail urging more terrorist actions while imprisoned nicaragua evil us its business empire threatened by a democratic revolution forms contra '' army wrong ! the sandinista revolution was clearly communist as their own documents reveal soviet documents confirm that the sandies were agents of the ussr as far back as 1959. the soviets planted sandy agents in mexico to plot us border raids confirming ronald reagan 's claims of soviet plotting in central america despite massive funding from us sandies get the soviet union 's best military hardware before any war made it necessary '' to do so revolution leaders kick out and engage in genocide against indian tribes on coast led by cuban officers indian peasants led by mostly former sandinista commanders begin contra '' war before any us aid us puts former somoza guardsmen in charge a mistake but even then they were mostly dissidents terrorists not according to oas who found little evidence of dirty fighting '' on contra behalf contras '' pledge to end fighting and return to farms once fair elections held side 1984 elections confirm sandy power us 's contra candidate crushed in landslide wrong !

the reviews were very concise and well focused on the criteria that a prospective owner should consider the book only covers breeds it would also be nice to have a chapter on choosing a mutt '' and what the criteria benefits and pitfalls might be color pictures would make it easier to recognize familiar dogs but ultimately it 's not vital to
for years i have been trying to find a book to replace the right dog for you by daniel tortora because his book now does not include an number of breeds i thought the perfect match might be the one what a disappointment i wanted to learn about the breeds and how they react and interact in their environments some breeds have more information but there are no cautions about puppy mills or the effect they have on the breed there is no consistent information about heriditary defects the this is not a buyers guide it does n't give you the information to make the educated decision a buyer of this book is hoping to make i wish tortora would write another book
f this industry crap poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack title gives them and remember this doctor '' is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives so why do you let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life
insane that anyone would ascribe to these ideas let alone actually trying to apply them i 've listened to the tapes read the books became more incensed as i went along yes there are differences between the sexes but this guy does n't come close to getting it right and if you 're a man following his advice then you can write off having a with an intelligent woman this fool creates escapes '' and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men claiming that it 's innate to the male gender and would suggest that their women forgive them for it ! sure forgive them expect them to grow up at some point ! i support equal respect for men from women and vice versa if i catch you flirting with other women and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book i 'll shove mister not doctor gray 's book where the sun do n't shine for those looking for a better appraisal than mine please google the rebuttal from uranus they really capture the truth
much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only it drags on and on sadly from reading some of the reviews on amazon hiassen 's stereotypical over the top books on the people of florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit florida after reading hiaasen 's books this is that people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like twilly spree clinton skink tyree and palmer stoat where does he get these names during my 25 years in florida the people i met had names like robert jim mary chris michael etc by the way for those of you who think i am just a floridian with sour i have been a proud resident of the northeast for over 20 years i just dislike stereotyping of groups of people it causes prejeudice misunderstanding and in extreme hatred read some christopher moore for your humor fix he does n't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way he makes them believable and fun
the two best essays in this book had been previously published perhaps in oprah 's magazine most of the rest were shallow not friendships and one even sounded like her of the month do n't bother
the only thing i liked about this book was the introduction i am a white professional upper middle class female 40 years old there was n't any story that i could relate to most of the women went to ivy league schools or at least seemed very upper class and snobby i ca n't imagine many people really relating if i could n't also a story about a woman who had sex with her best friends boyfriend and struggles with the idea that that friendship ended hmmmm what a surprise ! i ca n't think of anything more ridiculous and boring to read about get real that 's what i say about the whole book
i jedi is amazing amazingly boring ! you 've got a first person narrator which in the conceit of the sw novels is a really bad idea and this is n't even a deep star wars charecter he loves his wife he tries hard at school he never ever does something he knows is wrong the plot slouches along with on a quest to find his wife who does n't even really get kidnapped proper just sorta misplaced and sleepy he then farts around the jedi academy for a while despite not being in the jedi academy books because hey ! would n't it be easier to find her if i was a jedi this is the central conflict of the novel a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played super mario brothers eventually he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything so basicly you 're slugging through a miserable diary to get to an ok novella which then ends abruptly after all the excess chaff you put up with it does n't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages i honestly do n't remember if he saved the princess but i assume he did because if he did n't that would be awesome in the end it did n't really matter this was sooooo bad i ca n't believe how bad it was so bad ! baaaad !
the concise guide to economics a is small libertarian stroll through economics and finance it 's good in that themes are dealt with briefly leaving interested readers with additional references the tour through microeconomic issues is refreshingly honest clear and insightful the author 's objective is to explain why socialism is nonsense and why the equilibrium models of perfect information are dangerously simplistic cox does a splendid job here then we head off into macroeconomics and here the pace and pleasure drop off brevity becomes his weakness as complex big world topics are covered in a dozen or so short paragraphs not much of value is revealed other than the authors obvious belief that central banks are the problem and a return to the gold standard is a must the final third of the book is devoted to methodoly like the labour theory of value which forms the chassis of marxism again brevity sometimes works and sometimes does n't in all not a bad little book but if you really are looking for serious insights you 'll have to look elsewhere read the many quoted references three stars
lewis ' qualifications as scholar sound impressive but i was disappointed by this book although interesting some of the essays are indicative of senility the title says interpreting '' so i will allow him creative license expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in stalin 's treatise on the constitution
i generally enjoy reading biographies but this one was an exception ! a very boring read ! i did not think that lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did but i seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations i was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of lincoln 's life i feel that there was too much concentration on lincoln the politician his political development and not enough about his family and social life i wanted to know lincoln better on a personal level and i did not feel that this book provided much insight i may have been expecting too much but i prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep as this one frequently did
dont buy this book ! or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long wow i mean talk about boreing is it the best of times or is it the worst of times you cant make up you 're mind on page one sentence one even ! ! if i am this guys editer i would have told him to just write about the best of times thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow only one star for you but keep trying youll get there
mark twain once said that and i paraphrase the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read that is my experience with this book for some reason a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt so i picked it up what a slog ! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton a character who you barely get to know and root for lucie manette the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge an admittedly cool concept maybe this book speaks to another era maybe it 's past its prime maybe i do n't have the required literary sensibilities or maybe i could n't relate but a tale of two cities bored me to tears
the novel a tale of two cities by charles dickens is a story of love and compassion which takes place during the beginnings of the french revolution despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for dickens ' writing style throughout the novel dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes the language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on the character of lucie manette is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws her character is the supposed epitome for women but in truth is highly improbable throughout the novel dickens ' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue despite these countless imperfections dickens ' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution the book with all its shortcomings did reveal to the reader the atrocities that occurred during the french revolution and the events that led to it the abuse of the nobles and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel the one other aspect that dickens got right in his novel was the character of sydney carton sydney carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what carton feels carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life this characteristic is common among people and dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely the novel a tale of two cities is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often dickens ' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book 's dryness however dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy this is a book for a reader who likes dickens ' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories
i have all of nr books this is one of the few that i have not been able to read i have carried the hard cover book since it was first published from ma to california now to new hampshire when packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space i have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there i move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and blue smoke is going into storage that will leave room in the suitecase for her next book a jd robb i believe i was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as i did
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death i am a great fan of nora roberts and really looked forward to this book believe me it is not one of her best i started off admiring her setting and characterization of the hale family but then this went on way too long it also took way too long to get to the real story the middle of the book bogged down to the point that i had to make myself keep reading which is very unusual for nora roberts much of the plot was over the top unbelievable how many boyfriends of one person can be killed the 20 year mystic connection with bo does n't quite come off either i 'll certainly remain a great fan of roberts but no one 's perfect i guess
this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up
fall 2004 spring 2005 students the edition of this book is published and comes with a cd and in some cases a free world atlas check with your instructor for requirements in any case i would n't spend 100 for the edition have n't read the book yet so no rating
suffice it to say this text is awful an arduous task to understand and conceptualize i 'm taking a lower level geography course with this book as the primary text and find myself ready to punch a wall when attempting to read
life is too short to be spent reading drivel stuart woods was really off the mark with this book you should n't rest on your laurels woods your audience deserves better i 've enjoyed your past books very much but this one left a lot to be desired i was very put off by stone barrington 's activities in this story with arrington mother of his son one night then with holly the next i do n't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books the plot was relly silly and contrived it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story never mind quality do n't waste your money on this one
i usually enjoy his books even though they are formulaic but this one was so thin in plot it was sad it was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes even these were thin the dialogues were stilted there was no character building if per chance you had n't read his other books i agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book i do n't usually write reviews but felt compelled to comment on this boo
i bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane not one of my better decisions very wordy and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it 's totally absurd reminds me of the way the cops talked in dragnet '' we are talking zero development of characters perhaps woods feels he does n't need to give any depth to characters that he 's been writing about in previous books well he 's wrong you basically just do n't care about these people they are n't real and they talk weird not much action either unless you count actions like they got in the car they got in the boat they got in the plane you get the picture this is another case of a author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money do n't fall into his trap like i did there are a lot better books out there
as a huge fan of chiefs '' stuart woods first novel i decided to give dark harbor a try what i found was a predictable plot gratuitous sex and all the marks of a spit out thinly plotted books '' machine stone barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family 's life and left stone as the executor of his will when it is discovered that the cousin worked for the stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work as they investigate and the suspects materialize the plot grows more and more predictable run from this one
i think i 've read most of woods ' stone barrington novels enjoying them thoroughly but this is a sad addition to the collection he just called this one in unrealistic plot unresolved plotlines bad dialogue think he 's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher 's lament ' you just have to release another stone novel this year ! '' there 's no pride of authorship in this book it 's strictly a throwaway the circular bin is where it 's ended up
i just got back from vacation where i read a handful of fun crime dramas this one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph the writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start i 'm not sure who the target audience is for this book but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year there was a really strange mix of detail and inference it was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing and the sex scenes were just bad i really could n't recommend this book any less
reading dark harbor is like watching a mediocre tv show that you ca n't be bothered to turn off i listened to dark harbor as an audio book so i do n't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because i it ' while i was doing other things that had to be done anyway like driving if you are looking for something that feels fresh and new dark harbor is not for you this novel is about as innovative as an episode of murder she wrote to illustrate stone barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim 's wrong hand i think i actually saw that one on murder she wrote woods either ca n't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply does n't care it is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in dark harbor this is n't because the clues come together in any logical way but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel you can just tell this does n't mean that the solution makes sense in fact there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced it is as if woods could n't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do except of course to have sex with stone holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island on her second trip she has an obligatory romp with stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel why was she kidnapped i do n't think anyone including woods can answer that question in any plausible way my theory is that woods needed to work holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages it also allowed him to include holly 's dad another regular character in her search wood 's motive seems obvious the kidnapper 's motive however is n't her kidnapping makes no sense but clearly this was something woods did n't think was worth worrying about the best i can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read of course in my case it was read to me it may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read and certainly not to buy but as an audio book from the library with a limited selection of audio books to choose from it helped me pass the time in traffic
this is a bizzar of prorietary code tradestation language and 20 yrs old fortran code at the appendix i am wondering who will be using this code lot of spaghetti mathematics which is neither simple focussing on concepts nor deep enough to understant the mathematical details that 's very poorly presented in chapter 8 about uncovering cycles after all the poorly written mathematical stuff there is no mention on how to use the uncovered cycles in trading which is much more important than running after sines and cosines although i am a computer engineer with mathematical background i got lost i am forced to read this book as a reading material for certificate however i consider it a very badly written book with no real focus neither elegant mathematical details nor usable code nor trading concepts
my local radio morning show was raving about this book so i just had to order it what they did n't mention was that this book is full of the f '' word and many of the notes are very sexually explicit may be a selling point for some but not for me i just received it today and it 's now in the recycle bin was going to give it to my husband for christmas glad i opened it first
i bought this book for my father a national review i had read made me think it would be funny and a little crude a good guy book i ca n't give it to him ! way too many f '' words just nasty in places i do n't know i think guys at a stag party would blush if they read it
i 'm not a big fan of maddox the beginning of the book is funny and got me interested to read more i was disappointed to see the rest of the book to be predictable and boring if not it would be just plain stupid
i 'm not an ardent supporter of the present government in iran but i have an issue with the cover of this book and its title we are iran today real iranians '' if the people who are depicted on the cover of this book are iran then where are the rest of the population who do not live in the tony sections of northern tehran do not drink cappuccino and do not look so hip what is this book trying to say that iranians actually look and act like westerners that they are actually a civilized '' nation and what 's happening in iran has nothing to do with the real '' iran that ordinary everyday women of iran who do not sip cappuccino dress in traditional customs are not iran i do n't think so iran is much more than these people the people on the cover belong to land
i 've read all of flynn 's books in fact i just picked up act of treason as i 'm reading it i 'm reminded of how disgusted i was with his last book consent to kill only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one without giving away the ending consent to kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial that being the mitch rapp saga to any real fiction writer what flynn resorts to in the book in terms of mitch 's personal relationship is quite sad it 's simply designed to keep mitch hungry '' and emotionally tattered '' so as to allow flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he 's capable of writing the book started out to be intriguing although i did ask myself how flynn intended to keep mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel but the story read like a tenth grader wrote it a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping mitch rapp and his franchise chugging along by far the worst story flynn has written to date skip this one
this book is publisher by harpercollins the publisher of simpson 's if i did it ''
disappointed in this read i am afraid that this book confused me
there 's simply nothing useful in this book one would have to have never heard of the internet or the web and never to have worked anywhere to benefit from it the author repeats infosec and management bromides ad nauseum waves the bloody flag of to puff up the importance of the field and introduces new acronyms faster than the pentagon it 's also frequently incomprehensible due to the author 's poor control of english grammar if you 're in infosec do n't let your bosses read this they may think you 're as full of hot air as kovacich also note that at least 3 of the 5 star reviews below are by sometime coauthors of kovacich
i personally think this book actually having read it impartially is not good for any information security professional corporate or government ia iam iaso isso ect but if you had to place it in any category i guess it would be in the business management end of communication compliance maybe for a policy compliance officer also i really think that some of the other reviewers here must have been working to promote this book i unfortunately say this because the author creates entirely too many unique and extremely complex management policy theories on communication development which frankly gets way off the subject of infosec and even has him chasing his own tail in the narrated scenarios the author even goes so far as to concoct and create possibly new acronyms as if you did n't have enough already as a real infosec professional which almost became a little comedic by the end of the book especially when hearing even the author try recap each chapter and make each new theory tie into another new theory although i 'm sure the author is a very distinguished professional in his own right i unfortunately found this book weak to incorporate into any of my perceived information security plans do yourself a favor and skip this one and move onto the next and make sure the books you choose on this topic do not try to reinvent the wheel
like so many of you i love stephen king i really do he has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker but hey we already had to read gerald 's game ! at least gerald 's story was n't very long however wolves of the calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring also like so many of you i do in fact plan to read all of king 's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons but knowing this knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell king puts on the menu should n't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence if you cut all of the fat from wolves you 'd be left with one tasty little steak perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine instead we have a book that simply does n't do anything you know from the what 's going to happen in the end and in king 's own words out of roland 's mouth that 's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes after a several hour investment simply do not pay off i was bored out of my f mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and i did n't even have frank muller as the reader to help me get through the journey on that note i truly hope muller is on the mend king well he 's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it but if cell a very mediocre book is the indication of where king 's going is the best of him behind us now
this book is about a jewish girl named hannah green who flees from spain in fear of the spanish inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a jew she comes to england with her father and lives as a christian while following the jewish religion in secrecy through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy for both queen mary and elizabeth throughout the book hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother 's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for queen mary and what a wonderful woman she is it is well documented in history as well as this book about queen mary 's burning of hundreds of at the stakes a practice that earned her the name bloody mary the book is very sympathetic towards queen mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake only doing what she believed to be right in her heart '' the fact that hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a jew and continued to deeply love queen mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous i could not help but roll my eyes every time i read how much hannah loved and admired queen mary
first off i 'm not a fan of the writing style it covers so much information and time with little dialogue or characters for that matter but that 's just the style the way the story was presented was what i had a problem with it seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like and he did n't want to write an spiritual book so he just presented it as fiction but did n't quite know how to do that characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth then they drop off all of a sudden near the end they come back and now they 're like generals or something or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of armaggedon what ! this book is a grid a blueprint for a certain way it could happen it is not a story about people or a story with a plot it is just a list of events that read on until jesus comes the only reason i gave it two stars was because it did n't follow the whole at all that word is n't in the bible and even implications of one does n't say when during the tribulation it would be in this story the christians are here for the whole thing and everything is n't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the left behind series it follows the premise that throughout the last century or so we 've already experienced the seal judgements and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face if you want a different take and are n't expecting much of anything else read this but not if you want a real story with passion or voice
i would n't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie i would just recommed seeing the movie over the book
the million dollar baby was a bummer i mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book the only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story million dollar baby the only reason why that is good because it 's just like the movie and the movie is great the monkey look black jew rope burns etc are about pages a peace and they do n't keep you into the book as movie is the only millin dollar baby anything i would waste my time on
what a slog it is trying to get through this book i 'm nearly there i 've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends and the mostly rave reviews it 's got here ignatius reilly the main character is interesting enough that 's why i gave it 2 instead of 1 star but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring i find myself flicking on the pages to see how far i have to go before the story gets back to ignatius again i keep thinking ok the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon '' there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the pulitzer prize i 'm at a loss to explain its popularity
i am was a great admirer of doris kearns goodwin 's work no ordinary time '' was a masterpiece of historical writing but this early biography of johnson just does n't stand the test of time it 's much too theoretical and lacks narrative drive johnson was an immensely interesting figure it says everything that this book makes him dull
should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision '' i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle '' designed to make the question of 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side by normalizing generalizing and minimalizing 's crimes are we loosing our morality how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company be thoughtful
if you are interested in a diatribe against and how it 's ruining all the small towns in the country then this book is for you their is very little suspense if any and apparently the only way the author could keep his own interest level up was to throw in a fair amount of vulgar gratuitous sexual content poor effort the story '' could 've been told in less than 100 pages and was predictable from beginning to end with little character development
this may be one of the most frightening investment books ever written an early work of nothing down '' guru robert allen the book offers cookie cutters '' for making a killing in real estate as well as a handful of other tips for gaining wealth the advice can be divided into three categories 1. obvious buy low sell high '' 2. stupid buy high sell low '' hint run the numbers on some of allen 's deals often his leveraging does n't beat inflation for returns or the results depend on truly improbable amounts of luck with sellers willing to take pennies on the dollar because they 're just bored with ownership 3. illegal inspect your properties at least once a month '' in california the landlord does n't have the right to do a monthly do n't even ask about some of his moves with on properties you do n't own in the first place just back away slowly allen 's tax liens from his investment adventures around the time he wrote this book can be verified with an online search of utah county 's property records personally i do n't call a tax lien a sign of success '' and prefer not to take investment advice from someone whose credit is far worse than mine but that 's just me
robert allen is one of the many real estate gurus '' in the world who probably makes more money selling you the secrets '' to real estate then actually practicing his own advice i have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it i am guessing those who love his stuff have n't actually tried to do it the book has a lot of wealth building ideas but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully which is not the typical reader of his books he is looking for the person who needs to find the magic bullet '' for easy wealth and success but unfortunately you wo n't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book what you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work money and experience you actually need to be successful he spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing which is where he got his start but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard takes a lot of time and requires experience you will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales marketing construction and general business some of the actual investing ideas are ok but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work which will exclude a lof of people he also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while i know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information overall his ideas are average but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work if you can take any of one of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work knowledge learned and experience you must earn it will not be as easy as allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests if you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you wo n't get much more from it
this book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either a technical guide see wasserman and faust or a sociological simplification
this book is little more than recycled propaganda from about it is viciously and that is enough to make it a classic '' one of the great hate books of all sells always has and probably always for you aspiring historians to keep in mind if you want to know how wwi really started read harry elmer barnes or sidney fay
the people on this review are crazy this book is one of the worst books i have ever read it was ridiculously stupid and i hated it it was assigned to me by my ap european history teacher for summer work but i despised it i tend to like books teachers require you to read like the other book she required all quiet on the western front i absolutely loved it read this if you like explanations about anything she definitely gives you extremely detailed accounts on everything that is not important at all to the war you like conversations in books how did that happen i did n't realize people transcribed informal conversations between generals you already know military tactics and are in european history otherwise you may be confused during many important parts of the book you like war and do n't care about the human suffering involved tuchman is heartless in her analysis she barely describes any of the human stories of war you enjoy being bored you will be bored half the time you desire only to learn about the first month of the war i hated this book i do n't understand any of the comments thus far this book was horrible do n't waste your time reading it learn about wwi somewhere else i know there are better about this conflict than this piece of toilet paper
although i do credit this book with whetting my appetite to research further into lilith and i did enjoy reading it when i first started it after i did more research myself i realized how flawed koltuv 's research is she makes assertions while giving no evidence such as stating that lilith appears in germanic mythology which she does n't and she throws a lot of myths stories that are similar to lilith but treats them as if they are actually directly connected instead of just being archetypally '' connected she also makes the usual claim that lilith was originally a goddess and per usual gives no evidence for this assertion this is an ok intro to lilith book and is a fun read but do your serious research into lilith elsewhere
i have nothing more to say than i 've already said in my headline lou dobbs ' book was a big disappointment for me
it is truly unbelievable that a book such as this is published in 2001 racist in that all people have white faces until the author talks about foreign countries sexist as only women are portrayed doing house work and discriminating to vegetarians
i have all of nr books this is one of the few that i have not been able to read i have carried the hard cover book since it was first published from ma to california now to new hampshire when packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space i have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there i move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and blue smoke is going into storage that will leave room in the suitecase for her next book a jd robb i believe i was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as i did
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death i am a great fan of nora roberts and really looked forward to this book believe me it is not one of her best i started off admiring her setting and characterization of the hale family but then this went on way too long it also took way too long to get to the real story the middle of the book bogged down to the point that i had to make myself keep reading which is very unusual for nora roberts much of the plot was over the top unbelievable how many boyfriends of one person can be killed the 20 year mystic connection with bo does n't quite come off either i 'll certainly remain a great fan of roberts but no one 's perfect i guess
this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up
did not received this item vendor was out of stock so they cancelled my orde
jill gave me her recipies for prime rib yorkshire puddin mushrooms brussles spurouts pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home i got ta get her book before it is too late
ughh ! i was so frustrated with the main character of march in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it she was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her it was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character you wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter 's needs before her own instead she puts her daughter 's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath the daughter gwen was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother i also enjoyed her love interest '' her cousin that lives with hollis as well as her relationship with the horse for me these were the only redeemable parts of the book
reading the first chapter was the only time i actually enjoyed this book everything went downhill afterwards when i realized this was just a retelling of emily bronte 's wuthering heights wuthering heights is a classic timeless raw and beautiful here on earth however is just a poor rendition very contrived no spontaneity whatsoever the cast of characters in wuthering heights is present in here on earth i do n't remember the names of the characters in here on earth but i remember their counterparts pretty well there 's your version of catherine earnshaw there 's the counterpart of her brother hindley then there 's the counterpart of heathcliff ! surprise ! surprise ! a foundling with a dark and ominous character ! and then there are the neighbors the counterpart of edgar linton whom catherine 's counterpart marries and the counterpart of isabella linton whom the counterpart of heathcliff marries and then there 's the counterpart of catherine jr and 's daughter who falls in love with cousin counterpart of hareton son of hindley 's counterpart there 's also nelly dean 's counterpart and linton linton 's counterpart but that 's all i 'm going to say those of you who 've read and loved wuthering heights you know the rest it 's a sad thing that this is the first alice hoffman novel i 've read i 'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels maybe or i might be open to her other novels if i 've finished reading all the other books i really wanted to read first
i'am unable to get this message to anyone this is the second book i orderd and both books are bad this one starting on disc 4 all is bad i sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me i had the same problem on vanishing point the cd left will not play on my player i will not order another book from you once i can see this happen but twice is unacceptable
i found this book very boring tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper american i will read another of her books since she is so well thought of
having read a few of anne tyler 's books in the past i was looking forward to reading her latest novel at best i found the book to be wholly forgettable at worst i found her bottom line premises upon which the book is based without much merit i say so with some personal insight i was born in america in 1944 the first in my family to be a native born american and yes my parents spoke a foreign '' language at home among themselves and with their friends and relatives i was schooled in the local public schools and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds this remained true as i went on to college and then graduate school my family did not feel like it was outside of the american mainstream because they had their roots in europe to the contrary they felt blessed to be here and never missed an opportunity to praise america and all it stood for while our parents spoke a concocted language to us we called it germglish we fully understood their native tongue while we the children only conversed in english to them as well as to others our experience was not unique infact most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds now perhaps growing up in new york city is different from living in the baltimore suburbs but i do n't really think so i think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that all of us came from somewhere either recently or once upon a time and while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds i really ca n't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the american stereotype white protestant having ancestors who came over on the mayflower for this reason more than any other i found the book to be based on faulty premises and when the central feature of a book does n't ring true the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling
i 've read all of flynn 's books in fact i just picked up act of treason as i 'm reading it i 'm reminded of how disgusted i was with his last book consent to kill only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one without giving away the ending consent to kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial that being the mitch rapp saga to any real fiction writer what flynn resorts to in the book in terms of mitch 's personal relationship is quite sad it 's simply designed to keep mitch hungry '' and emotionally tattered '' so as to allow flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he 's capable of writing the book started out to be intriguing although i did ask myself how flynn intended to keep mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel but the story read like a tenth grader wrote it a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping mitch rapp and his franchise chugging along by far the worst story flynn has written to date skip this one
i firmly believe that grisham should stick to fictional writing his attempt at real crime leaves so much to be desired carlton smith carlton stowers diane fanning and keith ablow do a much better job of real crime writing and in a lot less words and for a lot less money
this documentary is not one of john grisham 's best works at times the book was hard to follow however he did make his point in the end i think grisham 's talent is writing fiction and he should stick with that
this book just drowns in the satire it tries to create it takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it 's just the same thing over and over again meet a drunk stupid noble befriend him and buy his dead souls if you can get past that the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired wit '' as people like to call poor commentary on a society
i have been a devoted hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical the story is just so silly i found it hard to keep my attention focused i compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which i do with my children on occasion sorry i just could n't finish it
this book goes on my list of the worst books i have ever read it took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction i had to read it for my ap us history class and sure it was very educational i have a test on it tomorrow so let 's see how much i retained it just took forever ! i spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful smokey mountains those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included i read all day every day and it bored me to death i constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days i liked the last chapter because it was the last
like a few others i do n't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews perhaps i was spoiled by memoirs of a geisha '' and the good earth '' but i found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring great plot line on paper but i do n't think the author did it justice ! could n't wait to just get through it and be done with it
beware of the everyman 's library edition of this book green hardcover ribbon marker isbn book v dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted according to the introduction this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low i wish i had known this before i ordered the book since now i have to buy a different edition in order to read book what a ripoff
another reviewer is correct in that there are significant portions of the book missing in the great minds series green and black cover in one instance i noted that 150 pages were converted into 14 ! also book iv chapter vii is missing parts 2 and 3 also quite lengthy portions of the piece go with a complete version if you 're going to bother to tackle this book or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea since that may be one that they cut out ! smith may be wordy but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work shameful to nowhere state that large chunks of this classic are absent at least be forthcoming ! if you choose a more complete version you 'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer but still a fantastic piece of work smith does tend to try to overexplain things but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point ammendment upon discussion with my economics professor it is possible that this green book was one of the author 's first versions which he apparently edited and added to more than once i still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work to look elsewhere
i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror doom and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative and this is exactly what insomnia '' is this is n't a spoiler just the author 's note at the end of the book we read 10 nov 10 three years in which king took to write this book three years which were evidently wasted the other king books i 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification insomnia 's '' ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with he is strong kind has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable his counterpart lois chasse does n't come across as identifiable instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph king does n't usually do that with his secondary characters other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable like ed and helen deepenau the three bald doctors and ralph 's numerous confidantes then there 's the whole abortion mess this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker albeit with a tranparently slant it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself 'how is king going to get through this ' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert 's narration via third person that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him this is a useful tool for a beginning writer but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning one last thing the villians just do n't work they are not frightening they are not demonic they are not vicious or malign three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors their defining characteristics are being small and does that really frighten anyone the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness then there 's the crimson king the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a catfish in one of the most terrible scenes ever rendered i rest my case
i 'd read most of king 's stuff during the uh decade of my ute salem 's lot and pet cemetery being the hook on the line and the stand shining christine and it reeling me in i thought he 'd never come out with a book that i did n't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife 's stuff and the gunslinger series then one day i started to read insomnia and i could n't make it to the halfway point the antichristian proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and i found myself throwing insomnia away i did that with cider house rules by john irving too even needful things with it 's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti catholism and hypocrisy but insomnia was just plain mean spirited
the stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner though it is well organised it lacks clear representation it looks like linux are explained in an organised manner could be used as a reference book but not for learning
diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation what 's next how about implanting a uterus after all men are stronger and could probably carry babies better big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game but for diamond it leaves the question open as to what are men good for '' my question is what is jared diamond good for ''
i sincerely expected much more from the author of guns germs and steel '' than this booklet that thrives on the trivia of evolutonary psychology it 's obious why is sex to encourage reproduction and i expected the author went beyond this fact bit it did n't and excuse me diamond how you account for gay sex in your reasoning homosexuality is totally overlooked yet it 's one of the mayor puzzles of human and of sexuality in general diamond i 'm very disappointed
president bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on pluto just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack a secret cabal of sceintologists have taken over the defense department and a working for donald rumsfeld who is actually ron hubbard come back from the dead right wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from jack abramoff in order to make money for tom delay 's trial samuel alito is actually pat robertson under a mission impossible style mask edmund burke and john adams planned the jfk assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations if you believe any of the above then you will love brock 's book if not then its not the book for you
it 's a long read the characters are boring and the ending makes no sense at all it is neither funny nor thrilling it 's just plain dull
i 've read great reviews about this book so i finally bought it because i could not get it at my local library never ever finished the book it was badly written incoherent story it jumped around just plain
oh boy i wish i did n't have to finish every book it is just a pet peeve of mine however i could n't get into this book i see no clear theme i know everyone was horrified at however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse what happens to all the characters one is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on starbucks another one goes back to her husband one runs into a tree while skiing and dies frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad jeez i was really hoping to like this book but i just am relieved it is over
i am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous but this was disappointing it had a promising start but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess save your money i wish that i could recover the six hours of my life that i wasted on this novel
i bought this book because i 've read and enjoyed wendy wasserstein 's plays and i knew it was her last work frankly i wish she had n't written it like many other reviewers i was reminded of books like hollywood wives in the first half parodies of lifestyles of the like most chick lit have about exhausted themselves without more it 's like been there done that the second half of the book if anything was worse either someone else finished it for her or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place i skimmed the last few chapters satire is the dark side of humor it should be witty and this book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work
full of painfully obvious cliches i was insulted on so many levels i do n't know where to yourself the pain run do n't walk
typical obvious placement and recently all too common italian american as disgusting classless filthy producer makes this book a real disapointment so boring to make the italian the new interchangeable bad white guy tired and boring
first off there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and do n't like to know anything before you read it like me then do n't read on ! what was this i love wendy wasserstein as a playwright i could n't wait to read this book ! i thought that it would be a witty satire on new york 's finest '' not the firefighters the upper east siders after i was sorely mistaken the first few chapters are delightful and engaging but soon you long for the book to go somewhere 307 pages later you shut the book realizing that it never did ! the political agenda being pushed was nauseating i daresay it bordered on propaganda ! i liked not one character in this entire not one at the beginning i thought that this was so that ms wasserstein would make a point later she never did you can tell wendy was an excellent playwright from the vivid descriptions of scene it was written very visually i hate to say it but this book 's critical acclaim comes only from ms wasserstein 's previous success as a playwright and her untimely death had she lived she would have discovered that she most certainly was n't a novelist and should have spent her time writing what she is truly genious plays
i read exactly half the book and stopped based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending that was a good decision as it is there went hours of my life i wo n't get back ! the book is silly and laughable the premise sounded great but the book is bad really bad
as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction however midway it turns into a romance novel i give it 3 stars for holding my attention a good beach read that can get you thinking a little about a time past the one star is a mistake and i can not seem to change it 3 stars
even though this is a popular '' version of the theory with the considerable advantage of being by einstein himself it is not so easy as the presentation may imply einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a knowledge it might be true in his time but nowadays the book demands a longer study in physics i offer myself as an example i 'm a literature student in level and simply could n't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points his reasoning is also obscure in many passages what are really those 'galilean coordinates ' perhaps these details seem for professional readers but they are not for the general public the implied target of the book in brief einstein did n't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization
this is a good book but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory for instance was not created by einstein as so many people people an italian physicist came up with it if you do n't believe me check any encyclopedia einstein suceeded in taking everyone 's work and compiling it this was helpful to the world of physics unfortunately this stuff is outdated and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book when it came out it was already outdated this was published in the autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 45 i believe if this was published in the or even the it would have been a good book
if you have read about the civil war in depth you will find this book maddening the stories lurch between naming the regiments in a battle line to skipping over large portions of each battle there seems to be no rhyme or reason in the approach to the information i suppose i expected a battlefield book that would give me a topographical feel for the battle where in reality the bulk of the book is a synopsis of larger events and in some cases the battles themselves another problem i had with the book is the general point of view that the yankees were a bunch of bumbling drunkards who by happenstance were successful and the confederates especially lee were brilliant noble leaders who at critical moments the fates intervened to ruin their otherwise perfect battle plans i literally had to reread the last page of the gettysburg chapter four times to finally come to the conclusion that the author states the lee won the battle !
the writing is witty but after 100 pages gets repetitive and predictable i enjoyed the narration but it would have been a better short story than a novel
first let me say this was my first exposure to jodi picoult so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent i ca n't comment beyond this book that said this was one of the few novels '' i was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through in addition to another reviewer 's comments on shifting pov for what reason i could n't come to terms with it unrealistic characters and scenes it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages pop lit '' came to mind immediately and while i tried to finish this book loaned by a friend i found it an irritating endeavor despite some popularity i 'm not likely to pick up another picoult book
for years i have avoided jodi picoult novels and if this one is typical with good reason for my book club i am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages the constant brief shifts in narration are too fast and give views on characters such as a judge who likes show tunes that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character the narration works for important characters but otherwise i think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel which is even with this technique infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again also the focus on the battle removes attention from who i think is the most interesting character the child faith if one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name faith white and the constant phrasing such as here is a story about faith '' 275 followed by he 'll do whatever is in his power to make sure i keep faith '' which makes me cringe at each repetition the child seeing or hearing god is to me the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention overall i think this novel is overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt the characters never seem real and i never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way try a different many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting
if you read the fine print this autobiography '' is actually written by alex haley so who knows what parts are from haley 's life and what parts are from malcolm x 's life
i did n't want to believe it i wanted it to be the diet that finally works for me foolishly i ignored the reviews here before i purchased it thinking the reviews were so much sour grapes i was dead wrong the only purpose of this book is to line the author 's pockets so he can afford to live in the hamptons another reviewer mentioned that all of the postive reviews must be from employees or plants to trick us into buying the book that reviewer was right there are several positive reviews but in my humble opinion they simply do n't have a ring of truth about them this book is worthless dont ' waste your money
saw on a news article that this is the newest diet craze and i bought this book to see what the hype is having lost over 100 i pretty much figured it out not to have sugar and stay away from white flours grains etc common sense is better than this book
this was hardly a diet book rather it is an infomercial posing as literature every other sentence seems to be about the virtues not of the diet but of a specific product macademia nut oil and not just any generic macadamia nut oil but instead only one specific brand not too surprisingly other reviewers have indicated that the good doctor apparently is the owner of the company i ca n't believe the positive reviews here they had to be posted by someone in the author 's employment this book was such an insult to anyone with intelligence another reviewer refered to the author as a snake oil salesman and i highly agree please save your time and money and do n't buy this book
when our boss showed us that he was assigned this book to read by his boss my response was simply because we have a union '' the company is trying to make salesmen out of technicians and they 'd like for us to think that in their new program will result in lost jobs too bad for them we ca n't be fired for not doing something that is n't outlined in the working agreement
as time goes by i have less and less respect for anything milton friedman has to say we should all remember that enron is the desired republican result of friedman 's structured finance '' what others would call organized and other scams and we should all remember that the freedom to choose among consumer goods is not something the founders considered important enough to enshrine in the bill of rights it is also important to note as does barry schwartz in his the paradox of choice '' that constantly being asked to make choices even about the simplest things forces us to 'invest time energy and no small amount of and dread ' there comes a point he contends at which choice becomes debilitating rather than liberating did i make the right choice can i ever make the right choice '' we normally assume in america that more options easy fit '' or relaxed fit '' will make us happier but schwartz shows the opposite is true arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological many of friedman 's suggestions for reform '' are gop platform that serve the hidden agenda of gutting america 's national security interests this is especially true of his school voucher '' program that will deprive america the nation of millions of intelligent citizens of the republic who are qualified to vote based on an understanding of national issues that goes beyond the superficial jingoism doled out at voucher schools '' which are in reality nothing more than the segregation academies of the massive resisters so as globalization transnational corporatism subsumes democracy it becomes clear that friedman is more of an apologist for profiteers and criminals than a major economic thinker
after reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about very close minded and not open to any changes at the end you will be like whatever
maxime schwartz was a molecular biologist and is now a professor at the pasteur institute in paris schwartz traces the history of medical research into spongiform encephalopathies and how the scientific understanding of how they are spread has changed over time if you know anything about bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease i do n't think you 'll learn anything new in this book how the cows turned mad is not a sensational book nor even a good book quite simply it is too wordy and dull
crudely written a negative hero deserves better and wharton has written some fine books sadly not this one
i really did n't like this book i read alot of the type books see my reviews of various brian tracy books for example but i really had a hard time with this book the constant character catchphrases see the title of this review the harrumphs '' and i really thought the whole blue vase thing was kind of dumb why not give the poor guy a test that might actually enhance the company 's bottomline rather than tempt him to break a window in order to steal a stupid blue vase that nobody really wanted in the first place why not send him after an impossible to get customer or something at least it was better than who moved my cheese
i bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers let me be candid the hell were they reading this book is simply insipid implausible and a waste of time get this for a premise geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the connecticut nutmegs '' ! nutmegs for a major league team ! ! yeah right it gets better has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the movies he produces hold on to your seats here comes the good part is going to be his star player on this major league baseball team ! ! why because in college she was an excellent athlete so some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball ! ! am i the only one who thinks this is plain stupid oh yeah there 's a murder along the way parker author must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise i ca n't think of a reason why it got published
one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters sunny randall and jesse stone robert parker has doubled our fun quite the reverse he has cut it in half the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes either sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more the villains buddy erin missy gerard moon are little more than vague names and stereotyping spike is relegated to a scene and a half oddly the only interesting character is a very minor one eddie but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is the is lame the boring worst of all who should appear but christ ! susan silverman from the spenser series one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction as with cold service '' and some others parker is just coasting with this one he is capable of far better
i bought this book after seeing a review in usa today perhaps i should have actually read the review my bad one of the best comic novels i ever read was by furst many years ago hence i thought this book might be entertaining in actuality it is plodding and dull with a protagonist who is neither engaging nor particularly interesting there may be a story involved but it 's not particularly apparent in the first half or so most books of this length i 'd have digested in a sitting or two this one has taken what seems like forever and i 'm not sure i 'll ever finish it unless something starts to happen pretty soon very disappointing
as i had consumed all my i sought something to fill the space of a long plane flight this was suggested to me if you are a jlc fan be forewarned this book 's diet will be very disappointing short on detail a lot of repetitive word usage even trite phraseology 's all here i have been told that this is not af 's best stuff and i have no doubt that might be true this feels formulaic hurried remember the movie foreign correspondent this book of course is not that story but it illustrates an unusual point for me ordinarily print has so much advantage over film in its ability to evoke imagination and supply rich textures after all the praise of af for his ability to evoke the moody i was certainly jazzed to get some of that but not this book i was consistently aware i was reading a novel unengrossed unpersuaded no disbelief suspended the movie tfc in contrast is extremely effective in transporting you to times it could well be indeed i have zero trouble imagining that a movie of af 's book would actually be more interesting than the book itself that in the hands of a great dirrector it could be quite compelling that 's how unsatisfying the book is
after quite a while i finally put the time into reading this book and i am totally ambivalent whether i should have or not i do not think that one should pay too much attention to those readers who do not take their history seriously to those that want to propound a certain ideological agenda something i am realising has been and is a depressing fact of american socialisation those people of the ideological left will love this book and the those of the ideological right will hate it that is a given my question is this what does zinn have to say for the historian for the thinking and well considered historian the person who well distilled in classic debates of history and the role of people power and groups classes in the grand scheme of things what does zinn have to say for those who were raised with a university education where the primary goal was to display an adequate overview of all major acceptable views and to show a mature understanding of those views '' not to argue just one side american historiography has a broad tendency to degenerate into opposite truth camps of the right and left mindlessly shouting out statistics citing dates supporting and dashing administrations to try to make a point the entire pursuit of knowledge has been subverted by a kind of default to crude rhetoric for rhetoric 's sake see any american news programme or most columnists and purile debate other countries and cultures shake their heads at such perversion of the whole idea of the way americans understand history so do historians such as zinn add to this atrophy of the brain or do they ammeliorate it i am not so sure i know the answer i am thinking that his whole style may betray an answer zinn 's radical '' style is deliberately unbalanced he makes no apologies for this it is an attempt to right the largely unbalanced scales of history written by dominant elites those who have and hold the power this is a worthy ideal but i am not so sure that a descriptive litany of abuse by those with power really says that much about an accurate interpretation of history and if it does not then what are people actually taking away from this book anyone who reads history and i mean people who read a lot of history will find zinn to be more than just unbalanced they will find him to be simplistic i was caught up in his light drama he writes well in the same way as one reads a comic book and then it dawned upon me zinn like a version of fox news reporting writes as if history were a comic book all evil on one side and all deprived and down trodden masses on by the other for the considerate person looking for a higher understanding there will be an amazing sense of dissatisfaction a feeling of being swindled if one is trying to achieve social justice there is a feeling of being swindled that may not be flattering for zinn but i got the distinct feeling that one was dealing with a in the area of history some of his research is hard to check he does not cite pages and i sometimes wonder if he ever cracked an economic history textbook he certainly would not be considered up there with the grand old man hobsbawm who is truly an intellectual joy to read and a leftist with common sense ! ! or lukas another leftist in his great big trouble a study of class in america '' zinn does not even rate compared with these historians so the question i return to is this for the considerate person of history what does one get from this read my conclusion is that besides some interesting vignettes on american inhumanity to man or american inhumanity to american not much even if american history is imbalanced because the majority '' or mainstream history does not pay heed to the downtrodden meeting diatribe with diatribe is neither a worthy nor reasonable approach moreover it is intellectually dishonest being biased for whatever reason is not something that historians scientists or social theoritst should try to be historians must try to grasp a modicum of understanding through the haze of sources and alternative viewpoints they must neither be hoodwinked by the codswallop of postmodernism or the absolute truth certainty '' of various historians that is the challenge for the historian indeed it is the challenge for any thinking human being if one wants to write comics that is a worthy endevour it is not however history for a man of his age he should know better ! you are thinking of reading this i would say that his writing style and capturing the drama is rather good despite the fact that his sources from the little i was able to check are horrible
dawkins defiles science dragging it down to the level of fundamentalist religion the situation is quite simple evolution says precisely nothing about whether god exists there can be evolution and no god or there can be evolution and a god clearly dawkins has some emotional need for there to be no god any truely rational person sees that evolution does indeed exist but they also understand that it does not fully explain the origins of life and it especially does not say a thing about reality on the level of god '' the level that encompasses the weird intangible stuff like the very nature of existence argue for evolution based on science and reason go ahead but conflating evolution with atheism just drags science down to the level of politics punditry bs it turns science into bad religion
i tried hard to read this book as an intelligent challenge to my faith only to find that dawkin 's arguements require a leap of faith something about how irrational he is about religion seems to dump his scientific mind and operate on raw emotion sometimes something more like hate at times the man has something to say but he really should stick with the things that he can talk about intelligently rather than straying off into a rant
i literally laughed at the case presented for evolution when i read this book because of the high publicity and reviews this book has received if this is the evolution has to offer i really feel sorry for people who buy what this guy is selling he has no evidence to back up his claims i was surprised that dawkins mentioned evidence like 'lucy ' and the moth ' which were proven wrong years ago i am a creationist as you can probably tell but not blind i picked up this book with an open mind honestly looking to see if i have been believing in something that is not there but instead of putting doubt in my mind i was reaffirmed there is nothing to the evolution theory besides man trying to put god aside and not feel guilty about it i encourage everyone to look at both sides of the story pick up a good book that presents evidence for creation and weigh them both and see which case makes more sense of course many people just call creationists crack pots and never bother to look at where the evidence is pointing if that 's you enjoy this temporary life because its all your going to get
if you and your party can channel all that hate against the real enemies of this country we would be at a much farther step with the war on terror but you are so blinded by hate for your fellow americans that you undermine every step of the way and put our troops in danger who are in the frontlines in harms way do n't think that the enemy is not paying attention to what libs ' have to say why do you think they sound like liberals on every video and audio tapes they 're quoting libs ' they 're listening i 've read your books did n't buy one of 'em but i 've read 'em i refuse to give money to a party that 's against everything i believe hate is just one of
whenever clint willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating saddam hussein and osama then clint and his cronies might have some credibility as it is their blind hatred and reactionary attitudes against conservatives have produced reams of commentary loopy ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world these pundits ' loathing of conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of america and freedom ironically it 's the conservatives who provide the strength vision and courage to defend the rights of liberals to spew their opinions hatred that 's what this book is at least truth in advertising is in effect here
talal asad describes his book as an attempt to give an anthropological reading of the meaning and history of the 'secular ' especially as it relates to modern western thinking what he does in practice however is muse on the various interpretations people in present and past have given to the term make some random observations about religious practices and delve into subjects only tangentially related to secularism like human rights or not at all like the 'meaning of pain ' the book misses any greater 'storyline ' or reasoning making each chapter seem a separate essay and not one very clearly connected to the one before at that now this would not be such a problem if the chapters themselves were insightful enough to cause the reader to view secularism or the importance of it in a new light but unfortunately this is not the case either i do n't know whether it 's the anthropological way of analysing things or whether he is just too modest but either way he absolutely avoids making any judgement or even a conclusion instead preferring to spend endless paragraphs pondering the genealogy of words and concepts every time it seems matters might get interesting every time asad seems to make the connection to current events or political theory he seems to rebuff his own interest in the subject invariably any mentioning of a moral judgement or a political analysis will be followed by but i 'm not interested in whether this is true or not but only in showing that people have looked at it in this way '' it may be that i myself are simply too uninterested in cultural anthropology to find that exciting but either way the whole book failed at even holding my passive interest at any point the subject might have been a very useful and interesting analysis and clearly asad is intelligent enough to make one but more 's the pity that he apparently feels such an analysis is beyond the pale making the book pointless and contentless
i think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they 're not living life they 're idealizing and rationalizing life some of the concepts here may be good but reading this book will leave you feeling empty even if you agree it 's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books
this is a novel in superlative style 'heroic magnanimous exalted brightly caressingly exquisite fascinating wonderful sublime radiant delightful ' it confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished europeans with members of a wealthy boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love there is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the difference between europe and the us at the end of the century this book does n't 'say nothing ' thomas hardy quoted in the introduction but nearly nothing it hardly surpasses the level of a stationary novel compared with the works of a dostoevsky or a flaubert it is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily only for henry james fans
i have often been exasperated with henry james and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game but i have never been disappointed by james until now i was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces portrait of a lady if i did n't know better i 'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes
i am sorry to say my expectations for this book were rather high i guess there just is n't much content in this book the number of illustrations are quite few and rather poorly drawn the text is as expected mostly sarcastic and full of quip and clever rhetoric however it comes a bit light when the authors attempt to grapple with the technical in describing the various bits was expecting more disappointed the book did n't even talk about the japanese submarine aircraft carrier and that project actually did see the light of day
as a longtime visitor to something awful i have grown to enjoy parson 's writing immensely when purchasing this book i expected to read a light humorous account of wwii inventions gone wrong in reality the book is a ponderous recitation of those inventions replete with plenty of technical details and absent of anything remotely resembling humor hopefully 's next literary venture will help us forget this stinker
just to let anybody who comes here from anywhere other than the somethingawful forums know all the reviews below were done by members of the sa forums goons '' i bought this book because i fell for the crap but it is poorly written not funny not interesting and could have been done so much better that i 'm almost angry at myself for buying it just a really mediocre effort from a really mediocre writer if you 're really interested in this stuff look it up on the net this book is just a lame attempt by parsons to get himself published by any gimmick neccessary
greene is a conman you dopes ! you 're being set up to buy this watered down machiavellian compost using the 50 of his laws '' that do n't contradict the other 50 he gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified desirable and trustworthy you 're all going to die sorry try to imagine what they 'll be saying at your funeral no matter how rich and powerful you in your dreams become by using the nonsense in this book man what a selfish prick '' would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment
the authors mistakenly believe the reader would be interested in ad nauseum details of their personal partying ! nothing new or inspired in this tiny book
i was excited about this book because i had hoped it would give me insight to gaining understanding about my emotional iq i found the content to be too basic to be of much help to me the storytelling style conveyed very little depth i took the online test which revealed little my scores were in the mid scale and for my age group placed me about 50 above my peer group the questions were very pedestrian do you understand other people 's emotions '' can you feel the mood of a room '' do you get frustrated '' at the end of the 28 question test there was a pitch to buy more of their services and material bottom line is that i got very little from this book and test i have gotten better results buying books on the hearthmath program '' google them and visit their website they are a org and have books also listed on amazon and would encourage someone seeking emotional performance and to persue this avenue instead i am not associated with this program just a happy customer i usually do n't write reveiw but i felt compelled this time
this novel of a century samurai 's odyssey to europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way but towards the end endo does get in a few good points the style is somewhat pedantic and staid but easy to read it 's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces the historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious from history textbooks i must admit i am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here i can only conclude that a lot of people who do n't really have much experience of japan think they 've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly westernized piece of writing by a japanesese christian remember not every japanese woman is a geisha and not every japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai 's sword
the literature of september 11 is never attacked when a book speaks of september 11 or of terrorism in general it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy jonathan safran foer 's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy on such reverence the narrative which concerns a boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock unshell the enigma of his dead father a narrative stolen in its basic outline from guenther grass 's die blechtrommel could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel the others include hiroshima nagasaki the staten island ferry crash and the dresden bombings each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity but historical trauma '' itself and the overcoming of trauma through creation oskar the insufferable brat attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father thomas schell a victim of september 11 by compiling an almanac of wounds the collage of images and letters which is the book we are reading '' almanac which most likely is written sometime in the indefinite future thomas shell 's manuscript of is heavily edited pp who has done the editing almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar if the term reading '' even applies whenever a pregnant '' image is described foer literally it in the form of a pictorial image when a flock of birds rises into the sky it is not enough that we read of these birds must see them as well words may not be left in their invisibility we are presented with supplementary photographs illustrations since mere verbality is not enough indeed the entire novel oozes with misologos the mistrust or hatred of language in terms of both its content and its form photographs yes and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes for instance typography does not substitute for a sentence foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities most specifically the responsibility to write well why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal as far as the writing is concerned it is composed of nothing other than repetitive phrases heavy boots '' raison d'etre '' etc and sunday school platitudes sometimes one simply wants to disappear '' 184 there 's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself '' 184 everything that 's born has to die which means our lives are like skyscrapers '' 245 how can you say i love you to someone you love it 's always necessary '' 314 whenever the author writes something that he finds beautiful '' and true '' 165 he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is beautiful '' and true '' the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus very deep truth indeed one that foer also communicates in his essay emptiness '' originally published in playboy with all of the sanctimoniousness and of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians ringo star and scientists stephen hawking are unthreateningly approachable everything is familiarized perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close since the entire book is a vacuum null space into which readers may project their own meanings joseph suglia the author of watch out
i havent get the book yet back order it is been like almost 2 months
this book is not as good as i thought it would be i hope i have better readings with bryan tracy 's advance selling
i am by no means an economist and much less an expert on finance but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis i 've seen much subtler discussions of the efficient market hypothesis written for general audiences enough of them so i can recognize that lowenstein does n't get it he equates efficient markets with the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value '' and not with you ca n't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do '' this is a crucial difference because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water the other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story given what his sources are reading between the lines i just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at ltcm is much too informed by interviews with people who 've had a falling out with them
so being a fan of all forms of literature more specifically challenging faulkner pretentious lawrence and original kafka works i was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what 's considered pynchon 's most imporant work important 40 years ago perhaps but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one oh man the radio station is kcuf boy that 's incredibly clever i bet it 's like something spelled backwards i fully understand what pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs among other things all while giving us a story with no particular plot no moral no message i can understand it but it does n't mean it 's worth my time i did n't even finish it i read about half and then just dropped it to the floor i 've read in numerous reviews of haruki murakami 's work that he 's a latter day japanese pynchon i do n't agree murakami 's ability to create a surreal atmosphere is amazing pynchon is a hack
like it or not i sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities thomas pynchon is one of those if the crying of lot 49 is his best work or exemplary of his work as so many say it is then perhaps he really should find a day job to use the cliche lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature it 's what happens when you take out plot character and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling i am very well aware that pynchon like so many other authors of his era are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless the problem is he is not looking hard enough to find it he is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading my answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century the problem is you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life and this book simply tells you that those do n't exist finally the content of the book often seems pointless and the writing is weak there is no forward motion and nothing to interest a decent reader
this book comes across as severely dated and lame all the people who love this book are either nerds who think they 're in on pynchon 's joke '' or they are nerds who havent read a good book like
crying of lot 49 flat senseless one dead accumulation of words in fact this book is at times so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders a book worthy of burning has writing become a whim of the well read a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness poor plot poor writing read umberto eco 's foucaults pendulum if you are looking for conspiracy do not read this book unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth
the only thing milton friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper ayn rand would have loved friedman 's disdain for the poor for anyone in fact lacking the initiative '' famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which barry goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a southwest ghetto and says why do n't you show some initiative why do n't you go out and inherit a department store like i did '' if you think the status quo was ordained by god or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with this book is for you if not start reading trotsky lenin and all the people with vision compassion and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet
leonardo 's laptop response i really dislike this book at first i was looking forward to reading it i am very interested in technology 's future human computer interface design and enabling better software through simplicity the combination of technology and artistry suggested by the title led me to believe that it would be an insightful volume pointing the way to a better computing instead this diatribe leads me only left with a feeling that the author is so full of himself as to be blind to the world around him this book does address real issues as computing moves from the back server closet into the home real changes have to be made software today is complicated and is frequently frustrating to use and learn however this author acts as if the computing world is ignorant of the cost of complexity his book falls short of actual ways to achieve these goals has no recognition of the technological economical or social challenges involved and totally fails to recognize the work of the past pioneers in achieving these goals he views computing solely from a consumer point of view ignoring the vast gains in efficiency and choice made possible through the vast computing infrastructure supporting modern day life as schneiderman puts it old '' computing is concerned with technology these researchers and practitioners are concerned with increasing speed decreasing cost and improving reliability in contrast he views new '' computing as a focus on improving people 's experience with technology this is a perfect example of the author 's lack of technical competence the only way that reliability is increased user interfaces improved and the experience of using a computer made more artistic and enjoyable is through improved computer speed and reliability as an example the aesthetically pleasing effect in the new itunes version of flipping through album covers relies upon powerful computing technology schneiderman 's dichotomy between old '' and new '' and downright distain for people interested in the former is in every field there are different groups working on different problems while it is reasonable to argue for one 's particular area of interest it is incredibly to argue that it is the only field of interest lastly i found the author 's presentation of historical leonardo anecdotes incidental to his arguments rather than being the basis for the book schneiderman descends into the meaninglessness of arguing that leonardo would put man at the center '' of the design process or would like portable devices of different size screens
approximately 250 pages of hybridised vacuity build from snippets of information coralled together i can best describe this work as almost entirely cliche ridden it is further evidence that human computer interaction studies are largely 'solutions ' in search of problems the chapter on ' is replete with casual opinion and banal anecdotes likewise chapters on the 'new education ' and 'new medicine ' are pitched several degrees below what the average time or news week reader would expect in content overall this is a poor piece of work in terms of content and i regret having wasted money on it at some point in time i hope that a shokal equivalent emerges to debunk the twaddle that typifies most hci work
schneiderman 's leonardo 's laptop '' is singularly disappointing promising to raise our expectation of what we should get from technology he instead uses a forced extended metaphor in the form of leonardo da vinci what would leonardo do we are repeatedly asked schneiderman attempts to answer the question sadly his answers are neither new nor groundbreaking i can not believe that leonardo would simply recount solutions that are already available and attempt to make such solutions sound visionary and the chapters in the book discuss the issues with usability today activites and relationships and attempt to discuss future directions in several fields government healthcare business and education in these chapters schneiderman uses buzzwords like 'empowering ' and 'enabling ' but never moves beyond the buzzwords to suggest real solutions in most cases he suggests solutions that are already implemented in others he simply waves his hands at the problem and says that there has to be a solution each chapter concludes with a skeptic 's corner this section could easily be the strawman 's corner in that section he constructs arguments that skeptics might use but he must assume that skeptics are uniformly moronic the skeptical arguments are drawn with exceptionally rough strokes which he dispenses of with little regard to very real concerns that can and should be discussed i had high hopes for this book i wanted something that pushed the boundaries i wanted something visionary instead i got a repetitive book that somehow did n't say anything i can only hope that future works give us something better than this
a uniformly bland book the author says in 11 chapters what could easily be said in a couple of paragraphs and then in the final chapter he completely loses it and embarks on some sort of ridiculous diatribe against ai research he displays an amazing degree of animosity towards those involved in this field of research some of which he names personally there are many far better books on usability available from forget this one what can i say leonardo would dismiss him as a fool
this has to be the most boring book i have ever read well i have n't quite finished it yet as it 's taking forever to push my way through it and i 'm sure that more boring books exist i just have n't read them i wanted to learn about kkr and lbos particularly as a division of kkr recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer i was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes but this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved there really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information and a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material it felt a bit like watching someone else 's home video it probably means a lot to the people involved especially as they 'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants but it 's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness i 'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway people do n't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years what are remembered are broad brushstrokes and this is what the author should have written there are occasional moments of entertainment like ted forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds but most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting the fact is i wanted some of this information in this book as it provided some of this albeit with a lot of suffering on my part i 'll give it two stars update well i did finish this book eventually my final opinion is much the same
i bought this for two reasons because i wanted to learn about lbos and because i had heard that the journalism was good and was hoping for something like 'the right stuff ' the cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed ' writing and 'all the suspense of a thriller ' the last is true only if your expectations of a thriller reach no higher than michael crichton the writing is a plodding 'you are there ' pastiche of the new yorker gulfstreams are sleak ceos are silver maned are bantams lawyers look like they model for gq etc investment bankers bark curse are struck by inspiration work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level stan lee would scorn i finally realised after slogging through the first 200 pages or so that 'barbarians at the gate ' is in large part essentially porn for aspirational middle managers there is in this book whom i would want to know unless i were a sociologist but i do n't even trust the sociology because the psychology is so superficial i did learn something about the process of lbos and for that a star is in order i did n't particularly enjoy learning it
this book is a disappointment kids may get a laugh out of it but they wo n't learn anything about eating well i hesitate to give it to any of my grandchildren
this book was not of any help to me it mentions all the aspects of business you need to be familiar with before starting one of your own but it does not give any help on any of these aspects for example in financing your startup it mentions geting a loan and using your credit cards honestly if thats the way to finance a business then you can add going on a diet and saving your lunch money it goes on giving you mostly unintelligent information and advice like buy a computer '' save rent work from home '' put your money on another book and save yourself the trouble of reading it
i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list
inspired by his uncle eddie who worked at an amusement park albom writes a tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience the concept is old a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths there are concepts to be learned from the five people the story is delightful and cavalier trish new author of the thrill of hope and south state street journal
i order this item becasue it was cheap cheap and paind about 3.45 in shipping well this seller must be using amazon as a con because they never sent the book and pocted the 4.00 watch out
wills like most christians ignores a clear fact staring him in the face from the historical records context and even what is called the new testament '' itself jesus was a pharisitical jew who believed in the clearly defined tenets of faith of the pharisites who were the majority of the jewish population at the time and represented the lower classes and the vast majority of the jewish population if he went astray from judaism '' it was because of his attacks on the zadokic priestly orders of the temple a dislike which he shared with the pharisitical sages and he was not apolitical because his brother ya'akov james '' is a known historical figure who was put to death and was a leader in the jewish great revolt i think christians should finally after 2000 years stop using this poor sorry man from nazareth whose mother was a simple hairdresser for their own personal agendas left right catholic protestant he was born a jew lived as a jew and died as a jew except for a few bizarre behaviors not as a christian or a member of the new faith but as a leader of the jewish people albeit a slightly blasphemous and strange jew that is all that jesus really meant
i am quite amazed that this novel has an average rating of 4 stars i had to force myself to complete this book because i could only read about 10 pages at a time before being utterly bored i believe the book started with a good premise a boy who can read '' photographs if the author had just stuck with that idea and developed it a bit more the book could have been decent however the author introduced all sorts of lame plot elements and characters all the way to the end it was as if she did n't plan the story and just sort of made it up as she went along in addition the character development was shallow i really could have cared less if any of them died the only remotely interesting character for me was uncle paton please avoid this book it 's drivel utter drivel
i like most of oliver sacks 's books i think the man who mistook his wife for a hat '' and an anthropologist on mars '' are major contributions to the understanding of the human mind i do have a problem with migraine '' however my experience as a migraine sufferer and as a clinical psychologist has left me in no doubt that the fundamental causes of migraine headaches are physical not psychological i have no doubt that stress can make the attacks worse but i believe most migraines are triggered by such physiological factors as allergies particularly msg chocolates red wines and cheeses or by overexposure to bright sunlight too much sugar or by overexertion or overstimulation with an accompanying lack of rest sacks takes a freudian view of migraine which i believe is inaccurate i now get migraine attacks perhaps a tenth as often as a few years ago and the improvement has not been due to psychotherapy or any earthshaking insights but to my avoiding msg and chocolate and to my doctor perscribing imitrex imitrex is a miracle medication for patients who can tolerate it it can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure in some people hence the need for a doctor 's prescription sacks has written some fine books but i do n't think this one belongs near the top of the list
i have been reading the navajo mysteries for the first time in chronological order i was sad when each ended and could barely wait to get the next one from the library until this one the plot is convoluted and far fetched with a lot of holes and i found the setting ugly and depressing especially the character of the hit man this is the second hit man hillerman 's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama hmmmm i skimmed the last 4 chapters because i was tired of both the book and the setting i just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because i was not enjoying the experience as i usually do so as other reviewers have advised do n't start here
if it were possible to give an author zero stars i would have this book is seriously flawed for two reasons first shamblin has a very limited if not confused understanding of christian doctrine for example she rejects the concept of the holy trinity and uses many fallacious arguments to support her beliefs i do n't feel comfortable reading anything written by a supposed christian with this brand of faith second her main principles for losing weight include only eating when physically hungry and stopping eating when full the majority of people suffering from overeating do n't care if they are hungry or full or not they eat for other reasons including but not limited to numbing fears dealing with resentments or to forget past relationship issues compulsive overeaters of which i am one will not only eat when they are not hungry but will continue to eat far beyond feeling full sometimes to the point of physical pain and discomfort i truly believe that faith especially christianity can help those suffering from overeating because recovery from overeating requires physical emotional and spiritual recovery but this book and the weigh down '' movement is not the one to help you do this your best bet is to find an overeaters anonymous meeting in your area and start going to their meetings instead
i was doing the new change series and felt something was n't out on the internet it 's a cult all the book is the mildest of all her me tell you if you do n't do it her way you will not enter the kingdom of 's all so subtle when you sit there week after week and watch the dvd 's it 's all about her and her son and so subtle remnant fellowship the only called out 'd better get in the arch or you are not the true followers of the gwen we are saved by grace through faith it 's a gift from god not of works so no one can boast ! that 's all she does is boast how sinless or tries to be sinless she is and her perfect have been talking to several people that she has judge and judged hard and it makes me sick ! just look up on the internet type in gwen shamblin and you will judge for yourself what this weighdown teaching is all not least you be judge and why do you look at the speak in your brothers eye when all the time you have a log in your own eye i never heard anything about god 's grace it 's all twisted 's fruit all right in these peoples lives well other cults have fruit too ! and the really overweight people if they are totally honest with you they starved themselves to get the rest of their weight beware ! !
after being involved with weigh down and leading a group myself i lost some weight but suffered worse medical conditions from it if your body is not used to trans fats from being on low fat diets like mine was you may shock your system i ended up in the hospital for five days and had my gallbladder removed sugar addiction is not easily overcome and if you listen to your body 's cravings it will tell you to indulge in sugar obviously this can lead to diabetes regardless of what your faith is gwen is giving dangerously wrong information about the body 's physiology we know too much now to ignore facts about our health and to eat like she suggests she takes no responsibility for anyone being hurt from it either do n't buy this book ! !
gwen 's well not that she invented these methods but she does emphasize them in the book basic principals of eating when hungry and stopping when satisfied are very effective obviously if you need to lose weight you need to quit eating so much but anyone reading this book should be very careful gwen feels that overeating means that you 're being disobedient to god and being disobedient to god will block your entrance into heaven thus overeating will cause you to be rejected by god you will not be accepted into the kingdom of heaven one must also be careful as this book is part of a full program weighdown workshop which is basically a tool for recruitment into remnant fellowship gwen 's church that 's pretty much a cult however if you follow the basic principles you will lose weight for sure i did lose weight but i also picked up some really bad habits like i stopped exercising and started starving myself instead i was so weak i had to take a nap everyday for atleast 2 hours to lose the extra weight but if you speak to the people who lost a lot of weight and they are truly honest with you they will admit that they eventually turned to starving themselves gwen suggests that you should n't exercise because then you are helping '' god take the weight off of you and you 're not being totally obedient by fully relying on god so by not exercising one has to eventually just start starving themself in order to lose the extra weight by the way gwen sees carrying extra weight as sinful this means you 're being disobedient bottom line i would probably try some of the other spiritually focused books that talk about the same principles eating when hungry stopping when full i do think the spiritual aspect is very important as that gives you the extra support you need to accomplish such a hard task as losing weight i have not read it but it 's been suggested to me by members to try thinwithin same principles but with god 's support not god 's vengeance it 's on it 's way in the mail now so we 'll see ! if you 're a christian pray before ordering anything and he 'll let you know what you need to do then listen and do it !
i began reading this book several years ago but quit due to a nagging in me that something just was n't right about it recently i decided to give it another shot and my husband a baptist minister became my voice of reason saying to throw the book away because she 's a nut due to her saying that people do n't need their medicine for certain ailments just prayer well i decided to look into it and lo and behold if she is n't listed as a cult i read some articles from former members of her cult which said that she encourages people to leave their churches friends and family to come to remnant fellowship out of nashville tn she lures people through her seminars around the country i 'm not saying the book is all bad the principal of eating only when hungry is a good one just remember she is not a prophetess as she claims and has no background in spiritual matters
i have long had the desire to read a grisham book because i have heard good things well my chance came and i was sorely disappointed the audio cd 's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber the opening to the book kept me going but by chapter three i had already decided this if sam cayhall lives i 'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes and if he dies he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the hero '' to the story '' sadly i pursued curious about the ending i 'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book because it only took six hours to get through it sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author mayber grisham 's other books are better but i wo n't be reading them
i was ready to like this book i wanted to like this book i 'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel so i began reading with great anticipation only to discover deep disappointment i have n't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one the idea is an interesting one intertwine the story of marconi the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently the problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing character development there is none tension there is none we know the outcome before the book starts plot plodding pacing the author gives away the wireless during the first chapter so there is no mystery at all no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader these historic naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book and there is no dialogue at all ! we only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story the author lectures us on all that happens historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading the murderer hawley crippen is so shockingly inept that one wonders how the man was able to tie his own shoes he is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife 's disappearance like she ran off with another man for example he allows his girl friend to wear his wife 's easily identifiable jewelry and furs right in his own office ! does he imagine no one will notice he even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy 's clothing all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy when its not being a history book this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the times of london a nasty twit killed his wife and was caught yawn i gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting i would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist 's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read and you found it sitting there in summary a depressingly dull and boring book do n't waste your hard earned money on this one
had to stop about of the way through it and give it away
as a white man this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it if an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published ! i am tired of the double standard ! thank god i did n't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library
interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring about half way through i had to quit it was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl will he call me did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me all i do is think about him is he thinking about me oh please please please let him say something to me i love you but i 'm not in love with you on and on the humor is mildly amusing but seems forced it does n't ring quite true like the author is trying too hard an earlier negative reviewer said they did n't like the author it did n't prevent me from reading the book i like the writing of a number of unlikable people but i now understand the book is completely about this shallow person his struggle with alcohol is one of the few things about him his colleagues force him into rehab which turns his life around he returns to work a changed and invigorated man loving life but continues to mock the people who saved him it does n't dawn on him to thank them
this lifelong cardinals fan managed to get through the book but it 's hard to imagine any non cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same though i am not an obsessive baseball fan have n't seen a game even on tv for nearly 20 years the stategies bissinger details are nothing surprising in context anyone experienced or not would seem likely to come up with them readers will learning virtually nothing here to give bissinger a break it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of lewis ' moneyball '' however the hardback edition of 3 nights '' perhaps is not so strongly positioned against that far better book but the paperback i read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing lewis ' book without a any understanding of it b apparently a rereading of it and c any evidence whatsoever to butress bissinger 's ya got ta have heart '' position likewise bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad lazy prose here examples pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as the great pujols '' no variations not even the really great '' of the phrase are used page 275 a player plays each and every game at five hundred percent '' page 254 a world series victory is marked by a rubik 's cube of a hug '' page 243 and elsewhere sultry hot '' as if sultry '' does not imply hot '' page 224 white hair as finely woven as pasta '' this is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests disappointingly the paperback edition at least does n't even have any pictures stay away from this one
first question did we really need another profile of tony larussa already the most manager in major league baseball ever since he popped up in the early the media has fawned over his every move evidently impressed by his ability to pull a and glower at the same time dude gets more ink than brad and angelina maybe they share the same publicist but if you 're as big a baseball fan as i it 's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of as the title suggests three nights in august a feeble of 'nine innings ' spread out over three games so the writer wo n't have to concentrate as hard i finished the book in two sittings so i ca n't honestly sit here and say that it stank or can i the central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject namely the aforementioned manager of the louis cardinals one tony larussa attorney at law in case you needed reminding according to one buzz bissinger larussa 's an throwback a 'real man ' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething ' geeks who would n't know a jock strap from an ipod nano yeah man those guys just sit in front of their computers all day crunching numbers but me tony l i go by my gut ! i 've got 25 years of experience ovah heah and i make my decisions the way ! if the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher maybe i will maybe i wo n't i 'm going to walk to the mound and smell him first think those mba moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like they do n't even chew tobacco mang yeah well interesting theory trouble is after taking cheap shots at such losers as bill james and theo epstein our man larussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing matchups that 's right the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going against kerry wood what the per bissinger we should n't rely on statistics unless they 're based on impossibly small sample sizes another flaw in this screed is that we never actually see larussa go his statistics seriously i mean if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself should n't there be some instances where big tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge or where t straightens out a player with a bad attitude or picks up a guy in a slump you 'd think so would n't you yet such instances are strangely absent why because larussa 's an arrogant jerk who does n't relate to his players hell he does n't relate to his either as one of the book 's better storylines makes plain the book confirms the prejudices held against larussa by his detractors namely that he 's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat this negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of making a move of being by the press or by himself perhaps bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the 8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit thereby allowing them to have their 1 hitter lead off the following inning it 's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball but larussa treats the issue as if he 's launching the market garden offensive dude it 's the fifth inning and there 's still fifty games to go ! pop a paxil or bolt down some jim beam you 're begging for this guy to relax ! but big tony never relaxes and his players never will either bissinger notes approvingly that larussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it 's the seventh game of the world series throughout the season as such his players are forever under the gun terrified their manager 's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third even if they 're playing the pirates in june his players will always press and ultimately they 'll always lose that 's another major flaw in the book the author presents larussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball while the little matter of his failing to win the big one he 's managed for 25 years and has won the world series exactly once he 's also lost it on three occasions getting swept twice fittingly he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very maxims that bissinger aims to debunk chew on that buzz blaming the loss on a late flight into boston sell it somewhere else bub the writing you ask let 's just say that boswell and angell can rest easy bissinger 's swinging for the fences ! on this one desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit a spate of phrases ranging from the maginot line to the hammurabi code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as the kind of existentialist hit that would keep camus or sartre in the money '' overwrought much i half expected to spot vladimir lenin the flak catchers behind home plate add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase each and every time it appears imagine a neil young biography that wrote about all his folk rock ballads or a book on bush that discussed the war on terror and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story bad buzz bad what was that story again oh right here it is tony larussa 's a genius because he does n't rely on statistics like those other guys except when he does and you can tell he 's sharp because he wins except when he does n't did i mention the author gives larussa a pass on the issue of steroids even though tony 's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem it just goes to show you never read a book recommended by tim russert the man who ate mario cuomo
i purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine while reading it i felt as if i had found the cure for my pms and periods i ran out and got some natural progesterone cream that was recommended in the book and started using it well all i can say is to proceed with caution after using it for just a short time i began to have a of my depression symptoms i have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self when i did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone i found many people with my same experience this book is very one sided and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them this book has helped many people i guess but i 'm not one of them

narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag comments on bill clinton 's sexual escapades but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars douche bag
this is a moderately book about the no spin zone '' should be called the know spin zone '' since really nothing in it is objective o'reilly is a in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this in other words it 's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it if you ca n't see through o'reilly 's bias then this book is poison
o'reilly has a grudge against cbs and dan rather after gi it standing with the bad guys '' in el salvador and argentina he gets no airplay then with moral righteousness he goes to a gay vacation place in provincetown convinced a showdown '' was in the making between gays and het families he gets no airplay too bad good for cbs o'reilly 's morality '' is psycho anachronistic hollywood directors celebrities unless you look like halle berry does a johnny depp movie really have to have a message he glosses over social and racial issues and suggests that al sharpton susan sarandon and puff daddy are misguided dangerous dishonest rabble rousers aside from the tawana brawley debacle i 'd have to disagree the tone is turgid the writing junior high the book is arranged so that o'reilly always gets the last word after each interview which is kind of sad especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors like mario cuomo bill ca n't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor he fantasizes about hilary clinton that 's even sadder each night while lying in bed i visualize the interview at last we are together in the zone her pansuit is peach her hair is perfect '' he tells the reader he has this dream over over quick someone notify the secret service ! he dares to invoke jefferson in one sentence and then decry secularists '' in another he reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth but he does n't even give credit to his cowriters or even acknowledge what 's shady an dishonest about himself

the problem with being is that in time people discover you 're hypocrite way to cheat on your wife bill now go after someone who does n't exercise your idea of family values
it amazes me that in this day and age a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book and which uses an maid and a korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast which uses time travel merely as a conceit with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships it obviously does n't have any impact on the eternally horny henry and claire can be taken seriously this book is a hillary duff movie cliches the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes racist black maids and asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes stereotypes hiding behind a love makes the family '' veneer this book was barbara cartland hiding behind chip kidd style cover art no doubt anne hathaway will star in the film
so very boring i gave up halfway in i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time my sister liked it though
i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion while it was unique it was too hard to get into i also really hated the story it was also too confusing to follow to strange to enjoy and to boring to care i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club the reivews by the way in the club were some loved it the rest of us hated it there was no i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors i 'm not sure who else would like it
i was very disappointed with a guide to elegance the information in the book is very dated and is not applicable to the fashion trends of today the fact that the book had not been updated from the was not apparent from the description i did n't find this book helpful at all and would not recommend it
i enjoyed the forward to the book the albeit brief reference to 'elegance ' being a package the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given after the 'forward ' i found the book progressively downhill sure there was the usual worthwhile guidance the quintessential little black dress less is more and choose quality over quantity but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion much of the text stressed silly outdated erroneous do n't wear black in the morning do n't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening choose neutral handbags in black and brown much prefer kimora 's ideas in 'fabulosity ' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry emerald or orange 's face it way more colorful and interesting women over 21 look better in one piece surely this is a matter of abdominal a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight old not so it went on to refer to queen elizabeth as a style icon as i read the book i kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend she 's 40 well groomed always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it 's all deathly dull there is no individuality no surprise in her dress seems it fits her partner is decades older 'a guide to elegance ' focuses on rigidity in fashion heavy on do 's and dont 's which has hopefully been surpassed by creativity interesting youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and my brother in law 's wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to christmas lunch and looked wonderful many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh shoes polished etc hair and make up well done a great walk and smile and then irrespective of any supposed 'fashion ' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant
while wearing more than one color at a time may have been considered risque in the author 's time wearing black and brown together is no longer the scandal she claims it was there are some useful points in this little book but the author 's continued insistence that one wear beige and wool even in the summer ! quickly becomes tedious particularly to those of us who due to allergies and skin conditions can not wear wool under any circumstances and given the english penchant for dressing frumpily it is a wonder why she continues to refer to the english as masters of taste the sad truth about any book like this and this is no reflection on this book or the author is that those who need to read it the most the deliberately shabby and poorly groomed are the least likely to read it
nora roberts 's books are my escape and usually a blissful one i love the magic character development strong women overcoming obstacles and romance found in her novels morrigan 's cross disappointed me vampires are a little over the edge for me but what made me close the book was the vampire with the protaganist i spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable and reading this put me in a bad mood king was a comic relief but he got killed that was when i did something i 've never done with a book closed it put it in the closet and later sold it i 'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy instead i took out the three sisters ' trilogy and enjoyed myself
just not my cup of tea well written but as i said not my cup of will not purchase the others in the series
i was optimistic given everyone 's positive comments and since i am myself in the process of designing a project management center of excellence i took a risk and bought it unfortunately i was n't able to find it at my local bookstore to flip through it first and now i know why nobody would buy it if they could see it first the material is appropriate only at the most basic level of project management capabilities if you 've been at it for only a year or two you might find it helpful but if you are truly implementing one as the title claims you better already know all this stuff and a whole lot more i wasted my money do n't waste yours this is my first review and i do n't usually write them but this purchase disappointed me
the novel was a and airport thriller this illustrated edition is an expensive and attractive and airport thriller for only
the amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread yet subtle socialist movement in america as well as in europe despite this the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality rawls commits one of the many flaws of collectivism attempting to force morality on immoral beings rawls ' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies selectively allows certain knowledge assumptions etc while conveniently eliminating others for instance empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems can not be known in the original position this is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative thus capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy if we compare the human condition prior to capitalism one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism 's downfall is immoral if it leads us back in this direction consequentalism perhaps despite this the people in the original position can not have this knowledge therefore information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world can not be used in determining its structure somehow though the people do understand the important of the right to vote equality etc this is absurd and impractical rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make rawls continuously attempts to explain his tweaks '' as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms on a side note rawls ' first principle calls for the right to vote what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his justice '' iron fist nevertheless it is quite obvious what rawls is attempting here in a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence strength status etc we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods this may be true or it may not human nature seems to embrace risk taking however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical natural condition while rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world essentially what rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent responsible hard working but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery because of this arbitrary distribution he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent lazy and perhaps even immoral ! i 'd admonish rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system poor unfortunate murderer if rawls believes that the laziest dumbest and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation this simply can not be justice as fairness '' nevertheless i 'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions as a warning however be prepared for a work that lacks brevity organization coherence and most importantly reality
inconsequential jargon this work is long insubstantial and boring the author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem the problem of universal injustice one wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work ! the title itself betrays the author 's philosophical incompetence a theory of justice '' has n't he read plato does n't he realize that justice is not a theory but in fact practice what on earth is a theory of justice which can not be put to practice right at the beginning of his book rawls insists on a veil of ignorance '' in order to have fairness to start with that is plunging into a book which has nothing give which can do nothing to change the world we live in we are not blind we know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf and know too well that there are differences separating individuals how can anyone insist on capitalism annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources can not sustain unchecked human growth and what is more he can never define what good are which must be available to everyone is raw materialism justice are we chickens in a coop absolutely predictable the author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse that is theory before practice have n't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results marxism too was an elaborate theory but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all is the unquestioned democracy the final truth before embarking on another long empty and pretentious theory '' without foundation a thinker should make well acquainted with human nature it is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities forcing nave students read this book discuss it and even worse write on it for those who wish to have a understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice i recommend plato 's republic academic jargon is not philosophy
apparently the difference between a criminal act theft and moral redistribution of income is 1 who you steal from stealing from the wealthy of course is moral according to rawls and bolsheviks and 2 who receives the loot the makes it moral and 3 who commits the act the of course also makes theft moral example taxation and 4 your intentions redistribution of income to look at this another way if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money that 's a crime unless your neighbor is poor which would then be moral and justice according to rawls ' formula if the community comes into your house and steals from you it 's legal and moral justice again according to rawls because according to rawls if before you were born you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured you 'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal or they would be compensated somehow for being born unjustly how by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more so those with more would be like oh say a who gets milked to serve those with less so those with more would become a resource or slaves to those with less because society '' the robin hoods and rawls of the world deemed this as moral justice rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk entrepreneurs students of life who work to earn an a '' students who earn an f '' he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own true but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference forcing the wealthier '' ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill is n't justice or moral it would simply be an unjust law some people see rawls ' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery and a powerful for earning personal reward and merit in a sense this book is an argument against the individual it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people he does n't recognize any individuals unless they were born as victims curious how do you experience life as a an oxymoron if there ever was one a collective or as a unique isolated independent individual there should be societal incentives to help each other okay but when it is forced theft of property always implies force it is no longer an issue of morality or justice it 's simply a law without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue by definition transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom
my goodness where do i begin typos grammatical errors and a ton of nonsense about life on the street '' i spent 5 years on wall street in various areas of the industry at 2 of the top 5 firms and another one of the top 10 firms i bought the book because i thought it might give me a basic overview of other areas i might be able to move into and plan a stategy to do geez i was awestruck at the amount of poor writing and overinflated depictions of life in spare me ! i was shocked that the authors made it out of high school much less college and prestigious business program i should apply to the school and tell them you ca n't tell me no '' because you said yes '' to this guy and look how he writes and openly acknowledges he 's an alumni member spend your money elsewhere find folks in the business you will fare much better this should get negative stars for a poor attempt at a book attempting to be substantive
let me just say that there are waaay better books out there on the subject even if you just want to get a brief rundown and you need n't even be a grammar nut like myself to feel antsy about when the next spelling or syntax error is going to show up because there 's an average of one per page honestly i could n't get through half the book but i 'm pretty sure there was nothing in the latter pages to make up for it
this is the second vault guide that i have read and the second disappointment that i have had with this series i really is n't a career guide at all just a very short back ground on what ib is you can find a description of ib on the internet for free the only redeeming value is the day in a life of '' but even then there are only a dozen pages or so in all you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet i wo n't be buying any more vault products as they have little information and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information
ok first off i bought this full price at a local independent bookstore so you can get it here instead and that price savings might be more worthwhile for what you get it 's really sad but i just did n't find it funny enough i bought it for a gift and after reading it now will return it and spend my 30 bucks on something actually worth 30 do n't get me wrong parts of this are absolutely hilarious but not enough parts to make it worth the price i wish it were shorter because such a big book should be jammed packed from start to finish with humor instead i felt like i really had to look for the funny parts the photos are amusing all 60 's 70 's retro stuff the recipes are out of the same era good housekeeping influenced etc i think it fails because it is too much in the middle of the road there are actually recipes and hostess tips you can actually use in this book but you have to sort them out of everything else all the stuff or if you 're looking for the humor side of it then yes the humor is here too but you have to sort through all the actual practical mundane tips recipes as well here 's my tips look before you buy and this might be a really good gift item for those under 30 and here 's my favorite tip from the book a good trick is to fill your medicine cabinet with marbles nothing announces a nosey guest better than an avalanche of marbles hitting a porcelain sink ''
as the title says do n't waste your money on this book i do not understand the humor in this book i thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality there is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting the author has a thing about teeth or one tooth i do n't understand how this relates to the topic at hand also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message i find dirty recipe cards unappealing i do n't want to make the food when i have to look at a stained recipe card the vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message i really do n't understand the purpose of putting it into this book the book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece
after all the fantastic reviews i was incredibly excited to get this book and turned out to be incredibly disappointed you must have to be a raging fan of amy sedaris to think this book is worth more than a few chuckles
when i found hour game '' in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i can not believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner '' and absolute power '' could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that baldacci hired an aspiring young writer '' to help '' him crank out a quick book i can not pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame
someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was halfway through i find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style it 's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing it 's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors i 'm not missing much
since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs here are my blurbs '' really hard to get into tough to follow who 's who '' '' opens strong but fizzles out early '' '' i literally feel asleep while reading this book one night '' '' you 'll finally give up without really wondering who did it
i tried many times to finish this book because once i buy it and start it i hate to just walk away from it but this book did it i was never really interested in the plot i thought the writing was very basic elementary actually slow and just plain boring i tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up but i never did get into to making this the only book i 've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing
this is the first and last book by david baldacci that i 've ever read he is one of the worst writers i 've ever read he writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a tom swifty sentence we 've got to get out of here '' said king menacingly his flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none the actions of the characters make no sense at all for example when michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick sean king she says sean do n't move ! '' instead of sean dive for cover ! ! ! '' bottom line save your money and buy something worthwhile
have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just did n't care hour game '' was like that for me the promise displayed by the pairing of sean king and michelle maxwell in split second '' is n't realized here if they became romantically involved all the chemistry would be lost but hour game '' suggests that with that option closed to him baldacci does n't know what to do with them if you 're looking for a good baldacci read heck a good read period try his the camel club ''
i 've read more than a few of greg bear 's books but have come across no books of his that were anything like queen of angels if i did n't know better i 'd say there was a bug in his word processor that removed all the punctuation i put this book down a dozen times an finally gave up on it i never could get into it becuase i like to read one story at a time not four i also like sentences that are structured i 'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but i do n't recommend it at all it will basically frustrate the crap out of you to try and read it
i could not get into this book the characters did not draw me in and hold me the language was sometimes confusing and you get these signs that i never quite got i read about 100 pages of this and put it down it may finish stronger but to me it was not worth the time to get there
i am a tremendous fan of greg bear but not this time this book totally misses the mark i do n't care about anyone
if you think you 'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting then you 'll enjoy this book
i was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing in an advice o'the day '' format of tidbits of wisdom the wisdom offered is good mind you but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you eg on a long car ride you will likely be disappointed i can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before i lose interest
i had never read a novel by tom wolfe and i certainly wo n't read another one tom wolfe is so out of touch with southern culture youth culture and the century that i actually felt embarassed for him with impressive diligence wolfe painstakingly mapped out the southern dialogue for the reader with complete disregard for georgia 's actual dialect hey tom not every southerner sounds like a century savannah plantation owner secondly at times i actually became physically uncomfortable with wolfe 's attempt to manufacture rap songs and names of rap artists in fact his book seemed to be a stream of stereotypes elaborated with purple prose third where was the virtually every character was either living on the hill '' or by the railroad tracks '' wolfe focused on only the most superficial aspects of atlanta culture including his tedious and pointless descriptions of downtown atlanta finally when i crawled my way across 800 pages it seemed that wolfe just gave up on any kind of ending a former tycoon became a stoic evangelist give me a break ! a convict turned himself over to the police the end
i bought this book out of curiosity about the movers and shakers '' of the real estate industry i know there have been obscene amounts of money made there and i was interested in getting an insider 's look as i know tom wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates however as a novel the book does n't really work it 's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of frankly i could n't even finish it
whilst alexander story is certainly impressive this book is certainly far below my expectations it lacks style good dialogues an intelligent subplot his life was interesting enough not to make the novel a bore a good description of the other protagonists one thing is certain a good and expensive marketing campaign such as the ones that stephen king has can sell a lot of books and make its author famous but will not transform him into a good on
hello to all those who have read this book after reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something why are you so set against god and christianity one of you said this book was what made him rejest christianity christianity is not some weird religion it is the faith that jesus christ died for all humans who he loves so much where are you going after you die christ is waiting for you to call to him and ask for eternal life the bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down it is god inspired there are more manuscripts and texts to prove the bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it there are more manuscripts than that of homer 's the odyssey yet we regard that as true so the gospels werent written right after the disciples were with jesus but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with christ i am going to wrap it up now but if you want to hear the real truth read god 's word if you do n't believe that there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the bible the age of reason was written by a man who hated christianity please do not just accept his writing without looking at the bible jesus christ loves you and he longs for you to accept him so he can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with him thank you
based on the advertisement at amazon this was the book in search of excellence it was not the book but an interview about the book i was very disapointed i still want the book on cd but feel it futal to try ordering it again on amazon as it is a nusance to order and return if you can help i would love to purchase the actual book on cd thank you steve kiewit 2543 770 623
i have to agree with the librarian this book is packaged like a book for small children but reads like a book for older school aged children and adults my kids did not see the humor even after i tried to explain it to them they just thought the pictures were scary and sad i frankly found the story a little past creative and venturing in disturbing
this book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a cd with numerous forms the word documents are very useful the pdf forms are not the problem is none of them are editable why even include them why not creat them in word format this is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time why even provide the forms electronically if you ca n't customize them you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them
first despite what the socialist apologists tell you walter rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some out of prison only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding come on it exploded in his lap for goodness sake mark hoffman tried that defense and it did n't get him anywhere either second championing the cause of the poor which rodney admittedly did is not the same as actually helping them or even more important for heua being a perceptive scholar rodney 's book is riddled with distortions fallacies and unsubstantiated premises one glaring example rodney pays practically zero attention to mediterranean africa for him only africa is the real '' africa why because his natural ethnic affinity for the area nothing wrong with that but then again you should n't title your book how europe underdeveloped africa '' but rather how europe underdeveloped africa '' rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman a straw man or almost anything other than the truth africa 's problems arise from its residents not from outside forces and spouting marxist dogma is n't going to change that fact it was known 25 years ago it 's known a fortiori now
the last river the tragic race for '' yes i 'd agree that this book is tragic tragic that i bothered reading it that i paid for it in order to read it that todd wasted his time writing it tragic that i disliked it so much that i can be bothered writing a review the warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket advance praise for the last river '' it reads in retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it it seems that todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal so much of the content has so little relevancy to the story that you soon tire trawling through it this was my third tsango experience i do recommend the outside documentary on the lindgren expedition hell or high water '' is not outstanding but is worth a read but on this book my advise to todd is please make this the last river that you drag through the wringer
although i listened '' to this book on tape i too was lulled into thinking this is like jon kraukauer 's into thin air '' hardly it is interesting and at first i did n't realize it was a true story balf 's book does give a bit of a glance at how a trek like this is set up the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek i agree with previous reviewers that this was no or let 's put it this way i was n't sitting in my garage after coming home from my commute to stay listening to the tape if you are a kayaker maybe this is for you having trekked in nepal i found some of the countryside info of interest but ca n't really recommend this book
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan i would not recommend this book
there is no other explanation the following quote is all you really need to know to prove that andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is i want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a shoved in his mouth like an apple in the mouth of a pig '' andrea dworkin if a man were to say something like this i 'm sure she 'd call for his arrest
to quote matt ruff in sewer gas electric joan met archie kerrigan in november of while researching a position paper on federal regulation of the genetic engineering industry kerrigan was an conservative a iconoclast whose favorite sport was teaching stupid pet tricks to the hounds of the lefty god he 'd first gained notoriety after a correspondent to the harvard crimson accused him of oppression symbolism '' for flying a confederate battle flag from his dorm room window progressive students mobilized quickly to express their outrage and demand the flag 's removal only to be caught flatfooted when at the height of their candlelight vigil a passing political science major pointed out that kerrigan 's racist confederate flag was actually a british union jack a photographer for national review just happened to be on hand to catch the squirming that followed rolling stone columnist o'rourke joined in the heaping of ridicule a couple of weeks later with a piece titled bean town 's culturally illiterate elite why johnny ca n't tell grits from a crumpet '' suspecting a tad late that they 'd been set up the reexamined the crimson letter that had sparked their protest in the first place it was signed '' this bit of entrapment alone had earned kerrigan a reserve spot in the lowest circle of lefty hades hellbound or no though archie was a crack biochemistry major with inside knowledge of the business he 'd worked two summers for phenotech a genetic engineering firm currently being sued by the city of boston for gross criminal negligence joan thought he would be a perfect background source or devil 's advocate for her paper but when she went to look him up she found the hallways outside his room jammed solid with angry women singing we shall overcome '' what blasphemy did he commit this time '' joan asked andrea dworkin '' the song leader told her kerrigan 's filed a complaint to block her from speaking on campus next week and they say that he 's threatening to do the same thing if alice walker tries to come in december '' what kind of complaint how can he block someone from speaking at a university '' it 's the new sensitivity in debate ordinance that the harvard executive student council enacted in closed session last thursday '' a second singer chimed in it bars students from hosting lecturers whose presence may create an overtly hostile environment for any ethnic gender physical challenge or sexual orientation group or other oppression category '' kerrigan '' said a third singer is claiming that an appearance by dworkin would create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals '' and what genius thought up this sensitivity ordinance in the first place '' joan asked i did '' the song leader said it 's an important step in the evolution of progressive society but kerrigan 's action is a total subversion of the ordinance 's intent '' well intent notwithstanding if you got this beast enacted then kerrigan is technically within his rights andrea dworkin does create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals it 's part of what makes her so interesting of course a man who 's read her essay on penile infibulation as street justice might not see it that way '' '' but the ordinance is meant to safeguard tolerance by empowering students from oppressed groups white male students are n't oppressed '' but if you make them the only group that ca n't censor hostile viewpoints they are oppressed '' look '' the song leader said you obviously just do n't get it if any group can veto speakers they find threatening even speakers with the correct point of view then pretty soon there wo n't be any speakers left at all that sort of indiscriminate use of the ordinance renders it worthless '' we might even have to repeal it '' the second singer added by the way '' said the third singer jabbing an finger at the rectangular bulge in joan 's hip pocket ' '' do n't even think of smoking in here it 's antisocial behavior and we wo n't stand for it
we were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and inability of see the beauty and wonder of view of women is n't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a distasteful act as male in her book is the aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing victim to only get children and love in she ca n't see the pleasure of the sex act then it 's no one 's fault but hers every page of the book was hard to do n't know why some people bother to read such books because it 's a waste of trees paper and time ! another problem is she makes it sound as though women who like intercourse are n't up to her intellectual level as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse she tries to make very subjective material sound like it 's supposed to be the objective norm for every ! ! ! very dangerous book
if you believe that all men are out to get you if you believe that all men are potential rapists or if you believe that sex is a weapon men use to opress women then this is the book for you ! i imagine you will read the book while looking tentatively over your shoulder fearing some evil man may pass by i always weigh every book i read objectively trying to find a balance and see both sides of the argument however andrea dworkin makes this an impossible task for any sensible and rational person even a cursory inspection of this book will make it a glaring certainty that the themes here are paranoia hate and fear if you believe the psychotic rantings of andrea dworkin all men hate all women this is n't a negotiable idea and sex could n't possibly be an act that a woman might consensually enjoy with a man no if you believe the ravings of this madwoman all men are rapists that use sex to keep women in their place '' no woman ever really '' wants to have sex with a man but alas women are forced to have sex with men and if a man ever sees a woman experiencing happiness he immediately devises a way to rob her of it give me a break if you enjoy or agree with these kind of theories do n't have a penis or are lacking common sense then you will love this book it 's funny how andrea dworkin preaches high and blind in her lunatic ivory tower about the need for a woman to control her own life yet goes on to tell women that they can not be happy with a man or enjoy sex with one which takes away the exact choice she rages about one thing she professes in no uncertain terms is that if you 're a woman that does not agree with her then you are a detriment to all woman in the real world we call people like her dictators even more irritating than her inane diatribes is her complete and total lack of credible evidence or argument there are no facts only paranoid opinions andrea dworkin truly believes that the whole of the male species is out to get her what 's really disheartening about all this is that there are so many women fighting for true equality and not the complete subjugation men unfortunately paranoia is contagious and a few other women have turned to this sort of radical feminism studies have shown time and again that the vast majority of these radical feminists have been either raped or molested at some point in their lives so it 's safe to say that these women are extremely biased provide no evidence of any kind and make up blatant lies to support their cause '' and yet they purport to speak for all women it 's clear that these women just like andrea dworkin are the real detriment to women everywhere but i 'm not worried most women like myself still love men and will continue to ignore the ravings of the lunatic fringe and that makes the radicals madder than anything i ca n't believe i wasted 2 hours of my life reading this ridiculous drivel
hey here 's an idea what if hitler was right all along only it is men not jews who are to blame for all the woes of the world we should build a new auschwitz and exterminate them all right andrea in my opinion this is just as bad as any misogynist it 's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women 's liberation movement back for so long
this book seems to me to be another hoax of the type which appeared during the years following wwii the diary '' is written like a novel with plenty of dialogue the book focuses on rape and seems to have been written to appeal to prurient curiosity it just does n't ring true for example near the end the author writes that she gave her diaries to her former sweetheart to read 'what 's this supposed to mean ' he asked pointing to 'schdg ' i had to laugh 'schandung ' of course rape '' oh yes ha ha very funny i 'm sure the mass rapes of the german women after the fall of berlin were just a hoot especially to those who experienced it no wonder the book met with hostility and criticism when it was first published in 1954 the book definitely demeans the horror of the experience the berlin women survived the true identity of the author '' anonymous '' has never been known doubts over the authenticity of this diary '' have dogged the book since it was first published in the introduction it states that experts on personal documents from the period have confirmed that the diary 's transcript is original and completely genuine '' now that 's hilarious ! just how did they confirm that carbon dating i 'm just glad i did n't buy the book i borrowed it from the library yesterday and i can return it there today i would n't want to put money in the pockets of anyone associated with profiting in this disrespectful way off of the tragedies of victims of wwii
i read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that i was not in the right space to appreciate this book when i read it this was the most boring piece of literature ever written i know it was a period of age story but pages upon pages of people picking cotton talking about cotton and talking about picking cotton zzzzzz took me forever to finish because i kept passing out and having nightmares yep cotton
i hate to rain on everybody 's parade but i found this book to be a rehash of stuff i 've read over and over in other places there 's too many numbers in here what people need is an attitude about money not just save so much money for so long at 10 interest per year and you 'll have so much saved for retirement at 65 but if you wait until you 're 35 to start you 'll only have this much saved '' that 's not a quote from the book but you can place that quote in almost any financial book and it will fit just fine personally i thought the millionaire next door was better and rich dad poor dad in a leauge of its own any book on this subject will certainly convey some '' information the problem is that they are too number oriented people need to focus on paying themselves first regularly having a set savings program and intelligent investments this book seems to be more focused on getting rich by retirement that 's just great but anybody who saves money over years darn well better be rich by retirement or they do n't know what they are doing on the other hand i think the authors are realistic in the sense that this is not get rich quick by any means if you want to sum it all up no matter who you are or what your circumstances are save money on a regular and consistent basis cut up all of your credit cards pay cash for everything keep your wants and spending under control and that 's about it really it 's not that hard to get rich i just wish the book had more practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers and statistics
this is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself this book did n't really make me feel anything i never got so that i cared about the characters i never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either this is one of the books that you know you read but you just ca n't really remember later on i would n't recommend this
the second tape does not move backwards or forwards i am very diappointed
crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory the plot is laughable the writing is sloppy the dialogue is didactic this is trash not even good trash too bad to see the author of andromeda strain sink so low shame on him
i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references '' to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility '' but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet
may be as damaging as out and out lies i think crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth one of these that i found most disturbing was the antagonists statement that ddt was not proven to be harmful maybe so but the chemical reaction something that happens quite often in nature ddt has with some soils leads to dde which is very harmful to native species it reminds me of bowling for columbine whether you like micheal moore or not he had a thesis about how afraid americans are made to feel why do you lock your door at night if someone wants to get in they will moore touches on but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in american society crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups he portrays these organizations very well however the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world check the fbi website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago !
this book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language facial expression and more the facts laid out are informative the prose though has much to be desired thu author uses tacit '' far too frequently and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words commas and are not in expected places leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning i felt i had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along good scientific work but bad read
social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study this book does it a disservice this book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas you might find something that interests you but you 're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it honestly i expected better from daniel goleman and i was quite disappointed by this book unfortunately i do n't yet have a better book to recommend instead
i was very disappointed that this cookbook did n't have more comfort food recipes it used ingredients that you would n't normally have on hand i was looking for recipes for meatloaf mac cheese i wo n't buy another cookbook that i ca n't review first
i returned this book as i did not see that much that i would cook
if you 're tempted to buy this hugely expensive book for an unwieldy paperback printed on paper think again let me complement the book description for you each concept is very superficially presented in a full or spread illustrated with pictures of works of art that are not examined in an enlightening way the book is basically a long list of design principles so shallowly presented that it 's just that a list if a competent teacher were to transform this book into a slide show and orally explore each principle it would probably make good material for three or four classes
i was very disappointed in this book thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only who cares about the daily life of the corporate ceo i wanted to know the man what were his parents like what kind of a childhood did he have how about some pictures of jack the kid who was his wife of twenty eight years what are her opinions of jack as a man and a father how about his children do they have insights into their fathers feelings what experiences in his life molded him into what he became these and many other questions were not answered how can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes try it again janet the third time never fails
i have all of nr books this is one of the few that i have not been able to read i have carried the hard cover book since it was first published from ma to california now to new hampshire when packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space i have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there i move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and blue smoke is going into storage that will leave room in the suitecase for her next book a jd robb i believe i was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as i did
mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend 's death i am a great fan of nora roberts and really looked forward to this book believe me it is not one of her best i started off admiring her setting and characterization of the hale family but then this went on way too long it also took way too long to get to the real story the middle of the book bogged down to the point that i had to make myself keep reading which is very unusual for nora roberts much of the plot was over the top unbelievable how many boyfriends of one person can be killed the 20 year mystic connection with bo does n't quite come off either i 'll certainly remain a great fan of roberts but no one 's perfect i guess
this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up
this book is an overview it does not cover the details that are required for cissp i found more helpful resources pdf ppt doc on the internet free of cost save some money and buy shon harris 's or wiley 's exam prep guide instead that is what i did
since i loved jurassic park and the andromeda strain way back in high school i happily picked up congo at the airport what an enormous disappointment the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half nonsensical details are never explained what 's with the gray gorillas and the paddles the gorillas were trained by the back in the day to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it this is never made clear the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up and the characters are ridiculously this is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you 're sol the plot is not going to come together and you 're not going to be satisfied that plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology left me entirely cold this book hit the airport trash can the minute i debarked
like jurassic park '' this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters my reasons for such an accusation 1. crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts and while these can be quite interesting they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline dan brown for instance is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity as a result the book comes off as slow and stumbling 2. the plot is n't all that interesting to begin with vengeful gorillas talking gorillas misanthropic gorillas come on 3. the book 's ending is utterly terrible 4. cricton 's writing is weak and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing sorry michael but this book just did n't do it for me
i looked forward to reading this book because it was presented to me as definitive in its field much to my chagrin what i read sounded as calm and reflective as something that might have been issued from the union war office in 1863. cash has nothing good to say for the south which is why this piece of cheap propaganda is a classic '' after reading about two hundred pages i looked at the paragraph or two about the author which stated what i had already suspected cash was a southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself if you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete then i recommend the mind of the south a book in which we learn much about cash 's mind in though next to nothing about the real south that this book is often foisted on unsuspecting students fills me with loathing
once a book becomes a bestseller it becomes difficult to find negative reviews of that book this book maybe a bestseller but i do n't think a will be able to follow the author unless one is prepared to exert oneself mentally to a great extent one should not even attempt to read this book one of my friends who is a physics undergraduate recommended it to me i am a pharmacist and eventhough i learnt a few surprising things from this book here and there i was unable to understand it and untimately had to leave it only
i was raised in virginia and never understood the details of the battle of yorktown now i see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together immediately after finishing this book i returned to yorktown with an entirely different understanding i could relive the battle as if i had been there during the war it was fascinating ! i never learned this from history books male age 60
yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author does n't know how to write my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author 's alternative grammatical rules comma splices and sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading the following example is but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes '' he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand '' one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several sentences in a row like this the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft i do n't understand how authors get away with publishing such work and i do n't understand why readers put up with it another problem is the lack of convincing characterization everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home i think you get the picture few characters stand out on their own even lafayette is just another young officer the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book and shaara 's attempts at making his characters witty never work the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull beyond that i 'm doubtful about the author 's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter it 's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin 's mind but the rest of the time it does n't work well i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus either i 'm a lazy reader and i 'm not or the device is n't working well in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america in effect this novel is really about washington 's military camp and howe 's dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced some aspects of the story are interesting i enjoy reading about washington 's maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when but i wish now that i 'd just bought a decent beginner 's history on the war most of the book as literary fiction left me cold
this is one of the best books i have ever read on the revolutionary war even though it is technically classified as a novel it is accurately presented history shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book and presented the historical events accurately as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable the main participants in the revolutionary war were presented not as gods but as truly great and courageous men and women he also presented the details of battles troop movements condition of troops and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events i have a better understanding of the revolutionary war years than i have ever had and would highly recommend this book to every american who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country
the glorious cause '' is the sequel to rise to rebellion '' and since the first novel was so good i eagerly dove into this one but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization on a scale of 1 to 10 i give it a 4 as compared to the 8 i would give rise to rebellion '' the events recounted in rise to rebellion '' involving the lead up to the revolutionary war seemed so much more detailed and interesting with a vast array of characters that were so colorful john adams paul revere samuel adams ben franklin and others the glorious cause '' was not without its merits but it seemed so much drier and less appealing with a more narrow focus it was far too long in some parts to the point my attention wandered and getting through it was a chore in some sections unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages i listened to this book on audio tape during my commute and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene one element i felt truly slighted by was the coverage of benedict arnold and his defection to the british cause i assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material a mark of a good book is how i feel when i have finished reading it if i am disappointed i have reached the end of the story then i know it was time well spent getting to the end of the glorious cause '' felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project it was uncomfortable work and now that i 'm done i feel i can do something a bit more interesting because shaara did such a good job with rise to rebellion '' i do n't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility perhaps the subject matter did n't complement my taste as well i prefer interesting historial detail over tepid droning battle descriptions and i feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between rise to rebellion '' and the glorious cause
i was really excited about getting this book after reading all the reviews it appeared as if there was something new out there then i read it and i am truly disappointed it really is more of the same i have read these concepts over and over time and time again in various books and in the varying schools of metaphysical teachings yes sometimes they work yes sometimes they do n't even here with bob 's concepts they still do n't work some of the time so what 's new the concepts seem to have been honed from varying resources some which were very recognizeable the give me this or something better i also was bothered by the author pointing one to watch the truman show and other outside materials for a better concept of what his book was supposed to be aimed at explaining to you his grasp of the inner ceo also was very one dimentional and i never did get a good feel for that one would think if the book is based on working with your inner ceo '' better known to most who have been around the block your higher self or subconscious and working the network better known as jung 's collective unconscious you would first need a good feel for the inner ceo '' to begin with i felt the author fell really flat there i gave it one star for one reason i had no other choice and i suppose it is worthy of one star as there are some people obviously from the reviews that just have n't been exposed to the metaphysical concepts of life all in all i suppose it is just another book with another secret method that if followed diligently step by step you will succeed at manifesting your desires of the time ! !
bob scheinfeld outlines an interesting and intelligent approach to the application of a universal spiritual principle in a secular context namely how to build and benefit from a relationship with your higher self or your inner ceo '' as bob puts it the strength of this material lies firstly in its language and style of presentation which successfully avoids any religious or '' jargon and secondly in its structured and systematic approach as to how to apply this principle my main criticism of this book is that it is positioned as the missing or secret factor that is required to achieve wealth and success but as bob tells us on becoming successful in business or becoming wealthy may not be part of your mission or life purpose '' throughout the book bob stresses the critical importance of your mission or life purpose '' as the ultimate determining factor as to whether or when wealth and success will be achieved it would be more accurate and truthful and ultimately more helpful to the majority of people who may not be destined for great wealth and material success if the primary focus of the book was on how to establish and fulfill your personal mission or life purpose '' but perhaps that angle would n't sell as well however i do recommend this book follow the steps and processes that are so clearly outlined and then use them to discover and fulfil your mission or purpose in life which may or may not include wealth and material success !
the title of the book is great and it 's full of beautiful b w pictures but the content is a nicely bound collection of ramblings it reminded me of the time i was in school and wanted to compose essays without much thinking or researching the subject nice marketing campaign to publish those one of the examples the author was inside of the 's with a group of students who were shouting and laughing and then he left the building and its atmosphere and went into the church where he felt the atmosphere could not of been more different making him look harder at trivial things and either more architectural facts or more philosophical thinking would make this book interesting
when i picked up true believer i was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters neither panned out this book is boring the characters are and there is no mystery too much detail and not enough substance not sure what the point of the story was as i did n't get it
not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected i did n't really connect with the main characters i was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects the lights it seemed like a story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story
this book proves once again that you do n't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market true believer '' is an team of cheap shallow cliches there is no plot no one really believes anything and everything is a contrived superficial the dialoge has no depth and when you 've had too much dialoge there 's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters thinking '' to themselves wow is this bad message in a bottle '' was a great plot idea but its been a slow steady descent since then you might have a good laugh at it like i did but otherwise i was very disappointed
i have 50 pages to go and i ca n't wait to finish this boring waste of time very predictable sappy sweet and quite meaningless i give it a minus 1
just for everyone 's information and my own ego although i am listed as the author of both the first and second editions of this book and i did write the first edition the second edition was produced without my participation i take no responsibility for the second edition i am currently updating the book and a third edition written in the style of the first edition will be available soon jo lynn southar
if you read this book looking for ways that your product company or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with tipping point gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it was n't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated he builds up a theory of things needing to be sticky which is fine but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory anyway the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he 's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read
the author of this book was obviously not applying emotional intelligence '' principles when writing this book the points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important but it was just not done in a good manner i do not typically shy away from long books but this one was impossible it was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book and can i tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing just know that to be successful you have to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive kind and generally good person to work with if you do n't believe me save yourself the and buy the cliffs notes
the idea behind the book is great but the book itself fails to meet expectations the description on native american life seemed superficial and like it had no experience or research behind it the charachters were good but the whole book seemed like a rough story never went into enough detail it jumped from one event to another without ever spending enough time on each event to interest advice is to skip it
this was my first jance novel and probably my last i am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable many false assertions regarding the catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in new mexico as if it was a known fact the most offensive reference being that god clearly must be a woman do not buy from this author if morally conservative
if you like this book you will probably like bless the child '' by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple characters simple plot applied loosely and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage ! i ca n't describe everything wrong with this book because there 's not enough time if it 's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it 's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it 's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author 's plea for that is irritating that 's how bad this book is ! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i 've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published
do yourself a favor do n't waste your time with this book
i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller goes to show you some people have really bad taste the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog it seems like the author was being paid by the word too much repetition entire scenes which added nothing to the story etc i would never purchase another book by this author glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can charli
first off i am an avid reader and love a long challenging read however this novel is one of the worst i have ever read ! it is long boring and has absolutely no plot i purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews although from the looks of most of them here i personally suspect that many of those who raved never actually read the book
ive read dozens of reviews for this book the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place they are all false ! this book is boring i dont see any reason to compare this book to the harry potter series other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman they 're not even in the same category ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count and this was the worst by far the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to make it rain '' or make the statues talk '' if your looking for a good fantasy novel try salvatore or weis hickman this just isnt worth the time i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an amazing book this is the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish for some reason i just wanted to know how it ended i normally read about 2 books a week this one took me over a month to finish its just so boring i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair if you want real fantasy try something else please
while i liked parts of this book very much it needed editing the sequence near the end in venice was pure agony and i came ever so close to giving up however having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book while the last few chapters helped to redeem the book all in all the book disappointed including the apparent tee off for a second volume assuming there is a sequel i 'm not likely to purchase it
once upon a time i thought jeff sachs was both a genius and a tower of integrity i read this tragic work this book is the result of what happens when a brilliant mind goes hollywood '' as a financial economist who actually lives in africa it is obvious to me that jeff is selectively clueless about how things really work here then again i think jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the un want to hear
although i appreciate sachs effort his book lacked a new approach to ending poverty it is a comprehensive eye opening book for people without in depth knowledge of poverty and development but for many scholars this book must have been a yes we already know '' the book is more a moral we should '' rather than a practical guide for people interested in ending poverty because it does not offer new solutions we have long known what we should do on a micro level as well as in large scale programming but how to actually make it work is a different thing how do we get governments to meet the gdp promise how do we lower trade barriers open markets build infrastructure gender equality etc i will start the white man 's burden '' today i can use a good dose of grass root development realism
i wish sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels that flow and voice i understood so well at first sight felt like i was reading a deadline novel just words no insight did n't make this reader think at all sorry just the way i read it
i gagged my way through the notebook but thought i would give nicholas sparks another try i read about of the book and decided it was a waste of my time
i have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote at first sight like me you probably loved all the characters in his previous books he makes every character in this book not loveable ! i kept asking myself who am i rooting for do i care if things go well the best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book could have been a story in itself i miss the old spark
this book was on the bestseller 's shelf at my local bookstore i asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews shocking as a number of other customer 's have commented on this site this book was not worth the money it cost it was silly contrived and unrealistic the cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time i typically do n't read romance novels but i ca n't begin to imagine that that 's possible
i have n't read many books written by patterson but i liked the notebook so i thought i would read some of his other publications i did n't find much to like about at first sight the story is totally unbelievable and the characters it is a boiler plate romance novel the couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart a wave of a wand and they both know they love each other the happy couple then find and overcome adversity patterson is not a bad writer if you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read you wo n't be disappointed if you want a realistic story and believeable characters then at first sight is n't for you
i 've just finished reading boykin 's book beyond the down low '' while i find it well written and his observations often on point i come away from reading the final paragraph thinking so what '' really boykin has unearthed nothing new '' about sexuality or sexual identity as it has been played out since there have been men women and the undecided boykin 's book gains much of its cachet because it is one of the few published books that addresses sexuality from the perspective of a gay black man the very paucity of literature that focuses on the plight of gay black men in america alone makes boykin 's contribution invaluable regardless of the quality of his prose ultimately however his work is forgettable
excellent book on the life of benjamin franklin he certainly was a genius and full of surprizes
take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily the advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong if you want to do really well do what others that are doing well are doing adopt the beliefs mannerisms attitude techniques ideas of who you wish to be like and you 'll get the same results in other words do n't copy john gray
this book did not work for me i believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship in this book the author rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex personally i 'm not looking to 'trick ' anyone into going out with me or fall in love how i open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as i 'm walking around after i 've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game ' properly i do n't feel that it 's a game it 's about being true to ourselves it 's about relating being best friends and we are not peacocks displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time we are empowered with language i 'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as gray does authors that i recommend are charlotte kasl john welwood and john stoltenberg good luck !
hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to he also has a weakness for repeating himself especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our hero '' in his kooky hideaway the central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons who apparently feel emboldened because hiaasen 's south florida is such a completely corrupt place the story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he had n't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends you can do better
the alternate title of this book should have been how to affect an air of sophistication and urbanity in several hundred pages of plodding and frankly unbelievable plotting coupled with two dimensional stereotypes so predictable in their pretentious musings '' an overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors i had hopes for these two having started with cabinet of curiosities '' their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but i retained hope for latent talent then this this conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the i am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of preston and child and perhaps the worst offender of all dan brown
the other reviewers will tell you about the book i 've read most of preston and child 's works including the other two books in this trilogy and they are a good read what gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism i guess it 's a necessity to get published today but you 'd think that at least some male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published i guess most people will sell their souls for money just about all the men in p and l 's books are either wimps effiminate weak bumbling stupid or liars or murderers scared of their own shadows and thoroughly unlikable even pendergast has his moments the women of course are without exception tough brilliant shrewd fearless always right on the rise to the top always outsmarting the men able to knock out a 7 foot 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck forgive the slight hyperbole totally unfeminine and just as unlikeable as the men the stories are very good it 's unfortunate preston and child could n't have come up with better more realisticly human less insulting characters this slop may play in new york and california but in texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women so this is just a warning if you 're a man and those of you who are know what i mean you 'll get sick of the characters in these books
suggest you test your digital capability to download ebooks and open them by using acrobat 's devices '' before buying as acrobat now requires a drm activation on each computer by computer and this apparently has to be transferred one to the other and the worst part is that they apparently have major problems with their drm activation server such that i have been unable to get my instant '' pdf book for two days now there many entries in the adobe forum on this issue the book involved is the balanced scorecard adobe has scored a zero on this one for me the experience is enough to turn one off all future ebooks
for the life of me i ca n't understand how it got the book award it 's a pointless heap of drivel without any appealing characters roth also combines multiple quotes in the same paragraph causing confusion about who 's speaking that plus long rambling confused stntences with no direction make reading it a head pounding chore i quit after reading to the half way point this muddled mess is not worth your time
roth can be an amazing stylist but this book lacks any sense of forward motion and precious little suspense about the past mickey sabbath is obsessed with his dead croatian mistress and with sex in general and the book explores his sexual escapades mostly in the past but some fantasies in present too in microscopic detail this might be acceptable if it was leading to enlightenment or some kind of catharsis but if it 's intended to be there it eluded me when mickey masturbates on her grave for example his release is n't more profound merely because apparently he 's not the only of hers to do so it 's as if portnoy aged but never matured mickey is on the outs with his wife and ruined that relationship partly with a dalliance with a student that came to life when the tape recording the student made of their erotic phone calls finds its way into the university 's hands perhaps this is meant to comment on some of the sexual harassment '' excesses of the nineties but it 's so implausible it does n't wash and seems to be little more than an excuse for a reproduction of that recording printed with a scene of mickey and student mickey is a retired puppetteer and his first wife was his muse she disappeared mysteriously long ago this thought nags at mickey like a scab but it is never resolved for the reader sometimes mickey claims to have murdered her there 's no reason to believe this but there 's no alternative either the book goes on and on episodically mickey throws himself on the mercy of an old friend but is kicked out when he attempts to seduce the wife and also is found sniffing the panties of the daughter whose room he is staying in just because the rants of a dirty old man are described vividly without holding back does n't make them somehow emblematic of the human spirit roth fails to turn these details into something universal and worthwhile it 's a long book that just never catches fire i suspect it won its various awards because the judges did n't know what to make of it and did n't want to be considered prudish there 's no there '' there no story to reflect upon as always there are some lovely passages roth writes vividly and is often funny it would have made a good novella or collection of stories but as a novel it sprawls in its own flab
this novel does n't have a lot of movement sabbath 's theater was a slow pretentious slog his characters were n't particularly nice but contra doestoevsky shakespeare checkov not unusually bad either roth does n't flinch from the nasty side of life he does n't do anything with it either
for a novel that garnished such high praise i expected better i had to work and force myself to finish i never became engaged with the character or the story
although the premise of this book is brilliant perceptive and absolutely vital to the next few years reich sadly presents an incisive example of the economic thinking and progress that made democrats relevant in the it 's years ahead of the bush ideologues who act and think as if the century never happened reich is progressive enough to adopt the policies of the and he does exceptionally well he knows how to blow an eloquent toot '' on the whistle of a charming old steam locomotive like many other politicians of nostalgia he thinks it gives him the right to fly the space shuttle the world is changing as an example can forecast with 5 percent accuracy how many copies of a new video disc it will sell and it has that figure within four hours of the disc going on sale that 's where the brains of is located and it 's why the company needs only clerks for the counter and to stuff the shelves when counters were complicated it made sense to hire clerks now the job involves holding a bar code in front of a laser scanner it has become another job where many companies could use los barratos illegales '' no one has a right '' to a specific job work must be earned by those who acquire the necessary skills fifty years ago it made sense that american auto workers were the best paid in the world their assembly work required skill today truly skilled jobs are done by robots assembly workers do low skill work that is too menial to be automated success today depends on the desire to learn technical and personal skills needed for a specific job sadly too many people have vw bug '' skills and escalade attitudes sorry life is n't like that any more let 's do some numbers there are about 190 million americans in the labour force plus 10 million unemployed at least 10 million illegal aliens have jobs here if reich is right then how can millions of illegal migrants with about a grade 3 formal education get jobs that americans with high school diplomas ca n't hold instead every illegal migrant with a job is another proof that reich is outdated reich completely ignores this issue instead he offers solutions for the future knowledge economy there 's a good business reason why there are millions of illegal migrants in america and why no administration will take action against them reich as a former secretary of labour should address that issue the future is ahead americans deserve a better than going back to the with reich 's liberal allies or back to the with bush 's conservatives of greed cronyism graft and war this book shows reich would have been a great labour secretary for franklin roosevelt but he was merely a seat warmer in the please we 're all going to live in the future so let 's think about the future instead of resurrecting colorful but antiquated policies of the past reich should do much better or else we 'll all be bushwhacked by the sultans of
i purchased the book on jul 23 and the delivery date is 14 to 24. now one month has past since i purchased the book but i did not get the book yet ! ! i really want to know what is going on with my book !
i picked up this book because i thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids they enjoyed the animal farm '' a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals but i guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer this ones almost downright depressing plus theres sex ! good thing i read ahead a little bit or i would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure i guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80 's but it wont fly in 2006 i tell you what why is there no option for zero stars ! oh well one star for you then orwell
first of all consider the question that lewis is trying to ask what went wrong with the 'middle east ' and their 'failure ' to modernize and now think about how big this book is about 150 pages the 'middle east ' is a huge area extending from morocco to iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure ' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the ottoman empire that is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'middle east ' as 'islam ' as though islam is homogenous or even centered in the ottoman empire granted the sultan of the ottoman empire was also the caliph but the twelver shi'is do n't consider him to be legitimate anyway to consider islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'west ' is reprehensible consider now the fact that the majority of muslims do n't even live in the middle east or the ottoman empire how can lewis truthfully use the term 'islam ' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong ' when the area he 's speaking about does n't even constitute the majority of muslims in the world ! this book is a quick read for people who are n't in the field to think that they 're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'middle east ' the worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who would n't normally read it anyway this is a dangerous book because the name bernard lewis is synonymous with expert in middle east affairs this was a lazy half hearted attempt to cash in on people 's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people 's minds bad lewis very very bad any 'liberal historian ' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it if you want better sources look to john esposito albert hourani and nikki keddie all of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of bernard lewis check them out
in the post world in which this book subtitled the clash between islam and modernity in the middle east '' was published it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day this however is not to be found in what went wrong instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae we learn for instance that a distinguishing characteristic of western music is polyphony by harmony or counterpoint this begins in its simplest form with the choir in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect then comes the keyboard instrument matching the ten fingers of the two hands following different routes in a common purpose and finally the musical ensemble from duets and trios to the full orchestra '' while this is all well and good and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of the clash between islam and modernity '' that has led to the precarious times in which we live or on another note harmony counterpoint we learn that robinson crusoe was translated into arabic by butrus and published in the late 1850 's big deal ! what we do n't learn anything about is the rise of militant islamism there is no mention of wahhabism or how this fundamentalist islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity the muslim brotherhood also is not to be found in the index nor is there a mention of sayyid qutb or his writing of the incendiary manifesto milestones furthermore there is not a single reference to though usama bin laden does appear albeit seemingly as an afterthought in what appears to be a hastily added afterword so what went wrong beats
i bought this book on a recommendation from a friend but after reading this book i 'm frankly not sure the friend read this book i was really looking for a thoughtful answer to the question in the title but i now suspect the title is a gimmick to sell more books in a september 11 world this book is actually based on three lecture series by the author and at the end a quick chapter titled conclusion '' does not reach a conclusion and does not answer the title question my guess on what went wrong corrupt leadership more interested in enriching themselves rather than transparent the indonesians have a term for this kkn for corruption collusion and nepotism i would give this zero stars if possible but there are some interesting historical tidbits that might warrant 1 star
luckily this book is only 160 pages so i did n't waste too much time it merely says islamic countries used to be and now they 're pretty backward very few examples of why and how this happened i thought it was going to be a history of islam but it 's more a history of islamic nations it 's sketchy it 's theoretical and there 's little filled in the middle of the ideas it 'll say things like modernity came from christendom during the and centuries and changed the very way life was lived in islamic countries '' then it gives no examples of what it means by that i applaud people who want to learn about islam but i recommend they buy a different book than this one
after reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about very close minded and not open to any changes at the end you will be like whatever
i cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think if the book were about say sex maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex the book is all about attitude and setting might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do it '' the book is an infomercial about thinking like the one 's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do it '' the infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes like this book and that 's okay because maxwell uses good material much of what maxwell asserts i agree with amen ! candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood plus proximity you need to be there ! but no where does maxwell instruct you how to score how to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc etc to eureka ! '' but in fairness to maxwell i dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize i dont believe thinking and emotions etc are that i mean some very creative people swear by drugs and booze
a mediocre intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure but it sorely lacks depth committment to its subject or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity
rachel and her children '' is an compilation of the author 's conversations with homeless people highlighting how the downtrodden suffer in the united states at the end of the century jonathan kozol pulls no punches in his indictment of the american way putting the blame for homelessness squarely on the shoulders of everyone else americans with homes that is the rest of us although much of what kozol depicts is i would have welcomed a more balanced presentation of the homeless issue not only discussing the shortcomings of a political and economic system that makes it difficult for the homeless to overcome their situation but also indicating that the homeless bear a good deal of personal repsonsibility in their plight making little to no effort to seek employment avoiding or sometimes even refusing to accept the albeit limited help offered by government agencies sinking further into poverty by irresponsibly having children whom they can not afford to support etc for those of you who want a stronger kick in the pants about the suffering of the poor than that provided by jonathan kozol i suggest reading the essay of another jonathan swift 's a modest proposal ''
dear sean thanks for sending me your book deliver us from evil defeating terrorism despotism and liberalism '' before i put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep i just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me let me get this straight you 'd like to see all liberals vanish from the face of the american political system and have only conservative republicans running the show is that right hmm let me see if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system there was the soviet union fascist italy nazi germany those are three just off the top of my head they did n't like liberalism either well sean i got to get going i 'm sure i 'll write again soon all my best bill ps remember fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced

i just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece 's meeting with sean but first the review in order not to diminish the previous reviews i will just focus on the whole war talk on page 4 no messing around here sean states w e must take the war to them rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood '' wow bring it on dude oh you mean let 's send somebody else 's kid to fight right on page 247 he drills that point in with i 'd like to see the good governor dean present a case that there 's any higher moral cause than defending one 's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack '' if it 's such a great moral cause '' sean why oh why ai n't you out there with the rest of my family does this by the way mean you are immoral since you punked out i never thought of myself as moral '' just because i volunteered and served as a paratrooper in vietnam is military service only for democrats and brown people should we have a new draft catagory such as '' for republican '' which means you do n't have to serve to paraphrase frank purdue it takes a tender man to spout tough talk page 108 puts down democrats i 'm a democrat who served in vietnam or am i repeating myself with w hen it comes to the hitlers the brezhnevs the saddams pussyfooting is the order of the day '' yeah sean tell me what you really think well sean some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you do and was n't the bush family in business with hitler during wwii here is really why this guy is full of himself my niece visiting me before heading to the gulf and her first combat tour spotted him in dc she introduced herself and told him she was a fan when she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book saying he would ship it to her she is very polite and told him he did n't have to sean insisted she wrote her address down before heading overseas i asked her if sean had sent the book as promised no and no surprise for me so me being me i contacted sean by email twice but got not reply too busy impressing all those other servicewomen i guess sean hannity not just by this book but by his actions is a coward blowhard and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen his book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book you should be ashamed of yourself sean but that would mean taking a moral '' position would n't it

richard is a funny guy he never can overcome his scientism and naturalistic reductionism i wish i could talk to him to help him out if i were doctor he needs 1 therapy and 2 to think a little more dawkins like to use arguments and does not know anything about christian theology i 'm truly sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about when talks about religious matters or even science i have also read his article science is not a religion '' which is not very good article and apparently for him science is a religion usually religious experience involve a awareness of the transcendent and b total commitment to it dawkins ' transcendant is the great scientism '' SMILE and of course he is commited to it not the science but scientism otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism
if you want to read a classic of western mythology look no further this is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth ' about reality the tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers ' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality and when evolutionary 'science ' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy ' this view will come out false this could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong let alone realize something is wrong with it what almost everyone does n't seem to understand even about valid arguments is this all a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false if the conclusion is outrageous you do n't bite the bullet '' swallow the medicine '' and accept the conclusion anyway you say there must be something wrong with the premises even if you ca n't point out where the mistake is it took some years before someone came up with a solution to why zeno 's argument that 'nothing moves ' is incorrect but during that period of time no one except maybe a few fools here and probably 'intellectuals ' like this dawkins character accepted the conclusion that nothing moves
this has n't improved much from previous editions and is still as bad as they come ever hear of the composer grofe grand canyon suite mississippi suite well you wo n't find him reviewed here how about gloria coates surely they must cover peter maxwell davies the renown english composer nope ! william bolcom kamra ince henri lazarof bo linde george mckay mieczyslaw vainberg morton feldman none of these either and the section on charles ives ernest bloch and many others is pathetically small the orchestral masterpiece scheherazade gets several recommendations compared with over 40 in the third ear the examples of this books failings go on and on i could go on but i 'm getting tired of typing and i 've embarrassed them enough so i 'll stop in summary this book addresses the standard stuff that most everyone knows already check schnabel out for good mono recordings of the beethoven sonatas gieseking did a great job on debussy works in the 50 's but the sound is not good by today 's standards etc not a good shopping guide way too many gaps and you 'll miss the good stuff if you use it worse it 's misleading oh and did i mention the chubby design of the book itself the book has a lot of pages because of the small page dimensions the third ear by comparison has 25 larger pages with almost as many pages same sized print the gramophone guide wo n't stay open and looks fat but really is skinny on recommendations and educational value finally to my title for this review the gramophone guide and the penguin guide sometimes say almost the exact same thing i will cite just one example here but i 've run into others read the review of dg 's remastered release of wilhelm kempff 's 50 's cycle of the beethoven piano sonatas in both the penguin and gramophone guides i quote those who have cherished kempff 's later stereo style for it 's magical spontaneity will find this conveyed more intensively in his mono set recorded between 1951 and 1956 '' with the exception of one word and the addition of an adjective the same sentence appears in both books so there 's no doubt that these people read each other 's books and copy choice sentences and perhaps do n't even listen actually to all of the music that they 're reviewing so who 's copying from whom maybe it goes both ways or maybe just one way it 's impossible to tell but with all of the other faults that this book has i would n't pay the postage to have it shipped to me if it were free it may be worthwhile checking the gramophone out of a library for occasional reference or to read an essay but if you want a book worthy of purchase get the third ear it 's not perfect but much better written honest and it covers almost every composer that you 've ever heard of
this was a very creative fun book very funny but i mean how many pages can you read of it was great the two hundred pages and then it got repetitive yes it is well written and i really felt like i was reading from real people but nearly 400 pages of this no eventually i gave up through 220 pages or so this would have been a really great or parts of the book but the whole thing that was too much read if your daring or for something different just want to let you know
in iron john '' robert bly announces that american men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness he illustrates his point with one of the brothers grimm 's more obscure and frankly less interesting stories interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point he also draws heavily on freudian and jungian theories he proves his point in the same way freud and jung proved theirs ' by saying this is what i see i am the expert so that makes it true occham 's razor be darned '' bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or heaven forbid that his observations might be wrong for example bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion despite his objective tone bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true he does not consider that by age 35 most men have realized that they do n't really want to be firemen could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to such as books naw it 's got ta be that dreams '' thing bly also describes a case where students during the viet nam war broke into their college presidents ' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the cia bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures because their fathers left home to work preventing their sons from seeing how men work bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger no there had to be a real '' reason for the and are n't we lucky to have robert bly to tell us what it is along the way bly overloads his writing with literary references all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes it 's all very pretentious er uh interesting but so what i could interpret the same passages to mean something else if i lived at the time the passages were written my interpretation would most likely be very different despite bly 's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal bly ' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down however it underscores what is wrong with his whole premise he tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact but uses only subjective views many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context to support the idea sorry bob you ca n't have it both ways one gets the impression that iron john '' was cynically written to fill a niche like all books iron john '' targets a specific audience tells them they are not happy and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy bly 's target audience is white men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements if you do not need a political movement to define who you are then iron john '' is not for you
this book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to modern man '' the author assumes modern men are broken '' and therefore must somehow be fixed '' and he offers his advice on how to go about being a real man '' therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men the same men who buy hummers guns beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood real or perceived the author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles while this is true for some boys and men it is by no means a universal trait any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is he will also find this book insulting and absurd mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing however a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself the danger of mentoring is that of the alpha male '' mentality taking over and running a boy 's or young man 's life to his detriment when that occurs cultist mentality takes over a good and frightening example of this is robert bly himself taken too far this mentality leads to horrors such as the people 's temple jim jones and his mass heaven 's gate scientology and a numberless other dangerous for those boys and men who feel they need such advice a far superior book is fire in the belly '' by sam keen it does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that iron john '' does and it is far better as well as written
as ridiculous as i found this book upon reading reviews from so many men who loved it i am filled with horror granted i am a female college student so i completely missed the boat but i cross my fingers and wish like crazy that not all men have this sort of deep psychological complex i find hope in a few reviews written by men who are still confident that they can be men without a self help book everything that can be said about bly 's methods has been said he is not a psychologist he is not a folklorist he is a poet that 's what the two stars are for folklore is dynamic and to suppose the iron john '' folktale is the same today as it was before the grimms collected it is purely blind the grimms slashed and edited and put in cute morals if you think the granny they collected it from would have told the exact same iron john '' tale as the woman two houses away or ten years earlier or two days later you are a stranger to folklore society holds on to the tales that mean something to us is n't it curious then that iron john '' dropped from our stock of folktales until ressurrected by bly who suddenly claims it is a reflection of modern america
i have a university maths degree and found the book very obvious and drawn out for the first few chapters in spite of this i looked forward to what was going to be explained later suddenly from a very simple and easy to understand explanation on the emh he starts to use mathematics in his equations that i had a lot of difficulty following there was very little or no explanation of how these equations were arrived at and a lot of mathematics and statisics is assumed this book does not apply the theory in ny meaningful way to the markets let alone the capital markets in my opinion i found that i took very little away from this book and would not recommend it to anyone who has basic mathematics like myself or is looking for some deeper insight into the markets i would hate to have mr peters as a teacher based on his book
the good first there is a lot of good i enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal my husband and i have a great marriage he knows i have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me he is certainly not ever wanting more sex just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes in jest i 'm sure i say that to show that not coming from a prude the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it 's normal i am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice it was dealt with like it 's a fact so get used to it your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night the men give accounts of this like oh well does n't mean i do n't love my wife in my opinion just they are n't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts does n't mean it 's i found the book to be very very discouraging that a bunch of married christian men would unapologetically key word here see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less we 're not talking lingerie here and think about what she 's like in bed or what her nipples look like there 's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart or maybe they should not do this it really threw me for a loop ! i guess i did n't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are not that i think they do n't want a lot of it but i found it discouraging for christian wives to think that their husbands ca n't go to work without picturing everyone naked i found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it 's normal '' and women just need to get used to the idea
the stuff in this book might be true but that does n't mean i 'm going to change my life just to please some man i always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that or go find another woman end of story
unfortunately this book is only going to help you if you 're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who 's let herself go for the modern woman with common sense and who does n't have her man beg her for sex for instance this book is completely useless i can think of a few women who 'd benefit from it church ladies but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman i also found shaunti feldhahn 's way of writing very anoying at the beggining of the book it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever i get it respect the man there 's no need to say it 30 times with different words it was definitly a waste of money
save your time money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous predictable stone barrington novel the short forever '' wow this one stinks like others i put up with the shallow characters ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance and come to think of it who gives a damn i do n't what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character save for isabel the maid felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb vacuous and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic ! the only normal female character who spared stone mary ann unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought
this book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential it virtually invented the prose style that signifies boredom and alienation and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of rage against the machine 's evil empire '' but it is n't very good the dimestore existentialism aged badly didion 's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile the same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times often in superior forms that what was innovative in the seventies does n't really cut it anymore not that it was very original in its time coming as it did after thirty years of sartre and ten of antonioni not to mention horace mccoy 's terrific 1935 novel they shoot horses do n't they '' popularized in a hollywood film coincidentally only a year before play it '' 's publication a minor footnote to a trend
i agree wholeheartedly with kenneth ryan 's review this book was recommended '' reading in one of my english classes at ucla several years ago and i bought it but just now picked it up for a read the problem is that the main character is so vapid that i simply did not care what happened to her it has always been my firm belief that one must identify with care about or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading this novel was painful to finish who cares what happens to these people i agree that whatever splash '' the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters it 's hard to shock us these days and the book is now just plain uninteresting
the title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention when the book arrived i was eager to read it i cracked the pages and my jaw dropped not in a good way this book is so poorly written i am baffled at how it ever got published in the first place i read as much as i could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible i returned to amazon to look at the reviews again this time rather than just taking the star rating and featured reviews '' at face value i really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews it appears that many many kids have been assigned to write a review here at amazon as part of a class project if you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children 95 of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating if you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book if you 're between the ages of 11 and 13 you apparently will love this book if you are an adult who knows better do n't expect much from it in my opinion it is a waste of paper on a side note a little time investigating the author brings into speculation about the veracity of his story
the book started out fairly well but the amateurish writing really did start to get to me after awhile the murders the story hinges around get dull and tiresome and i actually began rooting for the unidentified killer to do away with kate paine the undeveloped and boring heroine of the book when finally learned who the culprit was i had totally lost interest and felt that the author just pulled it out of a hat without any reason or logic and there is nothing more annoying in books than the killer explaining to the victim who is tied up and forced to listen to the obligatory rantings all the reasons he has done such terrible deeds for a better story read the firm '' by john grisham or the job '' by douglas kennedy
i was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books i felt let down and like i had waisted my time and money on the entire series
how disapointing after more than 20 years of reading to have it all end in this fashion typical of steven king i was hoping he would give this story his best effort but instead it seems he just wanted to be done with it as a long time king fan i hate to diss this book but can not give high marks for this one inserting himself into the story lost all credibility for me i wish i had stopped reading the series at book 4 or 5 as my imagination created several ending senarios that were better than the actual
i was extremely disappointed with this book the author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter in my opinion not worth the money
this book goes on my list of the worst books i have ever read it took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction i had to read it for my ap us history class and sure it was very educational i have a test on it tomorrow so let 's see how much i retained it just took forever ! i spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful smokey mountains those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included i read all day every day and it bored me to death i constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days i liked the last chapter because it was the last
if you 're thinking of reading this book let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy really and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners but this book in perfectly plain english sucked there is no plot no beginning middle or end and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it
after quite a while i finally put the time into reading this book and i am totally ambivalent whether i should have or not i do not think that one should pay too much attention to those readers who do not take their history seriously to those that want to propound a certain ideological agenda something i am realising has been and is a depressing fact of american socialisation those people of the ideological left will love this book and the those of the ideological right will hate it that is a given my question is this what does zinn have to say for the historian for the thinking and well considered historian the person who well distilled in classic debates of history and the role of people power and groups classes in the grand scheme of things what does zinn have to say for those who were raised with a university education where the primary goal was to display an adequate overview of all major acceptable views and to show a mature understanding of those views '' not to argue just one side american historiography has a broad tendency to degenerate into opposite truth camps of the right and left mindlessly shouting out statistics citing dates supporting and dashing administrations to try to make a point the entire pursuit of knowledge has been subverted by a kind of default to crude rhetoric for rhetoric 's sake see any american news programme or most columnists and purile debate other countries and cultures shake their heads at such perversion of the whole idea of the way americans understand history so do historians such as zinn add to this atrophy of the brain or do they ammeliorate it i am not so sure i know the answer i am thinking that his whole style may betray an answer zinn 's radical '' style is deliberately unbalanced he makes no apologies for this it is an attempt to right the largely unbalanced scales of history written by dominant elites those who have and hold the power this is a worthy ideal but i am not so sure that a descriptive litany of abuse by those with power really says that much about an accurate interpretation of history and if it does not then what are people actually taking away from this book anyone who reads history and i mean people who read a lot of history will find zinn to be more than just unbalanced they will find him to be simplistic i was caught up in his light drama he writes well in the same way as one reads a comic book and then it dawned upon me zinn like a version of fox news reporting writes as if history were a comic book all evil on one side and all deprived and down trodden masses on by the other for the considerate person looking for a higher understanding there will be an amazing sense of dissatisfaction a feeling of being swindled if one is trying to achieve social justice there is a feeling of being swindled that may not be flattering for zinn but i got the distinct feeling that one was dealing with a in the area of history some of his research is hard to check he does not cite pages and i sometimes wonder if he ever cracked an economic history textbook he certainly would not be considered up there with the grand old man hobsbawm who is truly an intellectual joy to read and a leftist with common sense ! ! or lukas another leftist in his great big trouble a study of class in america '' zinn does not even rate compared with these historians so the question i return to is this for the considerate person of history what does one get from this read my conclusion is that besides some interesting vignettes on american inhumanity to man or american inhumanity to american not much even if american history is imbalanced because the majority '' or mainstream history does not pay heed to the downtrodden meeting diatribe with diatribe is neither a worthy nor reasonable approach moreover it is intellectually dishonest being biased for whatever reason is not something that historians scientists or social theoritst should try to be historians must try to grasp a modicum of understanding through the haze of sources and alternative viewpoints they must neither be hoodwinked by the codswallop of postmodernism or the absolute truth certainty '' of various historians that is the challenge for the historian indeed it is the challenge for any thinking human being if one wants to write comics that is a worthy endevour it is not however history for a man of his age he should know better ! you are thinking of reading this i would say that his writing style and capturing the drama is rather good despite the fact that his sources from the little i was able to check are horrible
i 'll put my opinion first so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character '' people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you how well can you predict what people in your own country will do would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as barzini i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the inside view '' the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history patterns religion family the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family the state italian modes of achieving success the split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were and interesting but his portrayal of italian character '' is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you
i did not have great '' expectations after reading some of dickens other work see my review of tale of the two cities '' but someone told me they at least made a movie about this one so i figured i may as well give it a shot well lets just say that i wont be seeing the movie but i will admit that this one is at least better then the other book because it is just thick enough to balance out this wobbly dresser i have when i weged it under one of the legs a better effort ! i give you a generous two stars this time charlie ! youre getting there so keep trying
which ones the movie with the naked blond chick on the cover
senator obama is an engaging speaker and has potential to be a leader but this book does n't offer any new insights or solutions to the political climate we have today in the usa nicely written but the next book will tell whether he can avoid the decline into standard partisan behavior now that the dems are in charge of congress time will tell
first and foremost do your job as a senator stop the book tour doing self promotion how is the real estate issue going please explain ! !
senator obama'a latest screed is a book about politics common gound and reclaiming the american dream people looking for some deep thought that transcends our political social and foriegn policy issues are bound to be disapointed especially if you are a progressive who swooned over his speech at the democratic convention 2 years ago the book breaks down into his childhood in hawaii youthful indiscertions a little coke herb and the transition into the man he is today obama 's centrism is really putting to someone like me who feels that partisonship is a good idea at least your enemies know where you stand he would rather work the middle ground and find soloutions to our problems that are at it 's heart does not lend itself to a 'gray area ' the chapter i found on race is typical clinton doublespeak as an american his appeal to 'universality ' is trite at best because in one minute he knows he does not live an authentic '' cultural black expericence obama who is mixed is doing what shelby steele calls racial negotitating making whites feel comfortable around someone like obama who trusts that white america will do the right thing and he believes in the moral goodness of the majority white population and this country 's ethos thereby he is liked for not challenging their morality obama tries to have it both ways empathizing with the american and hispanic struggle the vote he really needs to win election if he chooses to run for the presidency and he unlike many black intellectuals knows that the conservative movement used the symbols of the great society progress to butress their arguments in a racial cold war '' obama fails when he lectures latinos on immirgration and by trying to find common ground he ends up alienating those who challenge this society 's attitude about both blacks and think he is naive about race in this country i for one do not trust the majority society to treat us with brotherhood and charity after 389 years americans ought to know better i look at people as enemies or allies and white conservatives are the enemy of americans or do we have to go to new orleans for the genocide i see dead black people floating they attempted last obama wants to negoitate with conservatives and find common ground that 's his right i would rather have power because it is the only thing white conservatives and their minority allies understand the last chapter he talks of his wife and her family that is the most touching thing in the whole book his love for her seems genuine and you can tell he has empathy and concern for her and children in general i feel that his book is just and average at best maybe he might be president but he will not be the 'first black president ' but if you are a believer in obama 's charisma and think he can rise above petty politics and bring people of different races into a common american ideal then this book is for you but if you do not like colorblind centrists '' like obama and harold ford think they are weak 'uncle toms '' then this book will to you be just average
i wish sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels that flow and voice i understood so well at first sight felt like i was reading a deadline novel just words no insight did n't make this reader think at all sorry just the way i read it
i gagged my way through the notebook but thought i would give nicholas sparks another try i read about of the book and decided it was a waste of my time
i have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote at first sight like me you probably loved all the characters in his previous books he makes every character in this book not loveable ! i kept asking myself who am i rooting for do i care if things go well the best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book could have been a story in itself i miss the old spark
this book was on the bestseller 's shelf at my local bookstore i asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews shocking as a number of other customer 's have commented on this site this book was not worth the money it cost it was silly contrived and unrealistic the cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time i typically do n't read romance novels but i ca n't begin to imagine that that 's possible
i have n't read many books written by patterson but i liked the notebook so i thought i would read some of his other publications i did n't find much to like about at first sight the story is totally unbelievable and the characters it is a boiler plate romance novel the couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart a wave of a wand and they both know they love each other the happy couple then find and overcome adversity patterson is not a bad writer if you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read you wo n't be disappointed if you want a realistic story and believeable characters then at first sight is n't for you
i have very mixed feelings about this book and ca n't say i enjoyed it all that much i love the story of sappho what little is known of it and so i picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism research and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of lesbos but monsters centaurs i mean the story of sappho 's life is not the story of the odyssey and for the life of me i do n't understand why author erica jong decided to give her readers a combination of greek heroine and clash of the titans once i was able to get past the fantasy elements i realized that i was not being pulled into the story on its own merits there was n't enough emotional dimension for all her travels we 're shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we do n't see enough of a real character i read sappho 's poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is not present in this book i 'm not saying the book is without its good points jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious but i found the whole bit a little odd like picking up a book about cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons unicorns and the goddess isis if jong had written about ariadne this all might have worked the blend of fantasy just did n't add up to a palatable meal for me
have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished that 's the way sappho 's leap was for me i finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing i had n't spent good money even bad money any money on it admittedly very little is known about the only ancient greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry her words are searing lovely and sometimes erotic but erica jong 's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll sappho as her heroine is not only uninteresting but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her sure she experiences heartache and longing but jong simply fails to give me a reason to care jong just tells me flatly in first person how sappho feels and what she thinks but does n't make it real for me she tries to make sappho into a female odysseus and ca n't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a historical account and all that wrapped up with a very disappointing hollywood ending tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage i ca n't believe erica jong has actually written and published eight novels it honestly seems like she wrote sappho 's leap specifically to sell to high school english departments to teach a bit of greek history with a feminist slant regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit sappho 's leap is utter tripe
on our recent road trip my girlfriend and i brought along some audio books to help us stay awake both were historical fiction set in ancient greece sappho 's leap was read by the author and her mangled pronunciations and tone may have influenced my reaction but i do n't think so unlike thermopylae the subject of gates of fire review coming soon virtually nothing about sappho is known jong was free to make up just about any story she liked and she did sappho 's leap is a sappy love story with a long interlude where jong basically plagiarizes homer only watering him down to speed the plot further and to make matters worse sappho 's leap is not very it is melodramatic banal and overly adjectival it reads like syrup jong apparently ca n't think of a word for vagina other than delta '' and nothing for penis other than phallus '' which words are like comedy catchphrases by the end of the novel the book starts out well sappho has climbed a cliff but pauses to reflect on the story of her life in media res like every greek story she starts at the beginning relating how she runs away from hom with alceous a famous lesbian singer they are exiled from lesbos for trying to overthrow its tyrant and her adventures begin she is married off to a paunchy lush who lives in syracuse although pregnant with alceous 's child to be named cleis mispronounced by jong when her husband dies the adventure begins in earnest after a stay in egypt sappho takes off with the fabulist aesop for delphi but is frequently sidetracked along the way jong sends sappho to the amazons on crete ! where she causes the return of pegasus the island of the centaurs the underworld medusa 's sister etc in an age where the greeks occupied the majority of the mediterranean sappho manages to elude everyone for a space of ten years or more which occupy maybe four chapters of the book these adventures are trite simplified copies of the odyssey and add almost nothing to the plot nothing really improves from there once sappho returns to the land of the real jong wraps things up quickly and predictably the novel ends with a syrupy happy ending sappho and all her lovers and friends end up living on another random island with her friends until her daughter sails up with her grandchildren ugh and do n't get me started on the poems '' at the end this was my first erica jong book and i think it will be my last it gets two stars only because i need a lower rung for truly pulp romance which this book just barely isn't
that 's what this book should have been titled erica jong is indeed an incredible writer but not here not even close her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer i seriously doubt that sappho wherever she may now be finds it entertaining or edifying to know that erica jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan if sex and the city '' were still spewing out new episodes perhaps jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring sappho as a dildo salesperson and carrie bradshaw as her devoted customer feminism is not about having to use scary '' words like dildo and to prove how much of a woman you are it 's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone ever
i previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of house of leaves but after some thought have decided to edit it house of leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read one individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and could n't put it down now i love a good horror story and several people promised me that this was the horror story to read after suffering through long boring descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist i failed to find the scary i looked and looked but it just was n't there thus i 'm disappointed it is n't so much that i minded slogging through faux academic literature although that in itself is annoying how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project ! but that i slogged through it looking for something that for me at least just was n't there so if you want my opinion the book is n't scary and it 's rather long and dry even the supposedly frightening experiences of johnny truant the tattoo artist were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over hence my previous title of a handful of ritalin and a pot of coffee could n't make this readable '' do i really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses i only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement that 's what it felt like
castro et al are to cuban history what comrade stalin and company were to russian history and joseph goebbels and friends were to german history the title by itself is laughable who except for castro cultists really thinks that the military could not have beaten castro 's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so as it was the defeat of a force of less than 1500 cuban exiles left stranded by the on cuban soil is really a testament to president kennedy 's poor judgement rather than to communist cuba 's military prowess for a truly balanced historical account of the bay of pigs affair read peter wyden 's bay of pigs the untold story '' then for a study in propagandizing and read this book
rather than a concise history of the middle east this book offers only 146 pages of brief summary of outside powers effects on the region this is n't a history of the middle east it 's a history of how europe the us and the soviet union interacted with the middle east though undeniably important in understanding the region western and eastern relations with the middle east are not the only reasons for studying it there is more going on far more that shlaim does not address and it opens a large crediblility gap what is missing a lot this might be a good book if it 's only goal were to teach people a very concise history of western and eastern relations to the middle east so perhaps it is just poorly titled the information that it did offer though seemed good enough and it provided a fair overview of us relations with the middle east but i expected more and was dissapointed
daniel pipes said about this book '' with uncommon skill shlaim has the confines of a very small volume with very large pack misjudgments arrogance and lack of sense into 1994 's worst book on the middle east '' well is that true probably but just to show everyone that i am not only tolerant and but generous i 'll give this book not just one but two stars ! you see there are plenty of facts in this small book in addition to the misjudgments arrogance and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with shlaim claims that the 1973 yom kippur war broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace he 's not the only one to have said this but i would n't consider saying something like this on a dare i 'd be laughed out of town ! could i say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor no and just how strong is the peace between egypt and israel anyway not very it is more a than a peace with a constant barrage of propaganda from the egyptian side after that we see shlaim explain that israel can have territory or peace really i think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land in my opinion israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other and the author says that israel can have territory or american support again this could well be a false choice even if israel for some reason can not have both american support and territory why ought one expect it to have american support if it does not have territory shlaim sums up the problem of the arabs versus the jews security pleases the jews fairness pleases the arabs i wish this were true let 's see fairness does that mean letting everyone including jews and arabs buy land throughout the region and keep it does that mean a truth and reconciliation session or two where the arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against levantine jews sounds fair to me ! shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal jewish land or that it is unfair to allow israel to stay on the map as for the oslo peace accords shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era plenty of people were extremely suspicious of oslo shlaim was wrong here and those who were suspicious of oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious i think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of shlaim now what does shlaim recommend it is simple america is simply too much in favor of israel ! shlaim thinks we need a more '' approach and that this was written before america ought not bolster israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary islamic threat '' wow imaginary but unbeatable shlaim really took a strong view here i think showed that we 're dealing with a real not an imaginary threat and in the long run why should n't a war in favor of truth justice and human rights be winnable i see no reason to give up without even trying if you want to learn about war and peace in the middle east try some other book
this being the first book i read by danielle steel i expected more than what i got since i love the moive verisons of her book the start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and i like alittle unpredicatable stuff
i have listened to and enjoyed many books on cd in the past few years this reader is among the worst that i 've had the displeasure of hearing the content of this book is great so do n't get me wrong however the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended he pronounces many character names incorrectly including carpathia and adbullah his character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive annoying especially carpathia 's his voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue he also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason these are just the most obvious and annoying problems there are too many to list completely here so please trust me and avoid listening to this book
i dragged myself through every novel in this series with like compulsion always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our lord therefore i anticipated this final novel to be glorious as the title indicates but i was woefully wrong are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming king and his kingdom certainly not ! i support christian fiction with many 5 star reviews just look at my other reviews but i can not recommend this series
my kids started reading the left behind kids books and because i was concerned about the message and theology of the books i started reading them also then i decided to check out the adult '' books from the library i am a pentacostal believer in jesus christ and parts of the theology are not what i read in the bible i can stil enjoy a good book one with interesting characters realistic dialogue and a good plot the issue of plot is difficult for the left behind books i admit because we know who wins if we 've read the end of the new testament as to the rest it fell flat most of the dialogue did n't ring true after a few of the books i was interested in some of the characters but by the end of the books there were only a few of the original characters left and they were some of the least interesting to begin with how many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in revelation how many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in book 1 there is nothing new and interesting in this book the last book is just boring it would have been nice at the end of the book to wrap up everything jesus comes back and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over right some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all it was an incredible let down i felt like i had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over nothing we stick with that one main guy and everyone else is left in the dust it should have had a really really happy ending but even that was boring if i had my time back i would stick to the kid versions if only to discuss theological issues with my children at least in the kid books the sermons are shorter and i will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series
tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts '' or scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period '' series see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items
our family has greatly enjoyed the scholastic children 's dictionary so it made sense to also get the scholastic children 's thesaurus what a disappointment ! nearly every word my fourth grader looks up for school work is not in this book it is pretty much useless for her school work do n't bother with it
my child is in grade and must look up synonyms very few of the words on her lists are in this book this is not a helpful book at all i guess i should buy an adult thesaurus for grade
david shenk 's new book the immortal game '' is a nostalgic journey through the history of chess and indeed the influence of chess on history in the context of searching his own chess past shenk provides a rich collection of chess facts and anecdotes this is all tied together as the author reviews the remarkable chess game between anderssen and kierseritzky the book does present some interesting material however i can not recommend the book the book was just too simplistic and geared for an audience that has only limited exposure to chess for comparison try searching for bobby fischer '' by fred waitzkin
cute dog obnoxius owners ok i am one of the few that did not enjoy the book let alone finish it my hopes were to pass it on to nephew wife i did not care for let alone expect a description of the couples sex habits birth control strategy mix that in with a smattering of needless cursing and no one gets this book it is heading back to the used book store where i got it
as a dog lover and past owner of two dogs who will remain in my heart forever i was disappointed marley would try the patience of a saint instead of being entertaining the story struck me with sheer frustration marty wurtz author of deceptions and betrayal
i wish i had heeded amberlis 's '' review this is no more than a long essay describing various french women in history and some attitudes of modern french women the historical references are interesting but several are repeated some more than once in different chapters of the book and the last chapter quoting at length from henry viii 's diaries regarding his amorous adventures with a french woman seems to have been thrown in to make the book seem longer and more titillating the most annoying feature is the large number of typographical and grammatical errors for example chaise lounge '' instead of chaise longue '' i would have enjoyed reading a condensed and better edited version in the new yorker but i really regret having paid 10.00 for the book
not as good as entre nous '' less fun and more acedemic but even then it is not a well written essay the few good salient points are repeated too often and with not much creativity or development
having traveled studied worked and dated in france over the last 15 years i have become fascinated by the sometimes vast cultural differences that separate american and french women which was why i was so excited to read '' however this book falls far short of its goal to explain the mystique of the french woman disappointinly this book is clearly written from an outsider 's point of view as if the research were done by surfing the internet for other francophile sites and visiting the card catalog of the local library it is a view of the french female psyche that is 3 times removed from reality and is merely a perpetuation of every stereotype ever put forth about their allure without the sociological explanation and background that would actually make this a worthwhile read there is very little new or groundbreaking in this book much better are polly platt 's french or foe '' or even the now famous le divorce '' by diane johnson and if you purchased this book to bring a little of the french mystique '' into your life you would be much better buying a copy of cosmopolitan and a round trip ticket to paris
i did n't read the passage that the other reviewer did who stated did you know that if you start a business from your home everything you currently own and use for the corporation tables computers chairs etc can be considered a donation to the corporation resulting in a write off on your individual tax return you can even write off your rent if you operate from there ! '' but assuming his citation of the book is accurate the book is flat wrong a contribution by a shareholder to a corporation in a 26 usc 351 transaction is not a charitable contribution and is not deductible by the contributing shareholder moreover one can not contribute assets to a corporation in exchange for stock and then cause the corporation to make a 26 usc 179 election with respect to the contributed assets merely operating a business inside corporate solution is not a silver bullet for tax savings nor as some will claim is forming a nv corporation
i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several run on sentences with no punctuation i was determined to try though once i got used to the almost editing i was able to enjoy the story it is a challenge but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life i 'm not sure the effort was worth it though note to writers employ editors so that your story is n't lost due to hard to read prose ! it added nothing to the book to create a new style '' and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead
frustrated authors take note you can be published and you do n't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation sentence clarity story structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses '' had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher who was either drunk or high or both who thought what the hell let 's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i 'm sure people will buy it after all americans do n't care about grammar anyway '' i 'm not going to dive into the plot of the you can read it above this book falls short of one of the best in literature how they compare this guy to faulkner is beyond me the comparrison is an insult to faulkner and people who read books in general most fifth graders can write better more enthralling naratives
i have enjoyed many of anne tyler 's books particularly dinner at the homesick restaurant '' breathing lessons '' and back when we were grownups '' saint maybe '' was a huge disappointment the plot and characters were mediocre at best and a bizarre religion the church of the second chance played a major part in the story by the end of the book it had completely taken over the church of the second chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult yes ian bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life but why the book was named saint maybe '' is still a mystery to me one of the children in ian 's care made reference to ian as perhaps being saint maybe '' but who the heck is saint maybe the closest i could come up with is maybe you will finish the book and maybe you wo n't !
i gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked after reading all the reviews i thought it would be an outstanding read but for me it was plain old b o r i n since it did n't pick up by page 100 i figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time sorry i vote two thumbs down on this one
repetative dull poorly written and really dumb as other reviewers note it is tough to find anything in here that you do n't already know probably even if you have never owned a cat and if you think that you will learn cat speak whatever that is do n't hold your breath the entire section is less than a chapter and the chapters are n't much my sister gave this to me thinking that it would help us with our two cats use it for litter
this is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but does n't understand i was expecting some new information about a secret language '' there was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog so what 's the secret '' i agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip the author says that cats do not get lonely well that 's wrong he also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served how does one explain cats who live with homeless street people the title was deceiving
there is way too much going on in this glamour indian mythology anthropology domestic violence rates down with romance novels this is definately not the author 's best i am thinking of giving up on it a big disappointment !
this book was nothing but painful to try and get through though i sometimes enjoy jodi picoult 's writing picture perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable i spent a lot of time rolling my eyes shaking my head thinking come on give me a break i stopped the torture about 60 of the way through giving up the hope that i had indeed wasted pretentious unbelievable boring pathetic story line save yourself the money and the this jodi picoult novel by
this book was readable and somewhat compelling in that i wanted to know what would happen next however the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character 's lives a ucla professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband it reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that does n't require any more time than giving lectures with apparently no preparation going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it and traveling to exotic places to do research that was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book i had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it it was like watching a soap opera a guilty pleasure
this is the story of cassie who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la cassie suffers from amnesia and we do n't know what brought her there until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife this is by far the most disappointing of picoult 's books and i 've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers cassie is amnesic yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened the story goes back and forth between the present the past the memories and leaves readers lost in the middle i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion what is frustrating is that it takes picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing let alone her husband alex a massive egocentric the story was very confused mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa with anthropology indian legends domestic violence alcoholism amnesia it was just too much for one book and the message was confused if you want a superb story of domestic violence read black blue by anna quindlen if you want a good picoult book read the pact or my sister 's keeper but definitely not picture perfect
in this book gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that experts know more than other people that if you spend years doing something or researching it or training you will be able to spot more details than others a real
historically inaccurate a painfully rushed third act and not up to the high standards set by philippa gregory 's other tudor novels it reads like something written by a romance author what amazed me was the author 's decision to write a katharine of aragon that bore absolutely no resemblance to the historical figure i 've found all her previous tudor character studies to be incredibly believeable notwithstanding elizabeth i 's excessive randiness in the virgin 's lover anne boleyn jane seymour anne of cleves henry viii himself all seem to come alive why then is katharine of aragon groping her husband on her wedding night dressing in the tudor equivalent of a naughty negligee and seducing her for the sake of politics this racy '' view is completely at odds with every historical source which portrays catalina de aragon as a intensely religious reserved woman who would never repeatedly perjure herself for a rigorously devoted roman catholic to live such a lie her entire life to say nothing of the sexual politics she is depicted as playing would be live a life of sin there is nothing in the historical record to ever suggest katharine would choose that path if philippa gregory wants to write a purely fictitious of katharine of aragon that 's fine i 've always wanted more exploration of what her life might have been like if prince arthur had n't died but to claim this character is based on fact is both laughable and insulting to all authors who strive for historical accuracy
the other boleyn girl '' and the queen 's fool '' are two of the best books i 've ever read and i 've read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin 's lover '' fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source and times when it 's harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i 'm going back to trollope
after reading the other bolyne girl '' i was keen to read another novel by philippa gregory however this was a very disappointing read it is poorly written the story was not engaging and there was little could not even bring myself to finish this novel
i have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time i could n't force myself to get to the end continually i turned the page in hopes it would get better but it did n't the way she moves the point of view from katharine back to the story is not enjoyable i would hate not to enjoy philippa gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again
i think dr oz is a fantastic doctor and i have heard him speak on tv but i did not find any useful information in this book for my life
this is the worst book i have ever read is very dull and bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it i wish i can return it and get a i have threogh it in the tras
i agree with the average review in the book edition area however it is one thing to read jesse said '' after every friggin time the character says a line but to hear it spoken by scott sowers ' mouth over and over and over and over it is just too much listen to another book where the reader at least inflects his voice differently for different characters i almost quit hearing it on the first cd but the story line finally caught me enough to suffer and i use that word carefully through the rest of the story
the good first there is a lot of good i enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal my husband and i have a great marriage he knows i have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me he is certainly not ever wanting more sex just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes in jest i 'm sure i say that to show that not coming from a prude the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it 's normal i am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice it was dealt with like it 's a fact so get used to it your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night the men give accounts of this like oh well does n't mean i do n't love my wife in my opinion just they are n't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts does n't mean it 's i found the book to be very very discouraging that a bunch of married christian men would unapologetically key word here see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less we 're not talking lingerie here and think about what she 's like in bed or what her nipples look like there 's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart or maybe they should not do this it really threw me for a loop ! i guess i did n't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are not that i think they do n't want a lot of it but i found it discouraging for christian wives to think that their husbands ca n't go to work without picturing everyone naked i found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it 's normal '' and women just need to get used to the idea
the stuff in this book might be true but that does n't mean i 'm going to change my life just to please some man i always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that or go find another woman end of story
unfortunately this book is only going to help you if you 're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who 's let herself go for the modern woman with common sense and who does n't have her man beg her for sex for instance this book is completely useless i can think of a few women who 'd benefit from it church ladies but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman i also found shaunti feldhahn 's way of writing very anoying at the beggining of the book it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever i get it respect the man there 's no need to say it 30 times with different words it was definitly a waste of money
rieux the main character of the novel moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner he goes thru the motions of doing his job '' while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague i find jose saramago 's blindess '' to be a far superior book to the plague similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving the plague was clinical in its approach almost bloodless i found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to often having to many pages over and over i would pass on this book
the theory '' expressed here is really nothing new and seems like repackaged emotional intelligence and other ideas the author continually uses personal stories and anecdotal evidence as proof of many of his ideas while i agree that iq does not tell the whole story this book does n't add anything new or unique to the discussion
from such a expert as sternberg this is quite a disappointment not representative of a doctoral candidate at all as if suffering from the assertions could have been to half its length with a focus on the claims of the last 10 pages instead you wade through tedious defects of tests and personal family events that reveal a very ordinary insight early on probably his underclass research assistant we are tipped off to its underwhelming conclusion when we come upon some of the studies this one too showing that iq tells you little of what you want to know about what makes for success regardless of life pursuit '' when finally heading down to the crux of the book sternberg digresses once again about one of his own love theories '' that has little to say about the persistence of successful intelligence this tome should be placed several libraries away from the erudition of william james or john locke who both reveal at every sentence the working of an intellect ted kaczynski has more thoughts on why successful intellects struggle in today 's society than the professor could uncover compares to the topical fare of david reuben
sternberg 's fills this book with a little too many personal anecdotes with himself as central figure to feel comfortable with the objectivity of his scholarship the title should be attributes of successful people but it does not seem to be about intelligence nor does the author seem to have a consistent meaning for the term intelligence at times he expands his generally valid complaints about intelligence tests to include acheivement and all other tests despite the fact that they presumably measure acheived knowledge and not ability or potential to learn there is little to explain why he settled on just his three types of intelligence analytical creative and practical and at times he seems to be implicitly accept some of gardner 's such as spatial intelligence
i picked up this book after seeing david sedaris on a late night talk show he seemed hilarious almost like a younger bemused woodie allen type while the book is well written his views on life are very disappointing to me in his previous of life he was a a loafer well basically a bum many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives these folks were getting in the way of david 's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs he can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and ca n't put enough blame on those around them
when i first looked at this book at the bookstore i thought great son has adhd and was looking for a change in his diet to help however the book just barely skims any one topic with a paragraph or two if you 're lucky on anyone subject and has no depth to it at all if you 're just looking for the tip of the iceburg this is it there is nothing more than an overview to any subject when it comes to amounts dosages for supplements or nutrients and the amount needed about half way through i quit reading it since it was of no help other than a broad spectrum overview the myth of learning robin pauc i think was much better at first glance and actually had dosages for supplements to know where to start and why this or that would help brain function etc hope this helps
the information in this book is n't that much as you might think the title is misleading in a way it does n't help to make you more popular just because the information is n't much ! i 've read this book in just 30 ! minutes the book has 124 pages approximately so it 's clear the information is n't that much
it 's healthy bear in mind as horgan urges that neuroscience has yet to produce medical or technological breakthroughs on the scale of physics chemistry or other areas of biology of which neuroscience is a subfield btw research programs in the field would do well to be more influenced by these priorities but as far as his grander negative conclusions regarding the futility of neuroscience are concerned the book is an unmitigated failure indeed the discussion of neuroscience is so thin and his arguments so specious that one suspects that horgan is really quite content just to provide a set of tom talking points for those who are already suspicious or frightened of the empirical study of mind horgan 's negative claims are not borne out by an honest look at the field for example he professes not to be able to come up with a single solid discovery that neuroscience has made in its history really what about the discovery of receptive fields by kuffler and others a fundamental fact about sensory and motor neural organization every student learns how about functional neural columns in hubel wiesel and elsewhere the neural correlate of eye movement commands in the superior colliculus wurtz goldberg et and what exactly was the objection to kandel 's groundbreaking work on the molecular basis of memory supposed to be rather horgan 's methodology is to exploit the modesty and of many neuroscientists who will say of course we have no idea how x works ' to temper the enthusiasm surrounding their discovery of but modesty or jadedness notwithstanding no neuroscientist believes that the field has learned nothing important about the brain in the last 100 years or that important questions have n't been answered definitively horgan also offers a sort of argument from he and his colleagues at scientific american ca n't get their heads around 's work in an afternoon it must be beyond human comprehension altogether other interpretations of the situation are possible in sum a grossly misleading book
john morgan has lost himself in such skeptical toughts in summary he does not believe in sience in knowledge in knowning patterns in medicine in neurology in anything it adds very little instead of bad mood do n't waste your money
i tried reading it and made it about pages i 'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign i seem to recall sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy '' guess what sedaris i do n't give a expletive deleted about your bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough 's books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style
if you could do one thing better than god would you still believe i would like you to imagine for a moment a mother 's love i think we can all agree the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind in any time or culture now imagine you are the mother of two children one boy and one girl their ages are unimportant got the image in your head great now imagine one child is always a troublemaker quite a little heathen if you will the child never listens to anything you say gets in trouble at school and even sometimes says they hate you child number two is a perfect little angel always does what they are told hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep of course you may discipline the naughty child but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world of course you say well let 's see late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames knowing both children are inside and could be burning alive at this very moment you know you need to make a quick judgement which child will you save what both you say why would you save both children what because you love both of them why one child is a complete terror and does n't even love you ! ! ! why would you do such a thing god would n't ! ! what you say god has unconditional love even more than a mere human mother really well let 's take a look at the god of love for just a moment god has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or believe '' in him with fire for all eternity does that sound like unconditional love to you if i as a mere human mother can love my children with the unconditional love that god can not does he truly love and forgive better than us silly '' humans that he supposedly created think about that or are we all just ignorant children hoping that our father 's '' approval with strict unrealistic conditions equals love you decide can you do something better than god i can so can most parents i know it 's called loving without conditions sure we set rules but we do n't punish with a smoldering pit what you say if he did n't love us he would n't have sent jesus to save '' us and forgive our sins we 'll believing in jesus is still a condition is n't it something to think about ps the sins of god include murder of the whole world except the ark impregnating a virgin rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament etc etc etc if a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever yet we excuse god by saying he knows what 's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is god our american laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of god who can not keep his own commandments if god was truly a perfect being he would have known in his all time seeing vision '' that we would mess up and he would n't have tested eve with the apple if god never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out if god did n't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it i thought god knew everything frankly i 've seen better administrative work during the clinton administration and that 's saying something when will the educated wealthy countries learn to spread hope through actual tangible help to third world nations instead of helping '' them with false promises of heaven or the fear of hellfire while we steal their oil diamonds and hope we have battered those weaker than us with our religion '' for far too long somebody stop the planet this saved '' catholic lutheran baptist turned evangelical atheist wants to get off angela san antonio texas
how do you make a career preaching about the end of the world we 've been in the end times '' since the death of christ hagee has been using fear and emotion to take advantage and brainwash people for such a long time it 's crazy any christian with an average knowledge of the bible can see that hagee has indeed made up his own gospel to all my fellow christians stop reading and buying into this end of the world hype concentrate on your own spiritual growth and witness to others do n't be so quick to hate muslims either
john hagee has got to be one of the most ignorant uneducated bumpkins ever to have been published in this country jerusalem countdown '' reads like a book report slapped together by a 15 year old simpleton its horribly written pages are with blatantly false and of course historical assertions certifiable paranoia religious bias compares catholicism with satanism and paganism and worst of all a false gospel supported by the most moronic biblical exegesis i 've heard since david koresh was holed up with the branch davidians at waco hagee believes that jews do not need to accept christ to be saved and that we must unconditionally support israel to the point of making war on its enemies specifically iran this book would be laughable if this judaizer did n't have the ear of presidents and the loyalty of millions of credulous followers to give a few examples of the level of scholarship '' in this book on pg 65 he says that 1 million jews were living in israel at the time of the crucifixion on pg 68 he says that 1.1 million jews were killed during the siege of jerusalem a few decades later did more jews than existed in the whole land of israel somehow crowd into the city of jerusalem knowing that they would be more easily slaughtered there on pg 69 hagee writes that hellenistic christians '' abandoned the jewish christians during the seige thereby bringing about the permanent separation of gentile and jewish followers of christ his history is just not true leaving aside his unintelligible statement about causing a separation '' the records tell us simply that christians left jerusalem for pella during the seige in any case hagee must have been confused when he wrote that because a few pages later 72 he says that it was the edict of milan in the year 313 which caused the separation of jew and christian since i 'm at a loss as to how the legalization of christianity could cause a rift that in reality existed since the time of the apostles i 'll just go on to quote his hilarious statement that because of the edict the roman church grew in power until it ruled most of the known world through papal states '' another funny one was when he quoted the early church fathers as calling the jews shylocks '' pg 72 since that word was only coined by shakespeare some 1200 years or so after the church fathers i was glad to see a rare citation next to the quote unfortunately hagee 's source for the quote was one of his own books ! he also says pg 78 that martin luther died two days after writing his famous tract against the jews presumably as punishment from god for daring to speak against his chosen people '' in reality luther died 3 years after the publication of on the jews and their lies '' hagee claims that the catholic church and hitler conspired '' to exterminate the jews the pope not only publicly condemned nazism but saved somewhere around jews from death according to jewish historians the pope 's intercession for the jews was so great that the chief rabbi of rome converted to catholicism after the war and took the pope 's name as his own hagee claims that the name of the city of moscow is derived from hebrew pg 104 and that russia will invade israel because it needs a warm water port and access to oil there are plenty of warm water ports a lot closer than israel and it was just reported that russia has the largest oil reserves in the world even larger than saudi arabia hagee also dishonestly leaves the impression that russia is still an officially atheistic nation the better to shoehorn it into his warped eschatology which he incompetently and incompletely cribbed from the late great planet earth '' anyway the list goes on and on of course the main problem is not hagee 's demonstrable historical ignorance but his warped theological ideas i do n't even know why hagee is a christian minister except perhaps he best serves his israeli masters through his influence over us stupid goyim hagee delights in calling jesus christ a prominent jewish rabbi from nazareth '' he says that jesus was not a christian pg 66 hagee like the first century judaizers condemned by paul peter and every single early christian of authority believes that the old covenant is still in effect this belief is a contradiction of basic christianity and it is a testament to the theological ignorance of his followers that he has not been cast from the pulpit in disgrace i guess when you live in a country where anyone can start his own church '' any theological concept can get off the ground especially with enough israeli shekels hagee 's church is entitled evangelical nondenominational '' two of the most meaningless and disingenuous terms in current parlance in practice that means that hagee runs a personality cult that is answerable to no denominational authority except perhaps the republican party or the israeli embassy he describes jesus as an angry radical '' hagee ignores the fact that the old covenant was conditional dt and despite frequent forgiveness by god the hebrews constantly rejected god 's mercy culminating in the crucifixion of the savior jesus said that anyone who rejects him rejects the one who sent him lk hagee simply twists and misrepresents scripture to such a degree that it 's very difficult to ascribe a charitable explanation for his exegesis he has powerful financial supporters he has to satisfy the gospel be damned the entire new testament proclaims the end of the old covenant and its replacement by a better way 2 cor heb hagee describes that christian message as '' to cite all the new testament verses as well as old testament foreshadowing would fill up this entire page suffice it to say jesus christ said i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me '' jn john hagee would probably report him to the league
before i start let me nail my colours to the mast i 'm i 'm i really like the idea of rational enquiry and i 'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical i 'm some hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a sign on the side of my kombi honestly now we 've got that cleared up let me say it straight this book takes on some big arguments but other than humorously swatting some flies loses hands down all it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers losers charlatans and wankers to be found in the social sciences departments of any given university anyone who 's been to university and did n't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class now either sokal did n't know that or he 's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel that might seem like good sport but before long it becomes obvious it 's a cheap thrill having said that i sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb french feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash i think it 's because of sokal 's purported intent to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science in particular the work of thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend this is the battle sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth the barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down while the poseurs cited in this book are certainly for the most part phoneys or idiots i think thomas kuhn was neither and while paul feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand he had some important things to say too so to the first point proving that one writer or a hundred or a thousand who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan does n't establish anything about of relativism all you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan give yourself a star but while you 're pinning it on remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical bamboozling balderdash example sir roger penrose emeritus rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university no less and his dreadful and deliberately bamboozling tract the emperor 's new mind '' the very point of the no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was roger penrose and his arguments on ai really blow the kumara example noam chomsky and steven pinker 's linguistic nativism which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments and is anything but nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology from my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language my impression is that pinker 's and chomsky 's arguments are seriously flawed see sampson the language instinct debate '' for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism see rorty contingency irony and solidarity '' for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language make note of this example as it becomes relevant later on secondly sokal and bricmont quite deliberately refuse to engage on certain topics in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism which they say without providing a reason raise very different issues '' take that star away for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism actually ethical aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of the same issue cognitive relativism in that it relates to epistemic '' truth as opposed to moral '' truth or aesthetic '' truth both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas is simply a cut closer to the quick indeed the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language thirdly sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism '' while scientists try to obtain an objective view of the world relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is in principle an illusion '' now that to put it mildly is a punchy version of relativism and not one that any credible relativist philosopher i know of and certainly not thomas kuhn who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works subscribes to that is in the trade known as a argument you set it up to knock it over here goes relativists say science is a waste of time science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility therefore science has genuine utility ergo science is not a waste of time case closed is relativism dead no the problem is most relativists i know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. the cat is most definitely still out of the bag in a nutshell all reasonably stated relativism says is that you ca n't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world it may it may not logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data however implausible or difficult to imagine and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in and description of the world in terms of the current paradigm '' relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that for now your theory works not that it is though sokal and bricmont may disagree i do n't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor really scientists lastly in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher sylvia kristeva sokal makes the following footnote '' kristeva seems to be appealing to the thesis ' in linguistics that is that our language radically conditions our view of the world this thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists see for example pinker '' hold the phone the implication is that the thesis as to the contingency of language has been discredited but by none other than steven pinker in his the language instinct '' which as per the above is at the very least a controversial piece of writing this is an extremely important point since it 's utterly central to the credibility of the cause and if one takes geoffrey sampson 's book cited above at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research it seems to me and to writers like richard rorty that language must radically condition our view of the world because that 's the only basis on which we can even describe it at the end of the day properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse except that it relegates the scientist from truth knower '' or person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth '' sounds a bit like a grand high or dare i say it high priest does n't it to person whose theory works the best for now '' and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they 're scientists if science work better than feng shui or healing crystals and i for one think it does then this should n't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community so it makes the reactions against relativism from the likes of sokal and elsewhere richard dawkins all the more mystifying olly buxton
to begin with this review does not deal with the whole of sokal and bricmont 's work only with the chapter on deleuze in essence all the authors do in this section are quote long passages from deleuze work and his collaborations with guattari that deal with the philosophical issues surrounding scientific concepts or functions in deleuze terminology and then make a pejorative comment without any substantiation for example the end is totally devoid of meaning '' the end of the passage is meaningless '' it is devoid of both logic and sense '' those parts of the quoted passages that the authors as any careful reader do not find meaningless '' are dismissed as banal observations '' or sometimes banal '' or dealing with issues in the philosophy of science that the authors believe were settled for ever 150 years ago and so we may imply should never be discussed again it is possible i guess that a rigorous scientific analysis of deleuze philosophical writings may be able to point out some scientific error but the authors offer nothing but unproven ejaculations that would seem to say that anything correct in their opinion is so obvious it is not worth saying and anything they have not been able to understand has no meaning at all sokal made his name by perpetrating a hoax and that seems to be the pony 's only trick too bad
while i myself had not actually read the book the problems i see with this work is tautologically apparent pias works on an objective logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available recent works have started to combine the gap between current science and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach i refer the reader to sokal 1996 our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself but until then reserve judgement
reading this 'leadership pipeline ' i became really astonished of seeing here all the ideas of elliott jaques and gillian stamp bioss international just copied with no reference to them i keep wondering how can that be done jaques and gillian stamp has written for so many years about human capability and seven levels of work complexity that are clearly repeated in this book withouth no comment to them even the general themes are there for example managing other leader of leader managing a business unit managing a group of business unit if you do n't beleive me just read requisite organization jaques and previous ones for example and you will learn that jaques ' ideas are being developed for more than 30 years so better learn with the real creative people that has really done researches around the theme
terrible ! sounded good from the synopsis a hidden world beneath the polar ice caps and a team put together to go explore when another team goes missing but the characters were so wooden and annoying that i fervently hoped all of them would die violently at the hands well teeth of the type creatures who live in the underground world you had the stereotypical single mom who brings her brat with her the military guy she eventually beds and the evil arabic archetype who wants to blow everything up i ca n't even bother to give more detail than that it 's not worth it i 'm surprised i even finished it
being in the fire service for nearly 10 years and an instructor this book does well for individuals with a decent level of fire knowledge however for the fundamental student or beginner fire fighter this book lacks serious explinations of the basic concepts this book has done nothing but confuse students with it 's constant bombardment of calculations without providing clear explinations outside sources are constantly used to supliment what this book lacks if it 's used for a begining fire engineering or as a suppliment book for fire behavior i would recommend it but the lack of the fundamentals that it mystically tries to build on is extremely frustrating and lacks any sort of foundation advanced levels i 'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 beginner levels i 'd give it a 1 out of
i thought it would be much more exciting but it was not what i thought it would be
i found that the author 's philosophical ramblings were as uninformative as they were boring i recommend this book to those suffering from insomnia

i admire vollman 's ambition in this novel he is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion buddhism christianity and paganism commentary on the differences similarities of love lust and addiction capitalism versus marxism racism between all colors of all people classicism reality and fantasy misogyny unions or depending how you look at it the list goes on and this is exactly the problem with it the connections are vague not subtle fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness ready to fall if i were vollman i would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense maybe map out this royal family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers his characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate i do n't advise giving up on him yet he has potential but i do n't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired
there 's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject but winchester abuses the privilege there 's no digression too minute no reference too arcane no place where one word ca n't be replaced with 100. when he does finally get to a set of pertinent points the writing is excellent that 's what kept me from giving it a worse review too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of mixed nuts if you 're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets the book is worth your time otherwise pass on it
crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory the plot is laughable the writing is sloppy the dialogue is didactic this is trash not even good trash too bad to see the author of andromeda strain sink so low shame on him
i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references '' to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility '' but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet
may be as damaging as out and out lies i think crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth one of these that i found most disturbing was the antagonists statement that ddt was not proven to be harmful maybe so but the chemical reaction something that happens quite often in nature ddt has with some soils leads to dde which is very harmful to native species it reminds me of bowling for columbine whether you like micheal moore or not he had a thesis about how afraid americans are made to feel why do you lock your door at night if someone wants to get in they will moore touches on but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in american society crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups he portrays these organizations very well however the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world check the fbi website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago !
an important test of any theory is how much evidence exists for its case in this book doherty proposes that christianity began with a celestial christ who was thought to be crucified in a celestial realm above the earth and that paul 's letters as they currently stand speak only of a christ in fact doherty makes this claim for all the new testament epistles which are thus presented as direct evidence people describing their own belief and thus directly attesting to the existence of the belief one trouble facing doherty 's thesis is that paul 's letters and the other early christian documents speak of christ 's flesh and blood and his birth and death they also provide other indications of a terrestrial savior so a large part of doherty 's book consists of arguments to the effect that all these words really referred to a spiritual '' death in the heavens a great deal of work has already been advanced against these arguments and it does not need to be repeated here except to say that no single piece of evidence for doherty 's thesis exists which is not ambiguous doherty hardly denies this ambiguity since it is his own contention that even the most passages in the new testament can be dismissed as metaphor rather than plain evidence for a historical christ thus the main argument of this book is about a lack of evidence that is to say an argument from silence doherty claims that the first ancient christians are silent about an earthly christ again much prior work has been done to show that this is far from true what i find interesting is that an argument from silence though difficult to make and not generally favored by historians can be legitimate especially if combined with positive evidence in this case if we could not combine it with such evidence we would face new arguments from silence that contradicted doherty 's thesis why are the proposed believers in the celestial christ silent about so many details of their heavenly savior and why do we not find ancient christians jews and pagans reporting or reacting to doctrines about a celestial christ in this book doherty deals only with the second of these two questions he looks for ancient authors who tell us that others either believed in a celestial christ or doubted the terrestrial christ since no ancient author tells us clearly about people who doubted that christ appeared to be a man on the earth doherty proposes that we can find hints of such a thing in appendix 3 of this book he quotes a letter by ignatius of antioch to the magnesians written at the start of the second century wherein ignatius hopes that his readers will attain full assurance in regard to the birth and passion and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of pontius pilate '' magnesians this seems to doherty like a polemic against a celestial christ the principle he is using is a valid one akin to when mainstream scholars use paul 's assurances about the resurrection in 1 corinthians 15 as evidence that doubts about the resurrection existed but in that case paul tells us clearly what the doubts were ignatius does not and it will be worth a little effort here to go into the details ignatius says earlier in his letter that some deny the death of christ today we call this the docetic doctrine which held that christ merely appeared to be a human being but was actually only a spirit who appeared to die on the cross this doctrine is because so much ancient christian literature seeks to refute it and doherty rightfully regards these refutations as different from the refutation that he is looking for the proposed polemic against a christ who did not even appear to walk on the earth yet ignatius mentions nothing like that he alludes to docetism and to unspecified doctrines denying that christ was the same as the one true god and he refers very specifically to judaism just before making his assurance about the birth death and resurrection in the time of pilate 's governorship of judea he is telling his readers in short to have full assurance about things that both docetism and judaism are known to have challenged the nature of this or any proposed savior 's birth his passion under the roman leadership in a jewish province and his resurrection doherty thinks that ignatius is asking his readers to be fully persuaded '' of the bare facts of these things the bare fact that they took place but it hardly seems probable that ignatius would be content to ask for that he is asking his readers to attain full assurance '' about all of the church 's interpretations and teachings concerning these things to keep from straying into any kind of doctrinal dispute so he writes throughout his letter the ambiguity of doherty 's evidence prompts him to argue that there is so little clear evidence because orthodox christianity changed destroyed or neglected the evidence that was once there he uses this argument openly in a chapter claiming that at least some christians worshipped only god and rejected all savior figures doherty presents the writings of minucius felix as a smoking gun '' to that effect but he allows that the evidence is not as clear as we might want he tells us that it is the best evidence that can be expected because clearer statements would never have reached us through 2000 years of christian censorship '' see 292 that is the conspiracy theory considering that christianity has not wiped away all evidence of doctrines that it regarded as heresies but instead has offered refutations of every heresy and preserved these refutations as a guide to the true faith doherty 's claim is hard to believe a conspiracy to hide the truth can take place christians not excepted the record of the past can be doctored and has been but doherty 's specific claim is that christianity 's very first doctrines contained a purely celestial christ and that these doctrines have not been preserved even as heresy with ignatius serving as a brief and ambiguous exception christianity 's true origin was wiped away not with refutation and doctoring but with silence it is hard to believe that christian institutions and individual writers were silent about what would have been the most radical and provocative of all the heresies silent about an idea that per doherty 's central thesis about how religions work would have threatened the church 's power to a greater degree than any of the other heresies some of which were already regarded by church fathers as mortally dangerous to the church so doherty proposes one additional reason to explain the silence he suggests that the roman war against palestine in the year 70 uprooted or destroyed so many lives that later writers could claim that christ had lived there in recent decades without challenges from locals who remembered either the true situation or the beliefs of the sect that worshipped a christ see pages 168 and 179 doherty 's picture is of a dying sect but a fundamental claim of doherty 's idea is the pervasiveness in the entire ancient world of the belief in saviors who descended to celestial regions above the earth and experienced pain or death there had this sort of belief really been ubiquitous throughout the empire and applied to christ as far as the church in rome to whom paul addresses his longest letter one war in judea could not have extinguished the belief and even in judea it would be likely to reappear ignatius himself per doherty is proof that the belief survived the war but if doherty is right we would expect such a popular doctrine to have flourished after the war we 'd expect the orthodox sects of the church proclaiming an earthly savior to produce some refutations the fathers established in rome the center of all ideas would surely have encountered or heard of the celestial christ for doherty does not address how the celestial christ of paul 's letter to the romans was just forgotten except by returning to the idea of censorship i invite any reader attracted by this book to work out doherty 's scenario and to test it repeatedly against the available information about the time period that 's an external test then test it against its own premises repeatedly for an internal test it is a worthy and rewarding challenge
the culture cult is an ascerbic sarcastic text that is more concerned with browbeating readers with its stringent defence of western civilization than examining tribal cultures beyond mere stereotypes i originally picked up this book because i was interested in the results of the romanticisation of tribal cultures the tendency to romanticise tribal cultures as being closer to nature and more at one with nature has a long history especially among colonial settlers though in their haste to be seen as higher animals of course there was less romanticization and more condescending observation often this romanticization does not fit with the events of the past but sandall is no objective commentator attempting to see similarities between civilization and tribal culture and temper romanticization of tribalism he is batting for civilization denigrating tribal cultures as wasteful ignorant unaware and incapable of connecting with the environment in an ecologically sound way for example his claim that maori first wiped out the moa then the seals before turning to cannibalism displays scant regard for new zealand history in his desperation to prove that tribal cultures annihilated the environment as western civiliztion has does and will continue to do pp 122 of course sandall is actually trying to prove that tribal cultures were worse than civilization the one fact in this example that sandall manages to get right is that the moa were decimated by maori not so the seals european sealers arrived in new zealand in their hundreds at the beginning of the to join in the sealing trade with grave consequences for seal populations but sealing stopped in the and the seal population is slowly recovering go to kaikoura and have a gawk roger ! the comment after using up all the large birds and mammals the polynesians now began to eat each other '' 122 is fantastical yes there was cannibalism between tribes during or as a result of warfare if sandall wants to present cannibalism he has a duty to do just a smidge of research rather than merely extrapolate what he would like to believe new zealand was not a nation before the signing of the treaty of waitangi in 1840 and a number of maori tribes lived on the islands as individual tribes there were alliances between some tribes and often wars were fought over land and resouces cannibalism occurred between tribes after wars in a ritualistic manner that has been documented in other tribes cannibalism did not occur because people were hungry predation by other hungry humans '' according to sandall nor as sandall negligently suggests did they eat their own '' there are many factual inaccuracies throughout this book sandall depicts tribal cultures as barbaric and less evolved than civilization which i am sure he and many of his readers find very soothing but this adds little to modern debates this book is a bitter diatribe for people who want to believe in the superiority of western civilization polarising tribal culture and civilization just fuels exaggerated stereotypes and offers no real solutions to how countries with indigenous populations who predated and were taken advantage of and abused by colonial settlements australia new zealand canada america are to move forward into the future together
this book was lacking something there were alot of times in the book where it dragged and i was tempted to put it down i was simply disappointed with this book i do n't think that e lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse
it seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best just include the words power prestige wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life power talk fails to live up to its title it is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about but it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two this book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably wo n't help much the key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary structure etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title
i really do n't think that changing my voice mail will help me succeed in my corporation the author talks about mixing two forms of language edge and center to have a perfect communication with the people you work with employees employers boss etc and never tells you how to mix these concepts and besides if a certain form of language works for me center or edge i really do n't see the point on changing the way i never close a book forever before finishing it but after reading a couple of pages after the middle of the book and realized that i could be reading something else so i decided to stop with the torture
when i saw the only fitness book you will ever need '' in the title i probably examined the book a little more closely than most it is broken into 3 parts cardio nutrition and weight training the part on weight training was great could n't find a fault most people will complain that he does n't go in detail on proper form but i have lifted before so i did n't see anything wrong the nutrition part is were you will lose the average person first of all it is extremely expensive why you ask it seems according to frank 's plan the more you weigh the more you need to eat i weigh 220 lbs and ca n't afford the protein part of the program does this guy have a clue how much meat and eggs cost he has you buying chicken and eggs like it was water ! ! also you better have a friend that works at he has you using that too you ever price that stuff hey frank you do realize that some of us have a mortgage right oh yes cardio i had an easier time in advanced calculus he has you figure out you maximum heart rate i thought great wait a minute you are not done you must figure out the range and work out at 50 to 70 of that number then i thought how do i know if i am at 70 of my mhr while i am on a bike frank says to buy a heart monitor ! ! ! god only knows how much that will cost ! ! ! i will finish by saying this the trouble when bodybuiders write a book is that they think the average person has the time and money that they do frank sepe is a world class bodybuilder actor and now an author so i think it 's pretty safe to say he makes a lot more than my a year if i had his income i could then afford his program also he must realize that most of us do n't want to look like him i 'd be happy just losing 20 pounds and lowering my cholesterol not enter a universe '' contest i would be much better off with a book that is more realistic if this is the only fitness book you 'll ever need '' then you are in big trouble

i found the book had some ideas that helped but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual but i did n't appreciate the religious opinion it gave
i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making and the consequence of their decision remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors do n't want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position which i would have respected if not agreed with then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i would n't have spent the 22 i would have wanted to know that in advance tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book buyer bewar
this book reads like an encyclopedia of random shortcuts of keystrokes to cut down your use of clicky buttons i found it very difficult to just read from chapter to chapter because of the format the information is published in an assembly of brief descriptions of tasks one after the other i couldnt just start at page 1 and read to the back cover i 'm not sure if the mac verson of photoshop shows the shortcuts in every menu and like the pc does so i cant speak for them but pretty much every function that has a keystroke shortcut on the pc has that keystroke noted the tips in this book were for the most part useless to me because over time i 've learned the shortcuts that were the most used by me i dont recommend this book to anyone but a beginner with photoshop the cover price of the book does not justify the few tips that could be useful replace this book instead by memorizing the shortcuts as you see them in the menus and try the help function in the program itself edit i purchased this book because i loved the authors book titled down and dirty tricks '' i definately recommend that book instead
using this book and depends upon being able to download the customized settings so that the reader 's photoshop for example behaves the same way as the author 's photoshop however my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the furthermore this author does n't start at a dummies '' level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons so i had trouble following along overall this was n't much help for me in my quest to learn photoshop from a baseline of complete ignorance
the idea of this book a collection of short stories that explore the rich phenomenon of why people ride motorcycles is terrific but the execution is disgusting anyone genuinely clueless and curious about why people ride would get a perverse enlightenment from she 's a bad motorcycle just one story from a hell 's angel perspective would have been plenty instead most of the selections are from motorcycle gang members who are too busy bragging about raping terrorizing torturing and pillaging to bother with good writing few ever get around to the subject of what motorcycle riding means to them zanetti also seems to have trouble finding a ride out of california the other 49 states are severely under represented the only reason this book is worth even 2 stars is that it includes a couple token gems that deserve far better company entries from melissa holbrook pierson robert fulton and a handful of others are n't enough to make the book worth buying but they are well worth reading on their own
the storm upon us everything seems new and strange nothing seems certain masses of people are tangibly deprived of their claims to this revolution is steadily creating the predicate for its own collapse the prospect of an economic or political cataclysm of unknown dimension these and similar claims are found on just the first two pages of the book to be fair greider also references the great fortunes thrown off by globalization and the fact that millions escape poverty but right from the start you get the feeling that he is working backwards from his conclusions and choosing his rhetoric and his examples to sell his point of view it s almost as if greider is suggesting that now that the west has gone through the very sort of radical transformation he describes with shock and dismay the rest of humanity should just stay where they are at while we in the industrialized world figure out if and how they should reach for the security and the lifestyle that we take for granted if you are looking to validate an bias you already hold then this may be the book for you but i think it s fair to say that most readers would like to benefit from greider s considerable experience and expertise without having to interpret his selective or overly cynical presentation in a nutshell my problem with the book is not that it argues against globalization and is wrong but that it is as committed to persuasion as it is to education i chose not to finish the book and will look for a more neutral resource
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns germs more than the other 2 and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs collapse '' a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now
i agree with haus i was also disappointed the interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming unlike the one on the cover i prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern feel rather than something straight out of a tour of benjamin franklin 's century home not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the haus review makes me wonder if they know the author personally
i think the hallmark of good design is the ability to maintain that integrity while also moving with some elements of style from the period in which you actually live i guess the title really means classic interiors '' the book shows how to create interiors that would have looked appropriate in 1763. today a number of the interiors come across as dark overwhelming and provincial the photographs viewable on amazon are misleading because the interiors pictured are more simple more modern and brighter than most of those photographed in the book i would take a long look at it before investing if you prefer simple classic design to stringently historical interiors also as an aside the book seems to utilize an older understanding of acceptable paint colors for colonials darker duller colors others such as martha stewart 's books proclaim that newer research shows that slightly brighter shades were actually used more often than previously believed
i had a difficult time with this book having ready flags of our fathers '' i had hopes this would be as well written and informitive however from early on this book came across as just another piece of pagan liberal propoganda '' the ethnic cleansing of american indians by the united states was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there the pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the united states does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions this book is another pagan apologetic for what 's wrong with the us and right with all nations who wish us ill
my greatest problem with this book was it 's appearence of blaming america for the woes of japan and excusing excesses in time of war the author gave me the impression that he was more willing to forgive japanese excesses in battle while condeming america for it 's methods to end the war i grant the author 's expertise in the access to a personal source for the battle of iwo jima near by but i can not accept his rationalization of japanese atrocities as a cost of war then condem the americans for their bombing the enemy homeland fire and nuclear to destroy their will and ability to wage war overall the book is well written and provides an insight to the mentality of the japanese military during the war
i give james bradley much credit for making this important though unpalatable story better known we need to realize that as human beings americans are not significantly better or worse than most others especially when tested by the extremes of war however bradley 's basic writing skills as evidenced in this book are not appropriate to an important historical volume he jumps back and forth between between ordinary colloquialisms and formal historical style he uses the first names of historical figures curtis '' for lemay some of his descriptions of firestorm effects are much overdrawn and unrealistic there are internal contradictions he frequently uses sarcasm which is completely inappropriate for a serious work of history it is most unfortunate that his poor writing has much diminished the contribution that this book could have made further a great annoyance is the word flyboys '' i lived through wwii and my older brothers were in the pacific theater throughout one was a naval air crewman who flew many missions over japan in those days i do not recall ever hearing the word flyboys '' used to describe any of our own or the enemy 's air personnel i find the word sarcastic and derogatory
this book up to the very end was very good with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half the end is what ruins the entire thing do n't worry i 'm not going to spoil anything i 'll just say the ending stinks out loud ! this story is not really horror its sifi a it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough the writting was dead on as always and character development was good this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book
the authors make several references to a set of plans and list of materials that are included with this book but these appear to be missing i would not try to build a masonry oven with this book but it is a good start
i was expecting something more like a sunset magazine type presentation this book is not a how to '' manual on building an oven in fact the directions given were so poorly presented that it felt like i needed to hire these guys to do the job outlines guidelines drawings or anything else one would expect for buildiing a brick oven were completely lacking the bread portion of the book is well okay but it has been better written and done elsewhere i would pass on this book and keep lookin
first of all do n't buy this book for the recipes they seem to be included to give the feel of the period and are n't very interesting today that said there are some worthwhile passages in this book notably those that involve the author 's bipolar mother the problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with cliches the motherly housekeeper the exotic boarding school roommate the high school 'fast crowd ' the exotic college roommate the communal household one chapter in the middle is reminiscent of neal pollack 's i am friends with a black person '' minus the satire finally at the end things just begin to get interesting as the author visits french vintners in the company of kermit lynch perhaps the sequel is a better read for a far superior read try nigel slater 's toast '' it succeeds more effectively on every level and all he had to work with was british food !
i have to agree with the other reviewer in that this is a mediocre book at best it is extremely brief in its approach especially for a game as complex as this one you basically just get a map of the dungeon and a few tidbits on item locations they do n't go over what enemy parts you should break for they do n't tell you how to manipulate the sealstones there is n't anything on releasing einherjars etc save your money and wait for someone to write a good guide online
this book up to the very end was very good with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half the end is what ruins the entire thing do n't worry i 'm not going to spoil anything i 'll just say the ending stinks out loud ! this story is not really horror its sifi a it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough the writting was dead on as always and character development was good this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book
the key in the book is how to find your mission in life well after reading this thing several times i found it as unhelpful as the first read quite honestly it is full of feel good platitudes which are not only christian and no roadmap if you really want to find your mission perhaps try the other book parachute the 2007 edition is superb
having read and enjoyed the author 's young adult book hoot and looking for a light adult read i picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light frankly it was both of thos things but within a hundred pages it became eminently easy to put down i enoy a diversion reading book periodically and have some adult writers that meet those needs thomas perry and harold adams to name two this one did n't make it for me it seemed to be a lot of given a hurricane one darn thing after another for a group of characters i did n't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together
after reading several books about the founding fathers and other presidents i was excited to read about teddy now in most books they discuss personalities events and impacts of decisions this book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language there are lines that were shown as dialogue when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence he writes about facial expressions during conversations morris even wrote about what they thought during events most writers would state he would recall later '' if i had wanted to read a novel i would have i was disappointed not with the subject just the way it was written
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers there are so many open ends in the story chartacters are not distinctly outlined tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
i truly believe all of the ideas in the book are junk food for a moment
this is supposed to be the '' bible on access and it is it has everything there 's to know but if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done do n't buy this book this book as well as other bibles '' series are design with a whole cd program with sample exercises if you go thru them step by step you 'll learn your stuff but if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly you will find that their explanation is exactly as the help function on the software and then they will give you an example from that cd program believe me if you do n't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis this book wo n't do it the same applies to the excell
the book helps me to reorganize '' all the information that i have learned before word excel a few tables are informative but almost the 80 of the content are not helpful such as guiding you through step by step on how to make things work if you are an advanced microsoft office user such as you are advanced in excel or word you might most probably thinking this book is useless i skipped most of it and i am so tired of reading this book simply because i need to pay an extra affort to filter out the things i knew too wordy and the instructions are not clear when guiding you through not worth to spend your money on it
do n't waste your money on this book is just an outline of possible available avenues for securing capital but absolutely nothing applied to my situation it 's been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust
i have a hard time understanding how one of the other reviewers believes this book hits the bullseye '' as a former employee of one of the agencies listed within this book i had numerous clients come into my office looking for free money '' they grew very angry and upset once i explained that the free money '' detailed in the book was to fund our agency the money was not available directly to individuals i have written business plans and grant proposals and done research on various industries rarely is there free money '' the only exception i have seen is in agriculture and rural and it 's not just handed out the grant process can be long and very time consuming but well worth it depending on the project
i was tempted to be stupid and buy an updated version of one of his books the older bigger one i had ordered from a home shopping network about ago from the reviews i see it 's the same story the phone numbers are out of service or have new people answering them for different places you know you always want to believe help is possible unfortunately it is n't though from him as he 's only helping himself to your money
this book was a waste of time and money i spent hours going through it looking for funding options to no avail glorified phonebook with outdated information save your money !
i found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop ! what i did find interesting is that vickie seems to review all of matthew lesko 's books of course vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as kudos to matthew lesko ! he 's making this a better place ! '' for those of you who are a little slow let me inform you that vickie is really matthew lesko or someone matthew gave this review to and paid vickie to post it it 's strange that vickie 's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout it is also strange that vickie only reviews matthew 's books shame on you matthew lesko for writing your own review
this book is totally useless i 've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail this will not help you make money and does not lead to any free '' money anywhere keep the money you have
this is the story of sheriff bell an insufferable dullard who wo n't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up he 's also a boaster never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife loretta is the same loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals which tells me all i need to know about that marriage the does n't stop there an even bigger is chigurh the murderer in fact he kills people twice before he shoots 'em he bores 'em to death his weapon of choice lectures about coins his final kill took so long i had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage on the technical front mccarthy does not structure the drama in the classical way he chose the boring way the majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character moss has a believable goal mccarthy also omits the obligatory final scene between chigurh and his prey moss which was the only reason i kept reading the book no doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story in my case what 's more sheriff bell has no scenes with either chigurh or moss making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action because mccarthy writes good visual dialogue he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story but when the man on the run moss exits the story there is no other character to invest in so the plot grinds to a halt mccarthy can not resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players so does mccarthy put us out of our misery no sheriff bell waffles on for pages and pages about vietnam not unlike john goodman 's character walter in the big lebowski and that 's it my verdict i hope loretta runs away with a criminal preferably one of them new evil ones
very little plot which is boring the reader should be paid by the page if not by the word to read this book !
i thought i was going to get a thriller when i first heard of this instead i got a to cold mountain set in 1980 texas and i have rather low opinions of cold mountain it was difficult to follow the story due to mccarthy 's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue a move i 've always considered to be a pretentious affectation but also commas apostrophes and proper spelling such as not capitalizing english '' or using livingroom '' instead of living room '' and mam '' instead of ma'am '' i do n't know if this is something mccarthy does in all his books or this was a deal but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable i also did n't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of sheriff bell at the beginning of each as he tended to ramble on about life after world war two and how it was n't uncommon to see as ordained ministers or as sheriffs of counties the size of delaware hopefully its movie adaptation which i legitimately pity the coen brothers for having to wade through is more accessible
dear sean thanks for sending me your book deliver us from evil defeating terrorism despotism and liberalism '' before i put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep i just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me let me get this straight you 'd like to see all liberals vanish from the face of the american political system and have only conservative republicans running the show is that right hmm let me see if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system there was the soviet union fascist italy nazi germany those are three just off the top of my head they did n't like liberalism either well sean i got to get going i 'm sure i 'll write again soon all my best bill ps remember fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced
now that hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation thank god for hannity ! '' krock founder of nambl
i just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece 's meeting with sean but first the review in order not to diminish the previous reviews i will just focus on the whole war talk on page 4 no messing around here sean states w e must take the war to them rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood '' wow bring it on dude oh you mean let 's send somebody else 's kid to fight right on page 247 he drills that point in with i 'd like to see the good governor dean present a case that there 's any higher moral cause than defending one 's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack '' if it 's such a great moral cause '' sean why oh why ai n't you out there with the rest of my family does this by the way mean you are immoral since you punked out i never thought of myself as moral '' just because i volunteered and served as a paratrooper in vietnam is military service only for democrats and brown people should we have a new draft catagory such as '' for republican '' which means you do n't have to serve to paraphrase frank purdue it takes a tender man to spout tough talk page 108 puts down democrats i 'm a democrat who served in vietnam or am i repeating myself with w hen it comes to the hitlers the brezhnevs the saddams pussyfooting is the order of the day '' yeah sean tell me what you really think well sean some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you do and was n't the bush family in business with hitler during wwii here is really why this guy is full of himself my niece visiting me before heading to the gulf and her first combat tour spotted him in dc she introduced herself and told him she was a fan when she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book saying he would ship it to her she is very polite and told him he did n't have to sean insisted she wrote her address down before heading overseas i asked her if sean had sent the book as promised no and no surprise for me so me being me i contacted sean by email twice but got not reply too busy impressing all those other servicewomen i guess sean hannity not just by this book but by his actions is a coward blowhard and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen his book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book you should be ashamed of yourself sean but that would mean taking a moral '' position would n't it
sean hannity 's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country especially when their audience consists of organ banks hannity is stupid hypocritical and loud his sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for exchange hannity is well dressed and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the hannity and combs report this bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small get a real job you poser
hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on fox news time after time move over oreilly
not much new here you would be hardpressed to get any benefit from this book it does n't grab the atttention of the reader
this book should be used for firewood god knows the trees suffered enough
i gave this book 1 star because i was so offended as a christian i have to admit i am an evangelical christian who had never heard of hugh hewitt until i found this book in the bin at a christian bookstore after reading it i truly wondered where the moral outrage of christians has gone this is pure machiavellian politics that has nothing to do with anything in christ 's gospel sure there are moral absolutes but for christians to associate themselves with this kind of xenophobic racist and unscriptural totalitarianism is at the very least as much an affront to the cross of christ as anything in the gay agenda '' i am embarrassed and personally truly repentant that a book like this even carries the imprint of a christian publisher i would also like to apologize to anyone who might assume that this is a christian view of the world the jesus of the bible who is my savior and messiah does not fear either terrorists or multiculturists but gave his life for them only asking that they go and sin no more '' and make disciples of all men '' it is the whitewashed tombs '' of pharisaical hyporites that he condemns we can only pray that the kind of america hewitt envisions never comes about or if it does that we face the inquisition as good and faithful servants ''
hugh 's book is a disappointment it seems like a rush job thrown together to peddle during the election not much scholarship was done either for example he asserts that when gore tried to block overseas military ballots from being counted not a single democrat raised their voice in opposition he must not have done a search because gore supporter zell miller was very vocal in opposing the effort to block military votes further very little was done to cite specific situations of democrat party vote the way hugh segments the parties into pyramids and his description of the interplay between segments was useful but did not merit a hardcover book purchase various bush speeches re have been attached at the back for reference perhaps to boost the page count i like hugh and i love his radio show but hugh has a fairly cerebral audience and this book was more appropriate for sean hannity groupies
the thing that hewitt wants most is to lead this country down the path of fascism do n't join him would recommend staying away from these people read something intelligent like chomsky
man abuses our environment there now you dont have to sit throug 400 pages of ranting about how statistics are proving we destroy our environment if you need this book to realize we are a destructive race well then maybe you should read it its so repetative you are bound to get the idea
valuable as a reference work do n't read it for pleasure or relaxatio
i was disappointed with this book it was good as far as it went but it seemed to be very choppy and did n't answer questions that i felt would be present in anyone 's mind who was reading the book perhaps his book gives more details about his ability to heal how he handles this ability what challenges he faces etc also because almost no names or other information was given this book had a feeling of made up '' to it i would like to think that is n't the case but i wonder why someone would write a book about their gifts and yet hide their names and any information about themselves what is their real reason for writing it
very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors
if you believe this baloney then i have a bridge i 'd like to sell you
half of these stories i have read before and the other half i did not like everything in this book is pointless first of all sedaris ' name in big letters on the cover why because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection the reason the book is published to benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about well i am giving two stars and not one just because i liked the color of the cover kind of greenish salad color
i failed to realize that this was a book edited '' by as opposed to written by '' david sedaris until his introduction incidentally the introduction was the only portion of the book that i actually enjoyed his analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song i do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes i do not think they were bad stories actually i would like to take that back if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad it was however impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the gre vocabulary words in one short story i will not stop buying the books that david sedaris authors i will just be more careful david sedaris is a brilliant he may not capture all or even any of the elements of a good '' short story i would not know an element of a good short story if i ran into one coming off the elevator i do know that david sedaris ' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism i can not wait for the next book he actually writes
dull antiseptic lacking any interesting perspective at best you could say this book is like a series of colorless newspaper articles strung together at worst a book written by someone so far removed from his subject that he might as well of been writing about extraterrestials i wonder if raab has ever actually met or talked to a mafiosi face to face this book seems to get all its information from law enforcement souces prosecutorial types or other books nowhere is there any kind of sociological context that might raise the subject matter above the level of journalism and flat lifeless journailism at that for someone so accomplished and genearlly recongnized as an expert '' in his field this book is a big snooze
this book was recommended to me as an educational tool for my children no way ! i felt like the book did not address the dangers of the drugs at all in fact if anything i would want to try some of the drugs after reading about them if i did n't know better
this has to be the most boring book i have ever read well i have n't quite finished it yet as it 's taking forever to push my way through it and i 'm sure that more boring books exist i just have n't read them i wanted to learn about kkr and lbos particularly as a division of kkr recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer i was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes but this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved there really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information and a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material it felt a bit like watching someone else 's home video it probably means a lot to the people involved especially as they 'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants but it 's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness i 'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway people do n't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years what are remembered are broad brushstrokes and this is what the author should have written there are occasional moments of entertainment like ted forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds but most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting the fact is i wanted some of this information in this book as it provided some of this albeit with a lot of suffering on my part i 'll give it two stars update well i did finish this book eventually my final opinion is much the same
i bought this for two reasons because i wanted to learn about lbos and because i had heard that the journalism was good and was hoping for something like 'the right stuff ' the cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed ' writing and 'all the suspense of a thriller ' the last is true only if your expectations of a thriller reach no higher than michael crichton the writing is a plodding 'you are there ' pastiche of the new yorker gulfstreams are sleak ceos are silver maned are bantams lawyers look like they model for gq etc investment bankers bark curse are struck by inspiration work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level stan lee would scorn i finally realised after slogging through the first 200 pages or so that 'barbarians at the gate ' is in large part essentially porn for aspirational middle managers there is in this book whom i would want to know unless i were a sociologist but i do n't even trust the sociology because the psychology is so superficial i did learn something about the process of lbos and for that a star is in order i did n't particularly enjoy learning it

this book was interesting at first it shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like but that only takes a chapter after that it just keeps repeating itself over and over who do you think bought the 1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch '' yeah yeah i get it the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending no real wealth guy then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point i want real examples i do n't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity but do n't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it is n't real then there is the advice on being frugal i am pretty frugal but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if i had to live like that sure i could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget but then i would n't be very happy who cares if i have a million when i 'm if i had to live miserably up until then what is that worth i know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car but driving around my 20 year old jeep is no fun either ! this book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender people with common sense need not buy this book just check it out at the library like i did
i was looking forward to using what i learned from this book to implement balanced scorecard strategy with my small business clients there is so little useful information i did n't even finish reading the book the last chapter and appendix are literally the only portions i found helpful look elsewhere
the book rehashes the article for an extra couple hundred pages i 've got this book on the shelf but when i want to talk about the balanced score card concept i go back to the article
having read the millionaire next door '' as well as most if not all of the classics in this category i expected experiences with this book there were too many statistics and statistics that contradicted one another not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that try as i did i had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop then because the cover art is great i decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece
this is a deeply flawed book it purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy but it is based mostly on their without comparison to a control group i suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success and attributes causation where there is only correlation further the author displays clear biases on a number of topics which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires on pp the author looks at success factors and compares to the role of luck on pp which he downplays in favor of discipline while he touches on the importance of having the right connections and the genetic contributions to intelligence on 85 he asks what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school what does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice very little according to these physicians '' but what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood let alone be able to attend a medical school quite a bit unlike its predecessor which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth paws of wealth uaws this book focuses on millionaires paws and decamillionaires a tiny subset of paws those with net worth or greater the lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book 's value a misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp makes the point stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth but this comparison is misleading because he 's only looking at the sample he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers the average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers if he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers for example the problem is more obvious by excluding all those who are n't worth or more up front you exclude the vast majority and pull up the average with stockbrokers on the other hand a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy on 110 after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising never lie never tell one lie '' 55 he passes right over his example warren lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job without comment and without noticing the hypocrisy on pp the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray he repeats this again on 370 saying nearly of the millionaires 47 percent engaged in prayer for a significant percentage of millionaires their religious faith is a major force in their lives '' in trying to emphasize the point 174 he splits his sample into religious millionaires '' rm and other millionaires '' om observes that 75 of rm engage in prayer while only 8 of om do and points out that this is a ratio of more than nine to one '' this is a meaningless comparison however rm make up only 37 of his total population of millionaires so his more than nine to one '' ratio is really nothing more than saying of those millionaires who are religious hold religious practices which involve regular prayer and 8 of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway since the om population is much larger than the rm population in absolute numbers that 's not a ratio his numbers show that about 28 of his total sample are rm who pray while 5 of his total sample are om who pray closer to a ratio but more importantly the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious even a quarter of those who are do n't engage in regular prayer ! given that the is one of the most religious countries in the world the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause but for stanley religion and prayer are an important foundation of the millionaire mind '' and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population in a later table in the book on 366 he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days the table includes 52 attending religious services 47 praying 37 attending religious events 22 reading these numbers do n't quite match up with the data from pp which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population and weekly church attendance is notoriously in surveys work by mark chaves kirk hardaway and marler in the found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show this actually could mean that millionaires attend more often if stanley 's survey results do n't have similar the author 's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she despite not being a church attendee search for a mate by joining a church group 268 because she believed in marriage and the traditional family concept '' he writes that i believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars of course there are no guarantees but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the good book '' but why is he just guessing on this has n't he asked his population of millionaires the ones who are 63 how they met their mates he did this very usefully regarding how millionaires purchase their homes pp yet is n't picking a partner even more important this book has some interesting data and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations the characteristics of economically productive millionaires productive millionaires in chapter 7 but it does n't stand up well in comparison to the millionaire next door which is a much better book
having read frank 's what 's the matter with kansas '' i quite liked started this book i looked forward to reading a critique of the emperor 's new economic paradigm '' that the almighty is the answer to all of america 's problems however after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages i cried uncle '' frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum and to add injury to insult the book 's tiny font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses
i listened to this as an audiobook this is the worst book i 've ever listened to from audible the worst the narration is just too too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best unfortunately i keep hearing emperor franz josef in amadeus saying it has well too many notes '' barr describes everything including clothes hair shoes etc with multiple metaphors a plethora of adjectives and well too many notes i kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story i tried three times to listen to it and just wanted to scream after 10 minutes i 've heard this woman read other books and quite liked them but her voice and this story just do n't add up to anything other than ear pain and a case of diabetes where 's michael connelly when you need him
as a former park concession employee i rolled my eyes virtually every time i turned the pages of this book and yes i turned them and kept going kept hoping things would get more logical concession employees with huge boxes of makeup do n't make best friends with nps backcountry rangers concession employees do n't even act like the nps exists and vice versa climbers would n't put up with californians driving in their suvs can anyone say or better and as awful as the assistant superintendent is yosemite is famous for its law enforcement folks who would be all over a quadruple disappearance i ca n't see even a drunkard law dog ignoring anna 's repeated pleas for help lastly nevada based the crux of the mystery on a actual incident just as she did her mystery in glacier seems a little convenient to me where 's the creativity in that having said all that the thing that rang absolutely true was the pecking order of the nps and the concessioner in which a waitress would seem slightly by real '' park rangers not fair but that is how it is and this is why i keep reading nevada 's stuff and giggling even with its flaws
i am a nevada barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with high country '' the story takes place in a restaurant boring the characters were dull and i kept getting them confused anna 's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome i also missed anna 's sister molly who is only mentioned a few times in the book sorry but i really ca n't recommend this book as a good read if you want to get a feel for a real anna pigeon adventure pick up track of the cat '' or liberty falling
the q a approach adopted in this book is very useful it would provide for a very useful reference manual on m a if its content were not so dated its discussion of taxes accounting and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and m a practices it would be helpful if the author would update the material other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that i have found useful include mergers acquisitions and other restructuring activities by depamphilis and bruner 's m a book
virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company 's they just describe them differently there is nothing new my other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda and talk about ego his family friends and other business initiatives are promoted in the book and most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned if it 's going to be an autobiography tell us so i should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses and speaking of business success a share of stock in jan 1994 around the time bakke became ceo was trading at an adjusted 5 per share seven years later in december of 2002 the year bakke retired the share price was 3.02 no thanks i 'll put my money in ge need i say more look i 'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but i do not think this is a credible book
i have a problem with bakke 's idea of fun '' fun by his definition is a for example he feels that an organization 's amount of fun '' is determined by the number of individuals allowed to make decisions '' 99 i agree that sharing information reinforces the feeling of community '' 98 but i do n't agree with his suggestion that leaders should ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision '' 88 sharing information '' and seeking advice '' are two different things bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate 103 it is the subordinate who should trust the leader in one section of the book he stresses the importance of asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision '' but in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget but no higher approval is necessary '' apparently no other advice is needed as well 79 his idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing to others in his postscript bakke discusses biblical leadership at first glance what he writes sounds '' serve the people they lead '' and allow followers to use their talents effectively '' 261 but his overall idea of leadership is not biblical for instance he says the creation story does not assign people even leaders the responsibility of ' other people '' 261 i wonder what he thought god meant in genesis when he told eve he will be your master '' the bible does n't use the word manage '' but god entrusted leaders to people throughout the 's why there were judges in the ot i do n't think the israelites would 've left the wilderness if moses asked as many as possible '' before making a decision
it took me dungeon master 's guide ii to find out that i had bought too many d d books already i am used to flipping through a d d book and sorting things that i like and might be useful from things that are a waste of space i did n't find anything useful in this book if you 're an experienced dm you wo n't either here 's why chapter 1 running a game provides you with tips on how to deal with different kinds of players and different tastes for games the approach is almost therapeutic and deals with communication issues on the game table chapter 2 adventures has more new traps some tips on using published material and rules for aerial battles crowds mobs to save you from the effort of coming up with them yourself chapter 3 the campaing has tips about preparing a campaign that 's where my biggest disappointment is at the session on how to create towns it has very few numerical statistics it basically lists what kind of professionals and shops you 'll find in a city chapter 4 saltmarsh describes the city of saltmarsh pretty generic chapter 5 non player characters have a lot of multiclass npcs as if they were hard to create and a list of powers to make npcs unique but unfortunately they have no rules to use them in pcs chapter 6 characters has rules on apprenticeship and masters that is actually nice and general guidelines nothing numerical on designing custom prestige classes chapter 7 magic items has actually no new magic items ! just a new approach to old ones novice dms may find it actually quite useful and inspiring so may lazy dms if you 're used to running campaigns and using your own material in your game you 'll find this book nothing more than a collection of nice illustrations and things you already know
this book is just a argument for why all businesses should outsource every situation in the book is just a setup for the ceo to confront reality '' and outsource their business advice which can be fatal to many companies outsourcing is only appropriate in a few circumstances and the reality is that outsourcing may have outlived its usefulness time for bossidy to confront reality and do what is right creating opportunities for american business in america
execution '' was as interesting as this one is useless do n't buy it is only blablabla ! as always in movies sequels are not as good as the original however i highly recommend their first book execution the discipline of getting things done ''
i find it rather humorous that bossidy would write a book with this title it was bossidy 's decision to hire ray gimlartin as chairman of merck a decision which most analysts seriously questioned the disastrous outcomes of that decision are still being played out it took years for bossidy to confront reality and do the right thing by finally acknowledging his mistake and replacing gilmartin even then as the company was sinking fast he kept gilmartin in an advisory capacity with a salary most people can only dream of now he intends to share with others his wisdom regarding confronting reality '' if anything bossidy 's latest work is a classic case of do as i say not as i do ''
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the in a row preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and ugh and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom ' mentality in the end i think if a person is from a household respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too even ones personality and this book does n't send a message about love as much as 'i own you ' i like 'mama do you love me ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love moon ' by margaret wise brown however is by far my children 's all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly 'normal ' family take it grain of salt
the book is a big disappointment i picked this book because i had bought the first version few years back and looked for an upgrade it turns out to be a new book from content style to author for instance the 'template tools ' chapter is just a recite of the man pages accompanied with poor examples and explanation is less than helpful
this book is utter trash you will derive more benefit from reading learning perl edition and programming perl this book offers nothing in terms of delving into the operational guts of perl its philosophy its parser and guts in general the first edition was far and away better although siriviam did not explain the concepts behind 'my ' and 'local ' in its proper origins but that is irrelevent in terms of comparing the edition with the first the edition is nothing more than volume 2 to learning perl if you want to become a proficient and professional perl programmer do not waste your money on the edition get your hands on the first edition and hold on to it until a better alternative comes along
this book as has been said is a completely different book and not worthy of being called the second edition of such a good book '' oreilly has dissapointed me for the first time since most oreilly perl books are excellent value and of a high quality instead as in the first edition that covers a good range of advanced topics this book chooses some rare and obscure ones this book is of little use to the programmer whom has ever picked up the cook book or perl programming by same publisher unfortunely for me i did not have the chance to see the book in person or a truthful review
this is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter the suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out the suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big duh and then group like items together duh that 's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system oh is that affordable if i had to redo my kitchen i would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins come on do n't waste your money on this book or it 's suggestions very few pictures and all for the rich i thought good housekeeping was for the everyday family get it at the library and then return it after you do n't read it

this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention keep you enthralled and refuse to let you stop reading i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is but it 's because how good everything is until the very end that 's right the incredible of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel this is deus ex machina '' in its finest form this is unexcusable in my opinion i just do n't get it i just do n't understand how one can seemingly work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages i gave it two stars as opposed to one for fooling everyone into reading through this book this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
it 's probably been 15 years since i read it and every person in the years since with whom i have discussed this book has said the same thing it was literally a book that kept me up until 3 and that is how it ends i 'm hoping crichton had a publishing deadline or something
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be
this 1987 thriller focuses on norman johnson a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes as the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the us navy johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the south pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft he was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration an assignment that johnson would just as soon forget once the team is taken to the navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances that the navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology labels and directions are even written in english leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is the suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile this novel is quite predictable just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby that the undersea environment will become threatening there will be many deaths there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on while there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment crichton is capable of so much more if you are a fan read it but be forewarned if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this
this just in william burroughs was the only beat writer with any talent at all and ironically if you were to ask your average college type for the names of beat writers burroughs would n't even come to their mind allan disgustingberg alias allan was a very successful literary fraud he was even able to blindside burroughs who was a literary genius into thinking he was a real hairway to steven er stairway to heaven and this is most astonishing since if you 've ever seen a picture of allan disgustingberg you know that he was about as sexy as my uncle abe
the pages in this book are unevenly cut customer support tells me that the publisher did this intentionally it 's incredibly annoying to read difficult to get to the right page and it just does n't feel right in my hands parker 's work is of course exceptional but find a copy of the old edition and steer clear of this one
if you are an experienced programmer and already familiar with design patterns refactoring and application architecture then you will probably find this book to be very frustrating the author seems to be on a crusade to rid the world of bad coding practices and though i fully salute his efforts i think this book is horribly a more appropriate title would have been principles of web architecture and design and a few words about ajax '' all i wanted was to learn the mechanics of ajax and after reading the first 100 pages and getting nothing new out of it i felt like my time had been robbed
warning before reading this book make sure you are well schooled in the soviet invasion of afghanistan us involvement with somalia the persian gulf war and islam the more you know about these subjects the more you will realize that bergen interjects his political opinions throughout the book with side comments by selectively adding some facts and leaving out others and by the clever arrangements of facts bergen is biased against the us and eerily the net affect is some sort of weird admiration for obl bergen falls for some of obl 's twisted misrepresentation of the koran see page 99 and note the bergen 's equalization of the words infidel and idolater he also defends obl 's rants against the us by clarifying for the reader that un sanctions killed iraqi children of course bergen leaves out saddam hussein 's role in starving his own people bergen 's account of the murder of abdullah azzam bergen calls him obl 's mentor follows right after discussion with former pakistani prime minister so this arrangement implies that somehow they are connected other scholars suspect obl of murdering azzam this bergen ignores in his discussion of the soviet invasion of afghanistan he spends all his time talking from the side of the rebels he gives no background as to events leading up to it nor the poor military practices in the soviet army which contributed to its own defeat the soviet union published an after action review the bear went over the mountain that points out individual combat leaders and mistakes they made that were grievous enough so that any band of rebels could have beaten them bergen only presents obl view that he brought down a super power he does mention the us made stinger missile but spends more time talking about how clumsy the us was to let some of these go unaccounted for rather than mentioning that without the stinger the soviets would not have pulled out in chapter 4 he mentions desert storm and out of left field adds the fact the timothy mcveigh was one of the us troops there he adds that before ok city was the worst terrorist activity in us the subliminal message is us army is an equivalent terrorist organization as later he outright says training in an camp is better that basic training in the army in discussing somalia he makes sure the reader is aware george h bush got us involved he leaves out background information about the un and boutris boutris ghali role in tribal conflict he claims at least 500 '' somalis died when more respected accounts put the number at 3000. he says us tried '' to capture and never mention they did capture two bad guys in all he makes the us look foolish and 's cause of serious blow against us he does n't mention the decision by les aspin to hamper the mission by denying the us its own vehicles while recounting obl 's case against the us like the reader is suppose to take this seriously he adds his opinion that for two thousand years christians do n't follow the teachings of jesus i 'm not half way through the book and i 'm sorry i bought it i was hoping for a documented history about obl instead i got the cnn view of the world obl is a deeply religious man a great military leader a successful businessman and has a legitimate case against the us which by default is guilty
i was given three months to read this book and each time i picked it up i threw it down in disgust between the johnny appleseed referances to the collegian 's guide to growing pot it is amazing i got through it i am convinced he was once a columbian drug lord
it 's the polar opposite of good writing it 's so familiar so conversational so unturgid and so padded with fluffy stuff it 's unreadable even worse than i figured it would be oh well now i know after wondering all these years
overall i felt that this book could have been and should have been much better the level of debt is a real problem as are the abuses of lenders but the author 's perception and description of the problem is often off and the proposed solutions are inadequate the author offers a morality play in which the merchants of greed victimize both the poor and the middle class while convincing users of convenience to think of themselves as more virtuous than the even though their perks come at the expense of the less fortunate no doubt our ancestors would be horrified to watch us incur debt to buy a pair of shoes fill the gas tank or buy a restaurant meal but their horror would come from not from morality but from fear in their time mortgaging the farm often led to its loss and mortgaging one 's future income might lead to the poorhouse today there is a balance which the author does not acknowledge between easy credit which leads some users to max out '' and restricted credit which prevents most people from obtaining a credit card speaking as one who lived for years on a near salary i 'd have to say that it was to my benefit to obtain a card because 1 although i could not afford to own a car i could occasionally afford to rent one and 2 the internet functions somewhat as sears did 100 years ago in that if the local merchants charge too much one has a ready alternative in this author 's morality play credit merchants appear as the and the devil 's voice is advertising thus welfare moms obtain bedroom sets they ca n't afford from because it 's hard not to succumb to the industry 's aggressive marketing campaigns '' but we 're talking about adults and there are alternatives i did not buy entertainment products i could not afford and when i could afford them but local merchants charged too much i ordered through the mail or for more portable items took a bus to a discount store for furniture i bought from a salvation army thrift store and hired a truck to take it home the point is not that i was more virtuous than a rac customer but 1 some people 's lives are just too chaotic to plan more than a week or two ahead and for these everything must be bought on credit because saving is impossible and 2 have it now '' and it must be new '' are very important values to rac 's customers government regulation can not address either regulation the author 's prime solution can curb some of the worst abuses for example gaming commissions can forbid casino operators from locating atms inside the casino payday lenders can be forbidden to roll over loans more than three times credit card lenders can be required to set higher minimum payments to shorten payback time nonetheless market forces and the creativity of lenders and merchants will defeat most regulation for example native american casinos can evade most state regulation and the high price of credit is easily hidden in the price or rent of consumer goods indeed was largely invented to evade state usury laws short of a government bureaucracy to establish maximum prices and rents for everything what exactly would he do about this the author describes real problems but his insistence on seeing credit card america '' primarily as a morality play limits both his vision and his range of possible solutions and remediations
the basic thesis of this book in case you need to be told is that evil credit card companies are fleecing america and getting away with it and that those revolvers '' who carry interest from month to month on their credit cards are well idiots alas after having waded through the whole of the book i would not recommend it to others even those who are passionate about the issue while the material is and the author seems incapable of making his subject matter come alive or writing efficiently or effectively the whole performance is more or less forgettable sure it 's an important issue but after the first twenty pages or so you pretty much get it '' and all the anecdotes and graphs after that are essentially superfluous manning furthermore certainly has a bone to pick and while agree with pretty much his entire position i could n't help feeling this makes him less than trustworthy to wit subscribing as he obviously does to the puritan notions of saving the shame of bankruptcy he reveals nothing but disdain for the outrageous way the world seems to work these days in the end i felt this book was much more effective as a lament for the lost virtue of prudence rather than a sober analysis of the consequences of america 's addiction to credit '' nearly all of his case histories '' for example are negative was ruined by his improvident use of plastic recklessly lived for the moment but what manning or even ignores are the many cases in which credit cards frequently allow members of the underclass to travel complete their education change jobs extricate themselves from some unforeseen difficulty and then pay dearly for it later or perhaps even chapter 10 it away no all of that stuff is shunted aside in favor of focusing on how disgraceful everybody 's behavior is in summation not as with insights and interesting facts as i thought it would be further what facts '' the book does have to offer unfortunately are so unremarkable and tendentious that they could probably be sketched out at least in their general thrust by one who has simply been apprised of the author 's stance without actually having read the book himself
republicans lose an election and what do they do they go right back to the stupid practices that got them kicked out of office yes republicans have gone back to talking about god taking the moral high ground against the secular evil left '' never mind illegal immigration the trade policies which forfeit our national sovereignty never mind america 's loss of credibility and allies in the world my republican party has abondoned its core principles espoused by barry goldwater which focused on a smaller role for government national sovereignty and fiscal responsibility speaking as a republican it looks like my party is bound and determined to stay the minority party forever and to become a willing accompliss in putting hillary in the white house
this propaganda is by a guy who tried to impeach clinton while he himself had an affair on top of that gingrich tried to pass a bill that would give the death penalty to pot smokers people who brought 40 grams of weed with them over the border talk about crazy this guy should n't be in politics he should be in a siberian labor camp he like all christian fundamentalists should just take his bible and his 'lord baby jesus ' and shove it deep up his because the rest of the country really does n't want to hear the bells of theocracy anymore do we really want to put our nation in the hands of this antiquated nihilistic jesus myth i think not again this is n't the 'united states of lord baby jesus ' and we as a nation should do everything in our power to prevent it from becoming so it 's also important to realize that our founding fathers were not christian they were deists which is akin to today 's agnosticism george washington 's practice of christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a christian he repeatedly declined the church 's sacraments never did he take communion and when his wife martha did he waited for her outside the sanctuary even on his deathbed washington asked for no ritual uttered no prayer to christ and expressed no wish to be attended by his representative here are some of the many quotes by our founding fathers john adams this would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it '' the divinity of jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity nowhere in the gospels do we find a precept for creeds confessions oaths doctrines and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in christianity '' thomas jefferson i do not find in orthodox christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology '' christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law '' benjamin franklin lighthouses are more helpful than churches '' the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason '' i looked around for god 's judgments but saw no signs of them '' in the affairs of the world men are saved not by faith but by the lack of it '' thomas paine i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all '' all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit '' the study of theology as it stands in the christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authority it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of no conclusion '' save yourself the money and do the research yourself the proper role of a government is to remain agnostic and remember our founding fathers did not believe in jesus
if you are a man you will not like this collection of feminist essays this book is worse than bad it is an abomination
if you like neurotic women who never know how to gain control of their lives this book is for you if not just pass this by i know she won all kinds of awards from her other books but this is full of whining and in fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine i could n't even get past the first section and i 'm a huge reader
this is another in a long history of books written by blind men describing the elephant 's trunk other great books and essays in this tradition include free to choose '' by milton and rose friedman the law '' by frederick bastiat and economics in one lesson '' by henry hazlitt all these books are quite good at describing the trunk or a tree but miss the elephant or the woods in the process for what it covers it is a fine book however sowell forgets to apply all of his principles to the most influential business organization in the market the corporation the corporation has the perpetual life limited liability and personhood the qualities of limited liability and personhood could not be reproduced without government intervention in the market yet limited liability and personhood are ignored so that he can focus on rent control or price controls are rent controls really more important to the economy than a corporation before the libertarians and conservatives that are reading this get their bunched over a corporation being able to be created without government intervention think about a third party being hurt by a corporate action if a corporation mistakenly dumps toxic waste on land that you own then goes out of business who is responsible answer no one you made no contract with the offending corporation neither explicitly nor implicitly you are left paying for the mistake that others made because the government granted limited liability or limited irresponsibility to corporate investors is limited liability so trivial that it can be ignored if yes then let 's get rid if it no more limited liability if no why does n't sowell explore the unintended consequences of this government intervention i suggest you take sowell 's advice and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of corporate limited liability and personhood now that could make a good book does limited liability change incentives does the gathering of capital through limited liability have an impact on political campaigns and lobbying and through lobbying changes in the law this book is just more stuff on a pile of stuff that was better written
you can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband all she wants to know is did he love her when he married her why did he do it i mean give me a break ! i would not lay low and try to make him go insane i would go to the police i read books from beginning to end to give them a chance this was a waste of my time
i bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding i find it dificult to follow yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down !
the first nora roberts novel i read was northern lights and i was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale interesting and believable characters and a and exciting plot angels fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller this time the hick town location is cliched and dull as are the characters especially the heroine i started this book on a plane trip and put it down after a couple hours a month later i 'm still only half way through it in the last ten chapters not much has happened
hmm quite a disappointment especially after splurging on the hardcover edition set as a kind of rockies rear window '' this is one slow story endless pages of when i 'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through finally skipped ahead to finish the book i had really looked forward to angels fall too if you are a roberts fan do n't spend the money on the hardcover wait for the paperback go to the library or borrow from a friend not worth the price
how good was this book i do n't even remember the story line i know i read the book and past it along to a friend but it sure was n't memoriable sorry folks your not going to get a rave from me
i have little to add to what 's already been said by other reviewers other than i ca n't believe she seriously holds these views i admit that i only read parts of the book while at the bookstore but no one who is educated and i presume she is can really think that evolution is unproven you might as well say that the earth is flat or square or whatever she writes this drivel because it targets the and gives them what they want apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year
ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality to her there is no middle ground i am an educated well travelled adult who while born in the united states spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded to be called a communist a traitor and an enemy of america just because i do n't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on i have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it 's evil until i read this one be afraid be very afraid of these people
culturally illiterate bigots should n't publish books like this it 's a waste of otherwise useful paper if i were a conservative '' which i 'm not i 'd be profoundly embarassed to have ann coulter claming to speak for me she 's an insult to thoughful conservatives everywhere
my wife and i were really dissappointed in this book we finally gave up after the first chapter she rambles on and on she uses a lot of words and terms that the average reader wo n't know if you have ever heard her speak on tv then you know what the book is like she talks fast and that is conveyed into the book what is really sad is that she curses in it for being a christian '' she uses a lot of bad words we do not recommend this book at all
this book was too predicatable i could see the plot coming miles ahead a big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops and he does n't even have a gun all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain you knew goldie would turn out to be a hooker and if that 's a spoiler for you you need to read more fiction watch more sopa operas the characters are n't that complex rather and to make matters worse miller does n't even give a twist in the plot for the record there have been a number of people who claim to work for god that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes the crusades for one so miller you do n't get any points from me on that one now for those of you that are saying hey it 's only a comic book a big one but a comic nonetheless '' i say that is bulll ! ! '' read watchmen the judas contract future imperfect and the league part one and two oh and elfquest and then tell me if a comic book ca n't be well this no story piece of crap
you may want a home business for a second income or maybe a whole career change there are thousands of options for earning a living now i started in 2004 and this is a book i read in preparation it was useful for an over 40 woman like me there is so much info around it 's hard to filter through it in the end my own website has become a place to review the latest home based business ideas thanks to priscilla for the initial ideas
this book stinks it 's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information pass if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money
verbose annoyingly pedantic and rarely to the point this text is a disaster from start to finish for students who have little to no research experience it will be overwhelming in detail unless you find reading formal style manuals to be a joy on the contrary for the more seasoned researcher certain sections will likely appear dubious or downright wrong insofar as the text has a strong bias towards a certain social scientific approach which is subject to learned academic debate a point students should be made aware of it essentially presents the research process as take it or leave it encouraging a investigative framework that leads to inevitably trite conclusions additionally it reads like a car manual with many sections repeated verbatim when the need arises for them to be referenced a second time finally it uses examples of students work that are of questionable quality as positive examples rather than well written notable published pieces in conclusion this would never be an appropriate guide for a students at elite research universities nor would it be an efficient approach for students at less vaunted programs
i 've heard everyone go on and on about how wonderful clare naylor is and i was hoping to be entertained yeah well i was n't liv 's fianc dumps her and to heal herself she takes time off her job and goes to stay with a friend who 's living in a 's house in sydney australia where she has amazing adventures with gay men and single guys who want nothing more than a shag same ol ' same ol ' she meets up with her very first love ben parker who is dating the girl everyone wants amelia fraser he starts to fancy liv who then follows the advice of her gay friend james to treat men like dogs and they 'll always be begging for more throw in the prerequisite chick lit twists and voil the story there was a lot going on at once in this story and it made me weary reading it i did n't even really look forward to reading it that much once i got into it but i was n't going to waste all that valuable reading time so i slogged through i 've read better
this is a repeat of the first 2 books for the most part i do understand that the rich dad classics '' are n't meant for tips and specific methods of making money but rather a rich mindset mineset but any specifics no they are his best kept secrets you would have to attend his money making seminars spend more money it 's understandable to emphasize the importance of mindset in a book or two and i did really enjoy the original rich dad poor dad '' but it seems like all of his books are just about the mindset what good is a mindset if there is no real direction in executing it do n't waste your time reading this book it 's also the thickest of the three if you have n't already done so however read the original rich dad poor dad
i am not a fan of robert kiyosaki i find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense while he introduces some worthwhile ideas i do n't think he develops them enough to be useful i also do n't like the tone or context out of which this writer expresses himself i find that it comes across as unfeeling manipulative and selfish i do n't have anything against seeking out wealth however i think the means to that end is important in my opinion this author ignores that important fact and at the same time does not supply the detail that people are looking for or need to achieve their financial goals in short i think this book is a waste of money there are many other books that can give you more useful information in less space which is delivered from a more humane emotional space
i refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer did n't really write this i will try to describe him or her definitely a vegetarian possibly a member of peta dry writing style well crighton is dry even when he 's excellent it bothers me how many unrealistic characters crichton uses it seems every character in some of these books earned a phd from mit by 16 was an alternate on the olympic swim team a top researcher an accomplished pilot beautiful or handsome and wealthy these people do not exist in nature they also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete complex sentences quoting research in casual conversation but at least mc has a gift for crafting believable plausible much like isaac asimov but this is so beneath him i refuse to accept it
when professor polk describes the sweep of history in iraq he is at his best but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts much of the political ranting is supposition marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work the ranting gets especially tedious towards the end my advice read the first part and skip the last half
i was very excited about this book before i started to read it polk appeared to have flawless credentials surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on iraq unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met let 's start witht the obvious the subtitle of this book begins as the whole sweep of iraqi history '' the book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving physically the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average to be sure no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of iraqi history but of all the iraqi history books i have read or referenced this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country i would recommend anderson and stansfield 's book as an example of one of the best books in this area the way polk has the book organized it would be reasonable to have high hopes there are six chapters ancient iraq islamic iraq british iraq revolutionary iraq american iraq and whose iraq he appears to have the important bases covered but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and presentation of iraq 's history at least at the governmental level another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book from an academic standpoint this is baffling his experience in the field notwithstanding it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography the key here is to recognize that at its heart this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of iraq but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the particularly bush has handled iraq onto that criticism polk is one of those authors that rightly and mostly accurately points out all of the bad things the has done when it comes to iraq from a moral or humanitarian perspective of course it 's wrong to give support to someone like hussein i think most people would agree with that what baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the had done even though it was not the reason given the had accumulated quite a large moral debt to iraq in short we owed it to iraqis to get rid of saddam further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in feldman 's what we owe iraq '' and cushman 's a matter of principle '' my last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about intentions and mistakes and believe me these are all warranted polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help iraqis build a better future and more importantly he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if hussein was still in power today i think it 's important and necessary to call the on its mistakes but at the end of the day the actually helped get rid of a dictator this time and even though we owe this to a lot of other countries i can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case and that for all the other problems there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in iraq that chance certainly did not exist under hussein the biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand iraq but this book i believe is doing more harm than good if you 've done a fair amount of reading on iraq this will be clear so that 's not the danger here what would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of iraq after reading it these are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because i have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it while not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as michael moore or sean hannity it is much more disappointing because polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work framed in those terms this book is largely a failure
extemely thoroughly researched but author has gone astray with his novel burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot which is convoluted and unconvincing characterization is weak and overall the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise that is he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book
the premise and are straight lifts from stephen king 's the stand '' the characters are unidimensional and plastic the ending is saccharine save your money or spend it on the original and far superior version of this yarn
this book is so outdated all the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980 's and earlier which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past there are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
i agree the book has many many good insights and most of it makes sense you can theoretically use his techniques but sometimes they are just unrealistic in situations also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited i would not buy this again it 's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee it seriously lacks depth but it 's a decent read but you will forget everything you read in 2 days i 'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money time and effort
thomas berry promotes a new story '' of the universe also known as the earth story '' universe story '' or new cosmology '' the new cosmology essentially is a godless new age and scientific account of creation rather than a religious story sadly berry is widely promoted as a catholic author yet there is nothing catholic about this book in fact the book is generally critical of christianity and western culture during our time of environmental crisis we need to turn to god the creator of the universe this book will only steer us away save your money there are better christian faith and ecology books out there
while this is an excellent and well written story the blackstone audio version is horribly read it is painful to listen to the reader is very nasal '' and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific find another version or read the book if you can i ca n't and had to endure this version of the audiobook i listen to a lot of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare
which is sad because the material is laid out great but the amount of errors ruins it there are typos everywhere significant typos such as the wrong sign in an equation or missing punctuation in the answers of the grammar drills if you do get the book make sure you do the math for yourself because you 'll catch yourself correcting the book fairly often
this book of more than a thousand pages has every topic that could possibly be on the act the topics are explained in a clear concise manner but there are so many topics that their explanations are almost too concise two or three sentences of explanations are given and a couple of examples the format of the examples are in a no and yes format for the english section the drills in the english section and science have good explanations with them but in the math section in which work might be needed there are no explanations only answers the reading section has no explanation either the diagnostic test and four other tests gives you great explanations for each topic though do n't get me wrong some topics are explained well because of the many but other topics are really sketchy on the details also in the english section the book expects you to memorize all the '' terms like superlative and present perfect i had never even heard of those terms until i had taken a spanish class moreover other books might help you memorize things by acronyms but this book if just full of dry information if you have to take the act in a couple months or weeks this is a very bad book for you with all this info you would need a year to get through it all moreover there is so much stuff that you really do n't need for the act this book gives you years worth of information you can really tell from the science topics of astrology meteorology physics etc at least now i understand the elusive diffence between who and whom
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers there are so many open ends in the story chartacters are not distinctly outlined tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision '' i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle '' designed to make the question of 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side by normalizing generalizing and minimalizing 's crimes are we loosing our morality how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company be thoughtful
i did n't even finish the book by the end of the first chapter i was disgusted by the completely portrayal of women particularly minority women as abject victims of white men i agree that this book has its roots in truth but i think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written i did n't like the attitude of the author she seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered what about black males or white women or native americans just because i did n't see them in the first chapter does n't mean they are n't discussed at all but it did n't set the right tone for me
feminist icon angela davis goes way out of her depth by claiming that the american women 's suffrage movement itself was racist the evidence she cites has no currency with historians of women 's suffrage or of century america her analysis of the current women 's movement rests on much stronger ground
while the book is not bad the authors will give you the irritating feeling that they have milked this cow for all it is worth where does it end chicken soup for the soup lover 's soul chicken soup for the mountain climbers soul chicken soup for the amazon reviewer 's soul where there is a buck to be made on inspiration the authors of the chicken soup '' series will sniff it out
this book was the required textbook for my organic i and ii class and it did n't help with either if you did n't understands something the way the professor explained it the book provided no help the explainations in it were very short and were of no help at all most of the time the examples were too simple to really teach you anything this is a very elementary textbook that does n't seem worthy to me of a place in any college or university
this text is an easy read and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples so why the low rating organic chemistry is all about prediction '' and when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you 've never seen before it is lacking ! you can study this text two hours a day every day and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry i do n't you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed try organic chemistry as a second language '' and organic chemistry ii as a second language '' they will have you predicting and understanding orgo in no time ! ! this course is n't hard at once someone explains it to you properly david klein the author of those two books does that beautifully
mcmurry is a colourful and textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic mcmurry 's style is to induce learning of via memorizing of reaction mechanisms and other trivial components the only reason you should buy this book same reason i did is if your course is based on this that being this is your prescribed text it is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook however this may not be the case for this edition of mcmurry organic chemistry by wade has the same chapter format covers essentially the same thing but treats the fundamental principles with more depth allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry one thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for ir frequencies of major functional groups and mass spectra is barely covered it is at best just mentioned nothing more wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth something which is essential in second year chemistry all in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics when it discuses oxidatation that at least should be a review of redox the chapters on substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory but it is the basics that are lacking i would suggest for first time students to consult wade and compare it to the writing style of mcmurry albeit mcmurry is very nice and colourful you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry the book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in australia which suggests the severe lackings of this book this has been inherent in it for the last three editions not too happy with it
this is the required text for my course i 've read it thoroughly and it seems great but it definitely is not getting me the grade i want i 'm buying a different textbook to supplement
mcmurry 's text is a very friendly gentle intro to organic it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read but it does n't teach you what you need to know explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief and the problems included are usually very basic and general the spectroscopy and synthesis problems in particular if you 're looking to become a chemist this is not the book to learn from i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook or any number of texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully on exams or out in the industry
my friend told me this book is incredible but i found it a little far fetched personally why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up warning spoiler alert in the end of the book it would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters me i think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far two stars for your book ernest ! one star for each caracter you put in the story even including fish ! youre rating is as good as melvile got for his fish book so chin up
i was forced to read this in grade but could hardly bear reading it initially i 'd had high hopes for it because we 'd read such intelligent intriguing novels earlier in the year including lord of the flies '' and catcher in the rye '' but what a bore it was ! old santiago goes out to fish hoping to catch the big one '' drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best biggest '' that must mean i 'm macho a real man ! blah blah blah ca n't catch anything blah blah blah and when he finally catches the big one it is eaten by sharks the stupidest book ever i 've never been a hemingway fan and this book steered me further away from his work a pathetic book by a pathetic man
i read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that i was not in the right space to appreciate this book when i read it this was the most boring piece of literature ever written i know it was a period of age story but pages upon pages of people picking cotton talking about cotton and talking about picking cotton zzzzzz took me forever to finish because i kept passing out and having nightmares yep cotton
i understand the fascination with this 'book ' people want to make changes in their lives find love money family happiness etc but people want to do it the cheapest way possible ! come on guys are you kidding me what do you actually expect for 5 dollars this book attempts to show you how to use goal setting to change things in your life but there are so few pages each with a tiny amount of information i have seen one extended review here on amazon by a man called brad jenson the pamphlet isnt much longer ! if you want to change your life then you have to invest in your future two books i have to recommend are 'the ultimate guide to cosmic ordering ' by andronicos andronicou its expensive but its worth it a really fantastic book that expects you to go 'out there ' but trust in it and you will get some amazing results the other book is 'ask and it is given ' by ester and jerry hicks the book will help you to find balance in your life if you are still wondering if this pamphlet will work for you let me give you a little bit of advice go outside take a 5 dollar bill from your wallet and set it on fire with a cigarette lighter you may wonder 'what is the point in that ' my answer is that i just saved you a 2 day wait for an amazon delivery there is so much better stuff out there go find what interest you buy it and change your life
let me see if i have got this right the only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way that way we all gain ok the bosses of nike mcdonalds and will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide sounds good who would want to be the party pooper ! well someone 's got to be and for the simple reason that we do n't live on a planet the size of jupiter the oil 's finite we know that but ca n't be bothered to act on it even the supply of water is turning out to be finite the south east of england is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water ok they could ship it in from the rest of the uk where there 's no problem but for reasons that do n't quite add up that 's not possible it 's not the corporate solution if you will forgive the pun has it occurred to anyone i wonder if it 's growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems yes i know marx and stalin do n't offer any fixes but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced growth is going to whether we like it or not
de soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights it 's incredibly difficult for poor people specifically recent urban migrants to get legal title to their land as a result the poor make extralegal '' arrangements squatting on and using land that neighbors but not the government recognize as theirs but because they do n't own the land they ca n't get a mortgage on their house to start a business electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services the government has difficulty taxing them because they do n't have a legal address and so on and so on it 's a very important point but de soto oversells arguing with exaggerated and ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor he occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work for example he has helped businesses in peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes a useful bit of empirical information but those gems appear all too occasionally before reading this entire book i recommend going to the website of de soto 's foundation the institute for liberty and democracy at and reading the main point there in one tenth the words
is the first time i tried to read an and the experience was very unconfortable unconfortable to read impossible to record as a file only to read in 1 pc and at the end impossible to print ! please try another way to sell electronics books
michael dirda reviewer for the washington post has called john crowley probably the finest fantasy writer alive lord knows he has written complex masterpieces little big '' the aegypt '' series engine summer '' the great work of time '' etc but some of his more recent works show a really disturbing unevenness in quality so why does n't this wonderful author stop writing pot boilers like this and finish the last of the four book aegypt '' series arguably the finest written fantasy series ever now that i strongly recommend
why was this book written if this was an actual novel by lord byron maybe the overstuffed mishmash of a plot doppelgangers ! duels ! zombies ! war ! madness ! would have shed useful light on his life but as a pastiche all it really is is an overstuffed mishmash interspersed with an epistolary novel about a young woman forming a relationship with her father an expatriate roman polansky type i kept comparing it unfavorably with another piece of 's writing jonathan strange and norrell '' which at twice the length is still by far the more engrossing read that too is overstuffed but it gives the sense that all the many pieces have been carefully placed by an intelligent authorial hand crowley in lbn '' tries to take the sting out of his book 's incoherence by passing it off as an uncorrected first draft the one effect lbn '' had on me was to go and read some byron but even that urge was blunted by the epistolary characters ' repeated references to how opaque and unread byron is i got this book as a present which is the only reason i read it all the way through it 's going to be a long time before i pick up anything else by crowley
i enjoyed the half of this book that i read which is to say i found the byronic completely unreadable and i am a fan of overembellished melodramatic novels so this was actually the part of the book to which i was most looking forward but was completely engrossed by the relationships depicted and developed through the series of emails to me those were the richest and most eloquent part of the novel and i could easily have spent another 200 pages with those three characters every time i would hit a section of novel '' i would get irritated at being interrupted so i 'm not sure if i would recommend this book or not as the only way i could enjoy it was not to read half of it
although carol dweck is a women i feel this book would do well in a college women studies '' class good stuff but a little tuff on guys and pity for women maybe i am stuck in a mindset '' but harps a little too much on women issues for me i will be alble to utilize some material from the book but would suggest it as a good read for women
i was so impressed that rubenstein had been named teacher of the year and that he used humor in his title that i really wanted to read his book many of us want to hear eachothers ' stories and gain knowledge new perspective or steal from another teacher 's toolbox of tricks my opinion of rubenstein 's experience is that he has become a hardened sarcastic and unresponsive teacher his theories and strategies are very last century and i do not mean 1990. while i applaud his ability to poke fun at himself to recognize that he is always under the microscope of his students and to have created a strategy that worked '' for him i cringe at the lessons humane societal responsive responsible that he 's teaching his high school students my suggestion to all educators ' looking for a helpful book on classroom management and discipline is to first take a good long hard look at themselves and ask two questions first what do i want the children to learn second how am i planning hte activity for success
it was mark twain who popularized the aphorism of benjamin disraeli that there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics i kept hearing all these marvelous things about freakonomics a book by steven levitt and stephen dubner so when i ran across it at 25 off i did a stupid freakin ' thing and bought it i thought what the freak i 've got a pretty inquisitive mind and i 'm open to seeing things differently to discovering new viewpoints the doubt started early when i got the book home and i first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of time the new york times the washington post and the los angeles times when all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is i 'm immediately going to be freakin ' suspicious author malcolm gladwell tells us on the cover prepare to be dazzled '' well evidently ol ' malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than i am i wo n't even mention the smug mug of stephen dubner that taunted me from the book 's dust jacket because i do n't want you to get the idea that i judge a book by its cover or in this case a writer by his physiognomy so i wo n't mention that if you 're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70 of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver 's home then you just might be dazzled by freakonomics if i tell you that the company that issues its employees only 3 uniform shirts thinking that it is cutting costs is probably increasing its overhead and this fact astounds you if you must ask but how '' then yes buy freakonomics and be dazzled mostly what freakonomics offers when its conclusions can be trusted is just what we used to call common sense '' but since america has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent zombies staring vacuously at that box of survivors and american idols and lost knuckleheads good common sense now appears to dazzle the dead when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands that is i dove into freakonomics hoping to find my purchase worthwhile i got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized everything would require and verifying on that page smug mug tells us based on a single report by the institute of medicine that drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health '' fortunately i read your body 's many cries for water by doctor batmanghelidj over a decade ago so i already knew what a bunch of bunk that was in chapter 4 smug mug proves '' that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the roe wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate this represents the centerpiece of his book both literally and ideologically the first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early on page 92 the author acknowledges that the police in atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early in hopes of landing the 1996 olympics well would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the as predicted true being honest might be means to an increased budget but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control and surely the chamber of commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception let me ask do you actually feel you 're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early that 's funny me neither there 's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported and recently an officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the they were able to do in the and because crime is so now in dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime if this claim is a verity dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10 of the drop having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian it 's funny that i find myself even contending with the stats smug mug uses that actually work against his theory i believe the hiring of police officers since the early could have impacted the crime rate only minimally less than the 10 while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly and dubner concludes that firearm laws simply do n't bring down crime '' be sure to read the utterly fascinating book gunfighters highwaymen vigilantes by roger mcgrath for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint ! in dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion i did n't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early and i wonder if that might have some statistical bearing ya think yes i think smug mug is selective he calls some abortions a crude and drastic sort of insurance policy '' not immoral '' not sinful '' but then i did n't expect smug mug to call a sin a sin and even if levitt and dubner 's hypothesis is correct that abortions have lowered crime the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered so why are we even discussing this i 'll tell you why because the folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus and now they 're pulling out all the stops trying to statistically '' convince the masses that they 're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing i find this repulsive ! and there are studies indicating that those missing people have and will continue to have a negative economic impact on society i wo n't even go into chapter 5 what makes a perfect parent suffice to say that as usual surprise ! surprise ! all the statistics dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs just know that if you 're a working mother you have n't cheated your child in the least but if you 're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order you are unenlightened '' if your kid is watching lots of tv it is n't turning the child 's brain to mush '' no word on whether or not it 's turning morals to mush though and the studies that we are called to pay attention to show that a child 's character was n't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care whether he had one parent or two whether his mother worked or did n't whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each '' i 've often wondered what might have happened to me if my mom who was home most of the time had n't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day year after year while i was growing up in the and i 've given freakonomics two stars because i did find the section on the naming of children very interesting as well as the story of stetson kennedy 's fight against the three ks '' but if you 're smarter than i am you 'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it economically speaking that 's just common cents ''
i do n't know if i will make it through the last 50 pages of this book it 's bored me so i was really excited to get it based on the on amazon but it focuses so much on crime and abortion it 's far from a rogue economist exploring the hidden side of everything '' i probably should n't rate a book that i 've only read of but i ca n't see the last being so good that it changes my mind
i am really confused this book or booklet was like a bad version of a guidepost it was n't all that witty and the tales were n't that good i bought this book figuring it would charming and funny like the book marley and me '' was lame dull religious and feel like i should charge amazon a fee for wasting my time money and energies ! what a rip off ! below 1 star if that is viable
personally i did not like this book it was too christian with everything having to relate to christianity i did not find it funny at all the stories are the kind of thing you get in emails
this book is just a lame and very christian book of anecdotes by a tennessean who hopes to do lectures and sell books it has absolutely nothing to do with john grogan the columnists absolutely brilliant book marley and me i really wish amazon would not relate the two books i am planning to return this tomorrow this book is going to be returned tomorrow i found it awful and in many places distasteful read marley and me and not the other work by this other john grogan thank you
after immensely enjoying the mother tongue i had high hopes for made in america sadly mr bryson let me down first i expected a history of the development of american english for the first chapter or so it went that way and then it became a popular history of the us with a little then some words were created '' thrown in as a popular history it was i think that was caused by mr bryson organizing his book thematically instead of chronologically i suspect this book was a compilation of essays published in england which presented too much work to reorganize for a book this suspicion leads me to my second major critique which is mr bryson 's unsympathetic view of americans some of this disdain for folks who simply want to make a living in today 's world and enjoy a weekend or who live along society 's margins '' was more apparent in a walk in the woods but you can see the seed of that attitude in this book in throwaway comments about religious people i think he was much more sympathetic to the average '' englishman in notes from a small island than he is to the average '' american here i 'm leery about reading i 'm a stranger here myself for this reason amazingly i think his discussion of the pc movement was pretty good one of the constants of the english language is that it 's always changing and that we should n't hold to outdated elements of speech just because they 've always been around at the same time change is n't always necessarily progress and we should n't change language just because a small number of people find offense the tempest that pops up every couple of years about the word niggardly '' is a cautionary tale about giving the ignorant access to megaphones mr bryson did n't draw the line where i would have but he gets credit for drawing a line bottom line it 's not a bad book but not among mr bryson 's best if you 're new to his work read notes from a small island the mother tongue or a short history of everything all of which are marvelous
bill bryson 's zest for life is made manifest in the books he 's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest this admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading as he 's educated himself on distant places science etymology and such and produced books about them this one sadly is disappointing it is a rote of american history of the cherished myths debunked '' school of history writing from the sixties he 's read his howard zinn and it shows this dated approach is too well too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new bryson fan politics intrudes most in the final chapters for instance the pages on the cold war could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms such as peacenik '' peace offensive '' and red diaper baby '' but the liberal bryson instead renders the contest with communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business and dwells on military from the vietnam war more oddly he defends the early wave of political correctness and its assault on the language he professes to love tepid colorless and was never an invention of humorists as he claims at one point though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage strange hey some books should best be left to the pros simple as that
i am so sorry i had n't taken the time to read the customer 's reviews of made in america and the lost continent prior to buying them frankly i 'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing the only thing i was able to take away from them was the idea that bill bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything north american usa only is considered extremely good fun and humorous
was worthless was not the correct match for my class book requirement never used it if someone wants it you can have it for free
one ca n't be sure that this book is n't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad that if this were n't crappy it would n't sell even for someone who believes in csik 's theory of flow this book is a instead of making clear statements backed by evidence the book 's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions there is no reason to read this when his original popularization flow more carefully and clearly summarizes csikszentmihalyi 's interesting research
i was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead what i got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary american society and is cheering for its imminent demise i knew the book was n't going to be cheery or optimistic but this was way too depressing i do n't need this kind of pessimisim in my life
another hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this dystopic rubbish i 'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of 12 monkeys '' or the fight club '' this is just nihilist rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans ' productive capacity like the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel i 'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for or century britain but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization like this author would have us believe the collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth if there is not enough oil we can switch to coal solar wind geothermal biomass and nuclear fission or the future all these futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point how many science fiction authors in the early 1980 's or before predicted the emergence of the internet almost none by my estimate do n't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent he 's a nihilist and misanthrope as long as men are free to think communicate and trade optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards
with so many serious perspectives available on peak oil '' there is no reason to waste time on this screed which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates and he hates of course all that which he does not understand he hates the american south and its culture interstates strip malls the arab nations and most of all suburbs and the people who live in them he loves israel the liberal northeast as it was fifty years ago israel hateful rants and israel peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the arab states will lose their power along with their oil how the suburbs and will collapse without cheap motoring and the greatest reach of all how the south and west will for some reason suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil and have the least access to alternatives solar wind biofuels this last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the american population from the dying rust belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south of course he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil back then he was making the same arguments about how was going to destroy all those things he despises as were a lot of the other peak oilers everywhere kunstler goes he sees only ugliness this is to be expected the ugliness lies within him so he will never escape it give this one a wide berth and learn something about austrian economics you 'll be glad you did
i tried to read this book but could not finish it the book had an interesting message but it was lost in the inaccuracies broad sweeping statements and linear logic his comments about peak oil were inaccurate there are plenty of books barrels a second for example that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight with regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence he failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast for the record i am originally from the upper midwest but lived in the southeast for 7 years much of his prognostications about the future are linear that is if a then b then the author is in his late and i would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment if the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars drive less close off portions of the house in the winter do n't use the air conditioner purchase smaller homes etc if the environment changes people constantly adjust including me the author and you what bothers me most about the book is that young people with less '' will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be the author 's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future but if life is a dynamic process the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur
this has been a story of an american soldier whose involvement in the making of the world 's greatest dictionary was singular astonishing memorable and laudable and yet at the same time wretchedly sad '' prologue well that certainly could have been the story but what it was was a history of the dictionary as in the history of the horse '' with minor 's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so winchester the author of several other books i 'll avoid also seems to suffer from the common malady or unwillingness of not knowing how to end a book so the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into the history of 's whatever you want to call what minor suffered whereas i should have shed a tear when the main character assuming it was n't a dictionary was laid to rest at age 85 i was fairly glad to see him go
the theme is interesting enough an american inmate of a british lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of oed unfortunately the book does n't have much beyond the outline of the theme as some other reviewers have noted it would have made a decent magazine article but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition semi relevant trivia and melodramatic hyperbole of the superior '' victorian english kind
i bought this book because i expected it to be a of de la cruz 's from teen to something a bit more serious being a bit of an outcast myself i expected to sympathize with the character of schuyler van alen however while the main plotline of the story was just as shallow if not more so than the au pairs the secondary prologue plotline was what truly disappointed me i am a writer i am not published and i 'm only eighteen but what i do a lot of in my free time is write and when i 'm not writing about fantasy worlds sometimes i actually have to do research about our own world for the book to make sense de la cruz and her editors seem to not care about this at all i realize that she grew up in the phillippines and therefore the history of the mayflower might not have been as ingrained into her childhood as it was into mine but a bit of internet research could have prevented her from making the painful errors she made in writing this book for example 1. on page three the first entry the writer states it has been a difficult winter '' as her opening comment if you will notice the date on the top of the page it is november november is not winter nor as the narrator later states have the settlers even docked yet the difficult winter did not occur until the settlers had arrived in plymouth 2. about plymouth they spelled it ' at the time 3. on page 56 the second entry the narrator writes joyful news the people of this new land have welcomed us with open arms and many gifts they brought us wild game a large bird that could feed an army a bunch of vegetables and maize '' this is supposedly the of november 1620. the indians did not meet the pilgrims until march 1621. the first thanksgiving as de la cruz alludes to was not celebrated until august of that year the reason the pilgrims suffered through their first winter was their isolation from other people including the indians the narrator also states we are heartened by the sight of the verdant land the vast virgin acres '' other than the nauseatingly blatant and inept attempt at alliteration i wonder exactly how ' the ' could have looked in late november in massachusetts interesting how de la cruz first calls november winter and then suddenly it 's spring ! 4. on page 80 diary entry three the narrator states today myles standish took a team down the coast the roanoke to bring medicine food and supplies to the settlers there it is a fortnight 's sail so they will be gone a good while '' this is the thirtieth of november need i reiterate my previously made point about the plymouth settlers ' isolation they would have had no contact with roanoke furthermore the colonists did not have extra medicine food or supplies they barely had enough for themselves 5. on pages 125 and 184 the last two diary entries the narrator writes the men have been gone for days now and still there is no word we are frightened they should have arrived there and returned by now with news of the colony but all is silent '' and alas ! alas ! everyone from roanoke is disappeared myles and the men found nothing of the colony '' respectively these entries were for december and respectively let 's think about this shall we aside from the fact that the words alas ! alas ! '' reek of something i might have written to show ' in the third grade after reading too much historical fiction the journey to roanoke '' would take a fortnight as stated in entry three that means a round trip would take two fortnights as in four weeks november is n't even three weeks the men should not have been back by then nor should they have come back on december they should have come back on december as i said before i am eighteen my elementary school teachers drilled the story of the pilgrims into us from a very young age i am surprised after reading the reviews by everyone else on here that no one else picked up on this very crucial fact how do i catch things that published authors and paid editors do not are the powers that be at hyperion all exceptionally bad at american history or have they let de la cruz get away with shoddy writing and simply because they know the success of her earlier au pairs books would lead to millions buying this book followed by the continued of american teenagers that they would let something so blatantly wrong onto bookshelves astounds me most authors know to do research before writing in fact most high schoolers do and this was a slap in all of our faces i already wrote all of this in a letter to hyperion asking them to revise or recall the book but like the ostriches they are they have done nothing to this effect people ! do n't accept this sort of tripe ! look at what i have to say and do n't hesitate to follow me in petitioning hyperion and de la cruz
would you like a sneak preview of half the book ok '' she was wearing a slim costume national black sheath dress prada slingbacks and the ubiquitous string of pearls around her swanlike neck '' or '' mimi looked devastating in a midnight satin peter som dress with her hair in a high chignon a triple strand of heriloom south sea pearls rule 1 mimi always looks devastating rule 2 everyone is amazingly thin and amazingly beautiful they can eat junk food like pigs and never gain a pound and their model good looks are featured on billboard ad campaigns in times square ! yay ! this is great for my self confidence reading about thin amazingly beautiful rich and smart people who lead fabulous lives in new york my 4.0 gpa and and varsity participation in sports is now seeming paltry in comparison i must be a natural born model and beauty ! this book focuses on rich socialites a la gossip girls half the book is spent describing the fabulous ravishing outfits and exclusive designers everyone is wearing this was such a strange combination having all this weird vampire stuff thrown in a story only to be masked and dominated by the incredible shallowness of the main characters ok ! this is what melissa de la cruz does she writes about fashion and celebrities her author bio clearly stated that she writes chic lit novels about beautiful people and snooty parties and debutante cat fights there is a market for this kind of stuff and apparently girls my age like this kind of thing i represent that percentage that really enjoys reading and prefers a strong plot and story line to mind numbing description of fashion that 's me i honestly do realize that there are few people my age who enjoy reading as much as i do and and read as often as i do so i have read a ton of books i have alot to compare blue bloods to and it 's just not the kind of thing i like but i know there are lots of people that do as proven by the enormous popularity of the gossip girl and the books i can grudgingly accept this and just not read books like that i accidently do read them sometimes and that is how this nasty review came to exist i will admit that however much i did not like the book as a whole it 's vampire storyline was a unique one for me and i would have liked to find out how the story ends and how the conflict is resolved i will not be lured into reading the sequel books like this for those who liked it the daugthers of the moon series by lynne ewing my own interest in this series died at around age that series about candles red is for remembrance blue is for whatever i also never read more than the first book alas at 15 i 'm just too old and bookishly snooty to read books like this anymore if i had still been i might have liked it
if you read the outside cover of the cd audiobook you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which fdr and eleanor roosevelt led the country during world war ii however what you get is more often innuendo about fdr 's fascination with women other than his wife whether his prviate secretaries a visiting princess or his mistress of many years eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected but she comes off pretty well her husband 's wandering eye notwithstanding goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the united states during the critical war years but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected i had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy and the challenges it served the president i had hopes of more on fdr 's handling of race and labor issues but did not get it i had hopes of learning more about fdr 's partnership with the congress to achieve the nation 's goals but was disappointed there as well this was the first goodwin book i picked up and it did n't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good team of rivals about lincoln and his cabinet still i remain disappointed that the book 's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected
i was looking forward to reading this book because of all the praise it recieved perhaps my standards were too high coming into it but i found this book to be tedious and completely unentertaining so many pages could have been removed that added nothing to the story i found the main characters personal life to be stereotypical and the story around the old man 's biography was a chore to get through my recommendation would be to avoid this book as i felt it was a waste of time
broderick is at his best in quoting some of the scientists at the leading edge however he often fails to distinguish between the leading edge and the mere fringe he is at his worst when he declares his own opinions much of what he thinks he knows simply is n't so a little research might have helped
this book is disappointing i do n't think broderick understands the technology or its social impact which is a major problem considering the book is an attempt to explain the causes and effect on our lives of the spike '' he quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis and it 's a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source also the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it he explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology nanotechnology or but i call it minting '' hunh maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting but i call it boring which given the subject matter it should n't be and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond or a or what i call
this book tries to be a personal memoir a guide and perhaps an academic treatise on the psychology of though the author does not appear to be qualified relying instead on others it fails on all fronts if you want to read personal accounts of women 's experiences of hope edelman 's books are
you have to give kudos to sher she really does pull out all the stops on trying to figure out what you want to do with your life i fit into the last category of her book those for whom nothing interests me '' was said to describe while she 's quite blunt on the causes she dose n't really give any concrete help on what to do about it and her suggestion to just remember a time when you did find things interesting well if that helped i would n't be reading her book in the first place what if nothing interested you back then either i mean really she 's very long on the theory and pull yourself up by the bootstraps '' but very short on what to do when you have n't the foggiest on what to do i had very high hopes for this book and it was very disappointing
my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths i immediately fell in love with the stories the prose the poetry and so went on to buy this complete volume while it is nice to have all borges 's stories in one place and at a reasonable price the language does n't really hold up for me the translation is well not sloppy but too simple like those childrens ' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in grade i have nothing against andrew hurley but his translation of borges leaves me cold i 'd give borges 5 stars out of 5 but hurley no more than 2
todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad y aqul que dice que borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin sus historias a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras autores sucesos etc etc sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista pero su ya mencionado didactismo su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como ficciones '' o el aleph '' estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico a todas luces el de borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas los aduladores borgianos esa grimosa secta compuesta generalmente de elitistas literarios seguramente dira leyendo crticas como la ma que la razn por la que borges me desagrada es porque no lo entiendo '' nada de lo que preocuparse pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al seor del bastn '' no falla probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general en fin que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra pedante '' del diccionario total como no hay libros malos sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores frikis '' como tolkien o lovecraft y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta he llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de borges y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la correcta '' apreciacin de este escritor que de verdad a m me enferma sin duda a borges se le puede considerar independientemente de sus mritos literarios un autntico soberano de insufribles no niego que borges era un buen lector que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos y que como crtico era bastante avispado pero desde luego en el plano literario era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin en mi opinin un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a adaptarse '' continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes presuntuoso superfluo y sobre todo frustrante pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar he optado por escribir este comentario en castellano idioma en el que borges redacto sus obras pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio cervantes '' en fin que de su incompetencia fascinante desvergenza la suya iba a decir chaqueterismo '' pero se me olvidaba que borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos as que mejor ser callar que igual no estoy capacitado vete t a saber un clsico sobrevalorado ms y van puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de borges creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos me resulta ms digerible
i was recommended borges ' works by one of his innumerable sycophants and i will never forget the tremendous time i wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life 's work when i should have been writing my dissertation each time i read one of his pedantic mediocre peices of short fiction i was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that i would like other examples of his work if i continued reading since all of his stories are so unique '' i found the exact opposite to be true one story after another about mazes mirrors mystical mathematical formulas and books books books the ideas were transperant the language boring in the extreme his poetry is trite who needs this borges reads like a petulant graduate student at university of chicago who failed repeatedly to get short fiction published in atlantic particularly among academics literary elites and like people many seem to cite borges and worship his genius more than read him and certaintly reads him critically i read most of his work and i can tell you outside of a few interesting turns of phrase you 'd be better off reading a yale dissertation on the semiotics of people incessantly talk about how imaginative borges is the vast majority of popular sf and fantasy writers are more imaginative even many of the despicable magical realist geniuses '' make borges look rather plain borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of manhattan or cambridge if you 're this kind of pompous fellow you 'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of luis by your side and a series of mirrors as it were slowly attempting to seek some kind of with this benighted old librarian if you 're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters enjoying nuanced use of language and grasping subtle daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter run far far away from jorge luis borges even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews the adulation of borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among those who think themselves intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction i think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams and not an example of literary genius in that sense spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work and that 's about as much attention as he deserves
this is basically a personal journal the artist 's ruminations about art and life very dry reading rothko often contradicts himself there are several books available such as those published by taschen which are much more readable and are filled with beautiful illustrations of the artist 's work
one of the commercial reviews indicates that this book is a period piece '' and that description probably best describes the book it was written in a period of time long before rothko was working his signature style and had achieved any success it also did n't help that the introduction by the late painter 's son christopher rothko was unnecessarily portentious the later parts concerning the history of the manuscripts also written by christopher rothko do tone down the excess language and are quite interesting the essays themselves seem incomplete pedestrian in spots and extremely dated as others have noted rothko does n't talk about his own work who is the audience of this book completists researchers it ca n't be that many people something like the publicaton of kurt cobain 's journals in book form several years after his suicide had relevance to that artist even if it was a bit like peeking into somebody 's diary the artist 's reality '' has almost no relevance to most fans of mark rothko and certainly none to those who appreciate his more famous style of painting
it wo n't let you print in other words you have to be in front of a computer to read this book i know it is an but it would be nice to be able to print out a few pages to read at the doctor 's office or on the plane in additon the layout is incomplete there are no items associated with the index topics the pictures are slow to load and look third rate etc another little problem is that the book can only ever be read from two computers i travel for work so i am stuck '' with the first two computers i read it on i am really dissapointed and i will be contacting amazon regarding a refund
i 'm a big fan of dan poynter 's book the manual so i expected that this book would be of comparable quality unfortunately that just is n't the case there is some information relating to the new book model '' publication process that should be helpful but what little information exists is difficult to extract from this book which has been very poorly designed and laid out the pages are constantly broken by quotes that loosely relate to the text and this makes it difficult for the actual content to read smoothly the text itself seems disjointed as if poynter has just copied and pasted passages of previous articles together and little attention has been paid to making this a coherent and informative book the graphics used in the book are of poor an obvious example of someone who does n't know how to prepare graphics for print and an indication that this book was just slapped together i hope this is n't what dan poynter means by the new book model '' as this was an incredibly disappointing book both aesthetically and as a text while i think electronic publishing is a medium that 's here to stay and incredibly valuable i do disagreee with dan poynter 's assertion in this book that the only 'dead tree ' books in the future will be coffee table books as an art form these books will be used to decorate homes and offices other information will be disseminated electronically without sacrificing trees '' certainly this will never happen as long as new book model '' publishers publish books of this quality consumers will demand books of greater informational value that present the information in an and attractive manner which i 'm disappointed to discover dan poynter is willing to sacrifice in any case the fact is there are actually more trees growing in the united states now as a result of our vast use of paper and lumber than there were 200 years ago the save the trees '' argument for is just wrong there are a lot of good reasons to but trees are n't among them it 's worth noting that far fewer trees would have died in the printing of this book had the author left out the exessive quotes and textboxes that pad this book 's all in all i 'm disappointed with writing nonfiction the information in this book that is of any value really belongs in poynter 's infinitely better and more comprehensive book the manual one chapter would cover it i also recommend avery cardoza 's the complete guide to successful publishing
i am a fan of dan poyter 's and i have learned a lot from this author 's monumental work the manual '' i thought this title writing nonfiction turning thoughts into books '' is another one of such great works i was so disappointed while reading this book when i realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book i just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience i do n't know if you get i just do n't to make matters worse this title is not as detailed as the original work so if you are interested in learning from this man i suggest that you get a copy of the manual '' rather than this one i gave this book 1 star not because it does not contain useful information but because it contains nothing new from the author 's previous publication it is really unfortunate i felt cheated
this book was not in the same league of frazier 's first effort i found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end the lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out i really wanted to like this book and i was trying hard to like it as i read it but the fact of the matter is this is a bad book
after cold mountain i was sure that thirteen moons would be my read of the year unfortunately it fell extremely short of being even a good read i could n't wait for it to be finished i think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a and compassionate telling of the plight of the indian nation of the smokey mountains especially the cherokee i felt he was writing more for an r rated hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated to cold mountain an outstanding book by the way could have been another cold mountain but ended up for me a cold turkey
charles frazier created a thirsty audience with his deservedly acclaimed cold mountain and what author with a generous advance in the bank can resist the attempt to quench that thirst quickly whether or not he has the material and inspiration to succeed charles had neither and thirteen moons is the proof the plot is glacial and uneven the characters other than his melancoly protagonist shallow the atmosphere overwrought still he has immense talent so let 's hope that his next effort returns to the exquisite form of cold mountain the novel does have its moments i grew very fond of waverly and was distraught when he was violated i thought early on that i understood claire a femme fatale la belle dame sans merci but she never fulfilled that early promise frazier 's anthropological exposition of cherokee customs and values is instructive and the great tragedy inflicted on the cherokee nation by the inexorable force of european immigrants is heartrending so i 'll be on the lookout for frazier 's next opus eager but also skeptical
the writer used to many big words making the book very hard to understand the book was very hard to read and impossible to understand this book was not written for the average reader
this is the first book by shaara i have read and if his other works are like this it is also the last on the cover persico is quoted as saying shaara makes literature read like history and history read like literature '' he goes on to claim that shaara brings the war to pulsating life '' i have even read a review that claimed this book was better than remarque 's all quiet on the western front i must have been reading a different book the first chapter the replacement is a great short story after reading it i had hight expectations for the book unfortunately it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view and the history reads like an grade textbook his narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived they are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them after the dislocated short story of the first chapter the book delves into a story of the flying aces interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story it frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book shaara does n't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918 's when the americans arrive focusing as i noted before primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war i should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own here however it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by worthy of a story or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the british or french perspective and i have no particularly problem with him focusing on the american perspective on the war but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry i suppose a smaller book does n't sell as well for those interested in historical fiction i would recommend bernard cornwall 's work and perhaps shaara can learn a bit from him
a very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager i would n't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading
i found this book to be lacking in character development plot etc it just never really went anywhere not that it needed to but it just did n't grab me as her other novels have i found it to be very underdeveloped perhaps as one other reviewer wrote this was before she hit her stride that 's what i think
i read this book after being enchanted by the accidental tourist and other of anne tyler 's books this book deals with the life of a depressed teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you i would not recommend reading it on the up side it 's really short so you can get through it rather quickly i was hoping to read a good book but only felt worse after finishing this one
i picked up this book because i 've read two other books by anne tyler that i greatly enjoyed but i was disappointed by this one maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer while entertaining the book seemed somewhat empty i did n't find the characters ' actions very believable and the surprise '' ending did not follow from anything earlier in the book as all really good surprise endings should the virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening i do recommend tyler 's books a patchwork planet '' and earthly quot
robert allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did he will send you several junk emails a day unsubscribing does n't work and trying to block the sender 's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time the funny part is that the emails are n't even coded properly they always show up as just a bunch of html code would you really take internet advice from a guy who ca n't even code html properly anyway his spamming practices are completely illegal and it 's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him but that should n't come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before he 's had several with the irs lawsuits against him and a chapter 7 bankruptcy i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods many of those practices are illegal and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it for more info on allen visit johntreed dottcomm click on real estate investing then click real estate guru ratings bottom line do n't trust this guy and do n't buy his books and if you 're reading this allen take me off your mailing list ! !
if you have n't read anything on at all or if you 're a total newbie the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business for someone who is already in the business or has already done some research this book merely repeats a lot of tips even then some of the tips like in section on affiliate programs are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic as for the first part of the book where allen demonstrates how he could earn in one day i find it totally unrealistic and it certainly wo n't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has robert allen 's background to begin with even then this sort of strategy wo n't cut it with today 's wise and cynical netizens anymore
robert allen 's previous book multiple streams of income is excellent and i ca n't say enough good things about it this one was a major disappointment in comparison he talks about the same rehashed internet marketing strategies that everyone else does creating email lists newsletters blah blah blah the most disappointing thing about robert allen and i lost so much respect for him over this is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast what 's stupid about the whole thing and demonstrates that he 's a snakeoil salesman scam artist is that what he 's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the internet so how do you make money on the internet according to robert allen by selling courses showing people how to make money on the internet is the only way to make money on the internet that 's a scam ! how does he sleep at night do n't buy this book it 's a waste of money
i truly wish i had not read this book i used to love mike and mike in the morning '' but my view of greenberg has been so damaged by this superficial shallow clueless piece of garbage that i have found myself unable to stomach listening to him anymore greenberg obviously plays up the apparently oxymoronic metrosexual sportscaster '' angle setting a defensive tone early regarding his abilities to discuss sports despite having fabulous taste in clothing travel and fine dining fine this is a play on his persona no problem but when he tries to become everyman '' greenberg demonstrates that he is as out of touch with the common populace as the athletes he covers are or as paris hilton is hence the title of this review this is also why his seinfeldian approach fails seinfeld found the common irritants we all face whereas greenberg complains that his wife left him alone for a week to raise his children with their nanny excuse me are we supposed to chuckle knowingly that he now has to parent two small children with professional assistance sorry greenberg most of us would actually be single parents in that situation not pretending similarly he tells a funny story '' about his son 's first word being a curse but it is set up by sharing that this happened in aspen in a chalet with cathedral ceilings and chandeliers how do they change the lightbulbs in those things '' he wonders increduously as we all do when vacationing in aspen in gorgeous chalets oh and what used to be six people is now three couples three nannies and seven children '' this kind of unnecessary extraneous detail which is prevalent throughout the book reinforces how different he is from me how unrelatable his experiences are to mine and breaks any sense of community that good writers are able to develop for example he also repeatedly discusses his neighbors billionaires who throw lavish parties give him cases of his favorite vodka and fly him to florida in a private jet greenberg shares that if given the option there is no better way to fly than on a private jet thanks for the tip greeny i 'll get right on that coupled with his repeated references to 100 ties prada backpacks and expensive clothing greenberg comes off as an arrogant superficial spoiled little rich brat his obvious lack of appreciation for what he has coupled with his assumption that he has anything of relevance to teach a larger audience about parenting you can not get snot off a cashmere sweater '' as but one example makes me view him as completely undeserving of his success and not wanting to contribute to it in anyway you think your life is hard because your daughter threw up on the tile floor in your spacious kitchen try wondering whether you 'll have money to pay your bills next month that 's stress the title of his book references his belief that all women think their husbands are idiots it 's his grand insight into relationships that i guess is supposed to convince us he is thoughtful and has some depth of character sorry greenberg most women i know including my wife have respect for their husbands your wife thinks you 're an idiot because you are one just like paris hilton
while i enjoy greenberg 's radio show i was extremely disappointed in this book throughout the book greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio unfortunately unlike on the radio when mike golic is always available to slap some sense into greenberg this book is purely 100 greenberg i am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives yet try to act like they have struggled '' in life greenberg has had to struggle '' thru a cushy upbringing going to exclusive schools such as northwestern and eventually landing his gig at espn for those of you in the chicago area i hope that you caught debra pickett 's article on greenberg in the chicago while greenberg professes to be a family man the article notes how he spent hours talking about his favorite topic himself while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool keeping with his privileged existence the pool was located at the east bank club in chicago yet another privileged club to which greenberg belongs i should receive a refund for slopping thru this book '' hopefully this review will prevent other people from making the mistake i did espn should fire this wimpy meterosexual '' for writing this book
as an avid sports fan that listens to mike mike show i found myself hooked on the witty banter both bring to the radio i found myself agreeing with greeny on many different issues but also was happy to have someone representing the 'every man ' point of view in dealing with sports greeny is not the former player turned sportscaster and that was something most listeners could relate to it was with these thougths in mind that i looked forward to reading his new book this is not the mike greenberg i know whomever came up with the notion that publishing a bunch of journal postings was a good idea should be fired on the spot everything was loosely tied together and most were just ramblings of a man trying to come to grips with his priviledged life the readers should feel sorry for you because your took the same week off as your wife ! ! suck it up and change a freakin ' diaper ! this book is not for fans of the mike mike show it will ruin the broadcast leave the book on the shelf and do not buy it for the sports dad on father 's day while they can get through it quickly enough they 'll be worse off having read it
i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important however there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns germs more than the other 2 and steel of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns germs and steel i enjoyed parts of the book considerably but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs collapse '' a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now
one would like to believe that a group of mit students truly did take vegas for millions as ben mezrich claims but in a era when diarists and autobiographers are routinely getting caught in lies it 's very difficult to believe this story first it reads like a bad pulp novel filled with every possible cliche security room beatings casino owners waving guns in their faces on aruban golf courses swarthy europeans threatening to kill them if they ever come back to monte carlo mix in a cast of characters straight out of central casting the russian math genius the bombshell blond the screwup with a drug problem the obese nerd and the charismatic mystery leader '' who hides hundreds of thousands of dollars in laundry baskets all over the greater boston area then add sexual misunderstandings and dialogue '' and the author 's own visits '' to vegas brothels and casinos to retrace '' the kids ' journey and you get a potboiler seemingly untethered to verifiable facts why for example did mezrich not interview the kids ' nemesis a vegas private eye who follows their movements and foils their plans everywhere they go why are there no interviews with security guards and casino managers who roughed them up in vegas aruba and monte carlo how do we can believe that any of these people even existed and that any of this is true when mezrich swallows their tale hook line and sinker read this entertaining but ultimally vacuous trifle for what it is all bluff and fluff
reads like it was written by a high school kid an annoying high school kid i paid almost 14 euros for it in the airport and feel bad
well in my opinion there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies and some people have had some unusual experiences mostly disturbing but some apparrently enlightening but the question is is it all as it seems the fact of the matter is various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario advanced drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now verichip i 'm not saying that other lifeforms do n't exist in the universe far from it and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas but this idea that there are little menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us historically there 's been the barbarians huns mongols pagans jews christians vikings black natives cannabals red natives mexicans germans nazis communists now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80 's the fact is that with known technology not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked they could quite easily pull the hoax off even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced albeit underground '' than most people can fathom what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised of which strieber has been front and centre at various times my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups in this book his '' is flimsey and suspicious for example why would n't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue thus not showing up on any mri ct etc and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body surely this would be child 's play for alien scientists why no major discussion or mention of the human military or nazi connection with abductions there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange fragments '' of memories that are slipping through various memory covers why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms why are some speaking english others german why is there a connection with deep underground bases and specifically antartica these are things strieber never mentions which i find curious my point is things are happening but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what and strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas
when the title of your book is confirmation the hard evidence of aliens among us '' it would probably be a good idea to produce some hard evidence this book is the loosest of innuendo the shakiest of suppositions and probably hurts more than helps the ufo movement the hard evidence '' the shards of foreign materials found in a few people are classified as alien even though not one of them is of a foreign substance not found in nature i love a good ufo tale but this book proves absolutely nothing and is n't even a provocative read whitley has completely milked the alien abduction genre and i 'm sure he 's not done it 's been too profitable
i bought this book for 3.00 at a clearance should have known then the author includes innumerable cases of encounters '' abductions '' implants '' and sightings '' but at the same time makes disclaimers about all of them leaving you feel that he is not sincere about what he is writing and wondering why he bothered with the book i 've read that his other books are much better this must have been one of the lost time episodes he describes during an abduction this is strictly for the mulders out there who have i want to believe '' posters on there office wall these are all the typical alien suspicions you have already read and left you laughing
this is the first ds book that i have read in about 20 years it made me realize why did i try again can i really find a book centered around a 70 year old male real i wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin i would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance coop only dates 20 something 's he has a 20 something porn star him that she is pregnant with his child this does n't bother his new girlfriend an early 30 's resident pediatrician who works in icu with preemies at all who tells him to have her get an abortion '' a bit too for me coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful sexy i had a hard time getting into this premise the way ds totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters every character is of course extremely wealthy even though several are hiding it most characters are extremely beautiful look many years younger than they are i realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for ds
i had not read danielle steel in several years i found the cottage to be shallow implausible and completely predictable i was very disappointed with this work
this is the worst most depressing piece of fiction i have ever read there is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration and after a while their actions just become inexplicable the author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book it starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of neil gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions additionally the characters ' motivations change like the shifting sands nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease what is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all unlike some of stephen king 's work ie the stand there is absolutely no redeeming thread here no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil it 's evil in evil evil surrounded by evil all i can say is that this book is ugly ugly ugly at least writers like joyce carol oats and joseph conrad 's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable the choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all i suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as i could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence i literally stopped and chose to never read this author 's work again it 's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist dave mckean who maybe has n't completely gone over to the dark side like neil has his association with dave mckean is the only reason i even the book and maybe a little because the title intrigued me but it 's unfortunate that the industry rewards clever '' works such as gaiman 's with undue praise i 've never so strongly disliked a book have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book well do n't believe the hype this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you
my initital impressions of 'american gods ' were nearly uniformly positive although i had not read any reviews previous i was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel but like a doomed traveler in fred pohl 's 'gateway ' the book never achieved '' the central storyline is further and further pushed off and often seems to occur on the sidelines gaiman 's prose is engaging and easy to slip into but i felt empty in the end without significant payoff or a true sense of journey those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by tim powers last call '' in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to gods
i dropped out of this one by about page 200. i have read and thoroughly enjoyed neverwhere and stardust so i was eager to read this book unlike the earlier works american gods failed to engage me i love to lose myself in a good book to feel like i 'm part of the story but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that 's going on around him as shadow is it tends to make the reader feel the same way i 'm sure if i hung in there it would have picked up a bit but i do n't like having to work so hard to turn pages life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there
everything is an echo '' ilan stavans wrote in the essay lost in translation to live is to plagiarize to imitate to steal '' and so he does the editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of authors under the common title 'the essential ' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry whose work can be somehow distilled but ilan stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential ' stavans only the 'echo ' i always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal stavans has been against latina writers such as ana castillo and sandra cisneros see 'form over content ' 41 stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by chicana writers to create their own respective worlds the reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book stavans ' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him octavio paz walter benjamin elias canetti lionel trilling writers stavans has invoked to 'explore ' his own identity as a male by his own admission stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity rather than in the assertion of a identity this is why he writes so brutally against chicana writers because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it the short stories in this book particularly show stavans at his most derivative imitating kafka while alluding to him
like so many of you i love stephen king i really do he has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker but hey we already had to read gerald 's game ! at least gerald 's story was n't very long however wolves of the calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring also like so many of you i do in fact plan to read all of king 's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons but knowing this knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell king puts on the menu should n't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence if you cut all of the fat from wolves you 'd be left with one tasty little steak perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine instead we have a book that simply does n't do anything you know from the what 's going to happen in the end and in king 's own words out of roland 's mouth that 's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes after a several hour investment simply do not pay off i was bored out of my f mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and i did n't even have frank muller as the reader to help me get through the journey on that note i truly hope muller is on the mend king well he 's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it but if cell a very mediocre book is the indication of where king 's going is the best of him behind us now
i suppose i 'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about ellis 's stylistic sloppiness i recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes jefferson 's message in the declaration as a recipe for anarchy '' and proceeds to note that a government which attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide '' yes joseph a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in is this what passes for lofty criticism these days i picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in and more fair to thomas jefferson i went in believing him to be a cold conniving man whose life was a long exercise in do what i say not what i do '' this book did nothing to change that impression if anything changed it was my opinion of ellis of whom i 'd had somewhat higher hopes his writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing jefferson 's worst characteristics in my book psychological agility '' is n't distinguished from hypocrisy it is hypocrisy the book 's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts i was once forced to read full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences
professor ellis is a very intelligent man but he plays fast and loose with the facts and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in american sphinx ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about jefferson but he does n't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our president if you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with sally hemings you must read douglass adair 's essay the jefferson scandals '' this essay is found in the book fame of the founding fathers essays by douglass adair published by norton sally hemings was the daughter of jefferson 's and sally 's lover was not but 's nephew his sister 's son that 's why jefferson never talked about the scandal '' because his close family relatives were involved however not the way ellis says the unfortunate fact is that ellis mentions douglass adair in american sphinx but he never mentions adair 's research which ellis can not reasonably be ignorant of on the alleged sally jefferson liason it 's obvious from american sphinx that ellis has read adair 's essays ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates thomas jefferson but he never tells us about that the well publicized dna test does not prove tj was the father of any of hemings ' children tj never fathered any children with hemings and ellis knows it ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point and on many other points of jefferson 's life too bad because he would otherwise have written a instead it 's a
this book does a great job of paralleling basic business concepts with monopoly game play this would work perfectly if business was conducted by four persons in your living room the book covers concepts including aggressiion opportunity maximizing odds and negotiation if you find these concepts new or intriguing then this is a great book for you i found it somewhat humorous and witty but not enough to recommend to friends i do find myself oddly excited about my next game of monopoly as i now have some insights on game strategy that i never knew or cared about before
this book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish was it trying to give tips on how to win at monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life in both cases it came up lacking the tips it gave were rather the stories it shared did n't really give any insight into how the game applies to business and to top it off it did n't not give accurate rules to the game for example the book said that you could n't collect rent while in jail so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game just like in life that 's a nice maxim to live by but you can collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative overall the book was very disappointing and i hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it
the was a good book and easy to read but i have never seen a published book with this many errors in it they are on almost every page titles out of place misspelled words errors in punctution etc you name the error this book has it the content was fine if a tad redundant but the reader quickly gets annoyed this book was rushed onto the shelf ! !
your book to me conveys false conclusions if our country 's could overcome such biases in their media to create our country then our current complaints of biased media are either unfounded or overblown since either 1 current media is less bias than in the past or 2 we will overcome the media bias as our forefathers did to do or create something as positive as they did when they created our country 1 the majority of our forefathers were directly or probably one generation away from the oppression either political religious or social class which drove them here in the first place despite the difficult journey their or recent knowledge of their oppression and their reactions to it trumped the old media 's propaganda ! they knew too much to be hornswoggled by media only newspapers and pamphlets then in essence they knew what they would not stand for regardless of what the media stated for they had lived it barely or parents had ! i would submit to you we would not have bought the administration 's nor biased media 's false assertions regarding saddam had we had war on our soil in recent memory we would have all known what war was and would not have made this decision '' so readily or cavalierly 2 how many of the colonists could read yes obviously the founders could but the average colonist had to depend on the educated founders or that class of folks to tell them the news and its ramifications which were translated through the founders ' own biases today folks get their facts '' from many news '' sources other than newspapers or the almost extinct pamphlet tv internet books etc the selection of which source is often a result of their ideology rather than in the past when they took what was available as far as source i would submit the lack of recent knowledge of oppression or lack of freedoms the lack of civic education heck ignorance no knowledge of history apathy and trust albeit misplaced contribute in my opinion to the increased harm the current biased media does to we the people and our country ! let 's face it the majority of us are used to walter cronkite not bill o'reilly of course depending upon one 's generation and their inherent credibility or not which of these people is more credible or stated another way which of these people has been caught in lies or scandals so no i do not agree with what i think are your false conclusions or dismissal of harm done by current biased media i believe the harm is immeasurable i believe it is more than unfortunate given it directly lead to an invasion based on lies all these years have passed since our country was founded and the press collectively has not improved or evolved in a positive way with any depth ergo the ease the current press slipped into bias mode rather the media has digressed into lies and obfuscation to the degree they have committed these acts the current media is totally complicit with the results a war which the majority feel we never should have embarked upon just to mention one glaring example ad nauseam ! i am more than disgusted over the media 's active participation through their blatant bias in all the negative things which have happened to our country in the last five years ! i am just as disgusted with any who would apologize for it minimize it or dismiss it all we the people ever want or deserve in this country is the pure facts untarnished by the prism of bias !
did danielle really write this it seems like it was written by an adolescent girl i thought it might get better but it never did i 'm glad this was a library book
i was very disappointed with the ending of this new danielle steel it seemed like a very long read with a very quick ending i have read every one of her books and have never been so disappointed with a story until now i would not recommend this to anyone
even though we in america have peace and a booming economy bill clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him a truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray before george bush was considered the worst president ever by so many he had fantastic approval ratings because he earned them he also led us through a war and a recession but many would just claim he was the cause for these problems bill clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and considers himself to be a wonderful president its a shame he will be remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent moral americans
wonderful example of how undisciplined muddled thinking can create unsound arguments based on invalid premises that yield conclusions that will confirm one 's biases perhaps in a book the author will prove '' that the world is flat an early mistake she declares that it is mostly false that stockholders fund major public corporations noting that shares trade in secondary markets accordingly she draws the conclusion that there is no reason that corporations should maximize the interests of stockholders and minimize the interests of shareholders and that it would be just as appropriate to put the interests of employees first in fact clear economic thinking reveals that successful corporations do make the interests of employees a high priority because a corporation with unhappy employees has difficulty retaining employees which makes for an unsuccessful company further when a corporation raises capital it often does so by means of a public offering of securities which is really an agreement between the corporation and the stockholders where the stockholders give the corporation money in exchange for the right to an ownership interest in the corporation whether the shares stay in the hands of the original purchaser or whether the purchaser sells them in secondary markets is not germain whoever holds the shares holds the right to the ownership interest which may yield value through appreciation sale or dividends if you think her argument that it would be equally appropriate for a corporation to maximize payments to employees and minimize the interests of stockholders just try this little exercise form a coproration and attempt to raise capital to run the corporation including to pay employees then tell the potential investors of your plan to minimize value to stockholders then count how many of these potential investors actually invest their money in your corporation hint if you guessed more than zero you 're too high
marjorie kelly stands heads above her comrades in shouting the old adage from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs '' from the father of wealth discrimination karl marx she pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism she is clearly in left field the fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today corporations are abiding to compliant ethics established by meddling government bureaucrats and no more free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them kelly and those who like this book should reread animal farm visit the von mises website or check economic books by carson hazlitt or sennholz
this book does all right for the writer who does not have the information already advice such as poor spelling and grammar puts you at a disadvantage '' really did i really need to waste my money on such a book to give me advice on such a wow i did n't know that SMILE she offers very obvious advice like what to do on tours and how to get publicized the chapter on media training television appearances are part of a book 's promotion '' hmm thanks for the great insight ! however for those who already know some things this book only glosses over what you really need to know i know i need to set up a mailing list for say a book signing event but she does n't actually tell you how to contact them properly and where do n't bother with this book get free information on the website by spending your own time googling i am author of legacy of fire and wind book i fires withi
it does n't take talent or smarts to arrange letters and typography into a lifeless mobius strip without story or characterization i ca n't believe anybody really has a satisfying experience reading this kind of empty posturing supremely shallow tripe
ummm started it put it down one of these days ill pick it up but you really need to devote a ton of time to get thru the upwards and downwards and backwards and forwards i dont know ill take steven king 's books over these any day
mark danielewski only revolutions pantheon 2006 mark danielewski wrote one of the best books of the past decade in house of leaves given that you knew his second novel six years in the making was going to be either the best or the worst book of 2006. it pains me to inform you that only revolutions has found its way quite firmly in the running for the latter category it is as solid a candidate for defenestration as i have come across in a good long while the book 's dust jacket provides the only semblance of a plot structure there is to be found here because it 's certainly not in the text which relies heavily on intentional misspellings and a poetic framework though let me stress this is in no way poetry to distract the reader from the fact that there is absolutely nothing beneath the trappings it 's writing upon which no actual consciousness has been imposed it 's possible to tease an event or two out of the muck every once in a while but it 's not worth putting up with the incredible stupidity of the language both in the intentional misspellings and the awful narrative voice in order to get to them there is a good deal of style here all of it annoying and a complete lack of substance horrible zero
i loved house of leaves its unconventionality its layers i could not stand this book make sure you understand this is a book of verse a long narrative poem and yes it rhymes i just could not get into it the language annoyed me the characters were not interesting to me was there a plot of some kind it did n't work for me which is really frustrating if you know what danielewski is capable of
i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several run on sentences with no punctuation i was determined to try though once i got used to the almost editing i was able to enjoy the story it is a challenge but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life i 'm not sure the effort was worth it though note to writers employ editors so that your story is n't lost due to hard to read prose ! it added nothing to the book to create a new style '' and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead
frustrated authors take note you can be published and you do n't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation sentence clarity story structure or grammar cormac mccarthy proves it eloquently with all the pretty horses '' had mccarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher who was either drunk or high or both who thought what the hell let 's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it i 'm sure people will buy it after all americans do n't care about grammar anyway '' i 'm not going to dive into the plot of the you can read it above this book falls short of one of the best in literature how they compare this guy to faulkner is beyond me the comparrison is an insult to faulkner and people who read books in general most fifth graders can write better more enthralling naratives
i sent this book back its basically the at the organization level it goes through characteristics of the entj organization for example my problem with it was that the people make the organization and the culture and unless all the same types of people are being hired or cloned and all the people in the org are primarily the particular type then the concepts fall apart the other thing that bugged me was that the leadership generally sets the tone for the organization so if the leader is a certain personality type then that will probably prevade the organization so there 's no need to look at the organization 's type but instead to look at leadership and see what type of they portend andthen work at that level to make change anyway i did n't find this book useful at all just another spin on myers brigg
after reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about very close minded and not open to any changes at the end you will be like whatever
the history of the making of the nancy drew books is fascinating and i did enjoy reading that part of this book however the author simply could not keep her point of view that the nancy drew authors and creators were modern feminists showing the great big male world what women could do back then when the facts simply did not support this point of view the author even says that the writers say they did n't think they were being pioneering or feminists yet the author tells us even though they say there were n't they are and rehak insists on it i ca n't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor too shared this slanted point of view so read this book for the history that part is fascinating but take all the feminism with a grain of salt mildred wirt benson is a fasincinating lady but her intention with nancy drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living she was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule as the author seems to imply
the back cover to this book was intriguing and captured me immediately the writing however was so plodding so inconsistent and so that it was painful to get through to the end this is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day i ca n't believe that this book made it past the editors in one paragraph jon katz tells how rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet and in the next he says that rose is too young to herd sheep in one paragraph he ca n't live without his wife she gives his very existence meaning and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to what was it again oh right herd sheep ! at one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he ca n't connect to and finally gives away and then ca n't stop visiting even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog and why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys there 's a reason jon ! if you care at all about literarure stay away from this book
jon katz creates a remarkable story in this series of books all apparently derived from his great love of dogs first his beloved yellow labs and then a gaggle of sheep herding border collies in the dogs of bedlam farm '' however he finds a way to turn this exciting and compelling story into pure drudgery an almost painful book to read katz continues to explore the limits of his relationships with his three dogs selling his upstate new york cottage buying an old abandoned farm property and abandoning his wife he adds a ram 15 ewes and 2 donkeys to the three collies and attempts to survive a brutal northern winter while training the dogs to herd and keeping all of the livestock alive and fed with mixed results his writing style is disjointed with constant but incomplete references to past parts of the story so that if you have not read previous books on his dogs orson you will have a hard time following along as the narrative enters the dark frigid winter months the story bogs down into a nauseating psychoanalysis of everything his relationship with his father with his sister and her personal demons with his dogs his feelings of insecurity with the farm the animals his new neighbors out in the country in the beginning i felt bad that his wife was being left out of all this excitement by chapter 12 it became apparent that she is the only sane one in the story as a dog lover i could n't have been more inclined to embrace this book but it was a huge disappointment
katz 's dogs of bedlam farm '' is a litany of katz 's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer katz does n't love dogs he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact like dog shows agility or herding trials he loves his dogs he loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate ny and stocks it with 16 sheep sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter ny winter he just has to have 16 sheep five would n't be enough apparently even though they 'd be much easier to care for than 16. dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife a wife that he says he loves but apparently not as much as his dogs if you 're getting the idea that i believe that katz loves his dogs as possessions you 'd be correct and of course as a source of income as he writes books about them and although katz fails to train two out of three of his border collies so much so in fact that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him after two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself katz glories in being known as the local dog man '' as someone who has owned trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years i see little to recommend in this book
stephen king is a master of suspense but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece ' i 'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel i found it much too long and the character development is extensive and wonderful but if i had to read about one more commitee meeting i was going to throw the book out the door near the book 's end i was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop the great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length in the end i understood why his editors cut it down i had much more fun reading salem 's lot
while the fear book and the depression book might be amongst the best books in their class they are still complete nonsense which does n't say much for this class of book i regret wasting my money i 'd sell them on but i think people particularly suffering people need protection from this autho
there are 8 sides of tape yet there is no table of contents and the tapes are not organized by topic you need to listen to them as though they comprised a novel it is so difficult to navigate to the topics you wish to listen that these tapes are a waste of time and money
i got this book used and thought it would be interesting to read after the fact of hrc 's moving on to other things without a doubt i believe the clinton administration was filled with lies deceit and well just plain politics this book is a discredit to thoughtful readers i 've only thrown away a handful of books in my life and this is one of them
i bought this biography because i have always been fascinated with hillary rodham clinton 's role in her husband 's administration i was hoping for an objective look at her contributions to policy instead this novel is full of acrimonious allegations and innuendo it seems that the author is completely unable to separate hrc the person from her politics this book is horribly slanted and i would not recommend to someone who truly desires insight into either one of the clintons
garbage the references to myself in the book are incorrect and any simple minded freshman student could have done more thorough research with that said i suspect the same amount of effort went into getting it right '' throughout the remainder of her book
not so much a biography as a collection of every rumor piece of gossip and regurgitated negative story ever written about hrc this biography '' reeks compare her citations in the book to the footnotes most are post 1990 articles and books written about the clintons milton never probes deeper to find out what the real story is she simply takes the previously published material as the final word according to milton nothing hrc has ever done from her ambition to win a dar award in high school to the health care debacle was ever for the proper reasons only to advance herself and her agenda '' in one rhetorical flurish milton weaves hrc 's activist work into tangled prose that references a communist front organization as if to imply that see hrc is a communist ! '' according to milton hrc is a lying duplicitous greedy icy virago and bad mother who demeans people out of her radar '' especially people who work for a living '' a woman who 's failed at everything she 's ever done with a sense of humor that consists only in insulting people oh ! and she snores ! on the other hand wilton is quick to come to the defense in a long paragraph of poor abused tammy wynette and her feminist songs another hard working woman hrc slammed in her ignorance of the common people the to the bias of the writer was the frequently used word taxpayer '' which almost becomes an outraged character in the book along with milton at times who ca n't help putting herself as we '' into her judgements maybe it will take 20 years before we can truly have an unbiased biography of either clinton this certainly is n't it and this review is not a plant but an outraged consumer wanting my money back !
what the listing does n't state is this book is written for children probably good for a 7 year old but had that been stated i would n't have purchased in the first place
i regret buying this book it 's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business the businesses '' the author has in mind are are for example selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them if you call having a lemonade stand a business then this book may pertain to you
this book is summarized in a single sentence be a good teacher '' all the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph not a book and even then every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down the only people that should be interested in this are those in administration for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric then again they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers
i was very dissappointed that the book itself was of very poor quality maybe the recepies are good but the way they were presented in the book they did not invite the reader to try them out the photos were all about patti labelle and her friends not about the recepies or cooking a cookbook should contain colorful inviting photos of the various dishes
strangely unsatisfying i distinctly felt that the book was more the writer 's attempt to heal than a piece of literary work heche shares much of her oddball therapy work theories of her case and memories of abuse in her utterly childhood but strangely enough reveals little of her self i felt i was pushed into the psychiatrist 's own chair not allowed to be merely a reader or in the best case of autobiography a kind of temporary confidante and friend i got ta hand it to her it took some guts to own up to some of this psychotic episode under influence of ecstasy for one and i am sorry for her suffering as a child but perhaps she should have paid me to read her unsavory chunk of insanity
maybe my expectations were too high based on the reviews i found most of the information in this book to be news items also anyone that follows technology in the news will not find much insight into this book the book is an overview of how the younger generation uses technology in their social lives play and work if you are not very familiar with the internet and do n't watch the news this book would be worthwhile however anyone who uses the internet and keeps up on the news wo n't get much out of it
eww ! i read this book because it was recommended in a woman 's magazine obviously it was a paid review boring unbelieveable poor character development i did n't care about the characters and the story was predictable this is the only book by norah roberts i have ever read and i have no reason to want to read others if you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels perhaps you will like montana sky too although it is a step down from the worst romance novel i ever read i read the entire book i kept waiting for it to take off do n't buy this book do n't even waste your time borrowing it from the library it really is that bad
line by line the writing is superb ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important but here may be the problem with id the constant shift to describing everything in the narrator 's line of vision confuses my sense of what 's relevant every other page is a distraction from something i was n't sure about to begin with
from the remarks at this site people either love this novel or hate it i hated it i hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about mfa program writing in the last 30 years the emphasis is entirely on style forget story forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere some of this thinking goes back to henry james some of it goes back to virginia woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits like wells ' the time machine the first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom frank bascombe is trying to sell a property it 's brilliantly written in fact it 's so brilliantly written that i had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life his loves and the region of the country he inhabits this book has no driving plot in fact it 's an arbitrarily chosen conceit what happens on july in the life of one guy it 's not james joyce 's ulysses nor is it trying to be but every thought this man has is in this book and none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person any perso should pick up the book indeed that seems to be the crux i read this book because it was by richard ford a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere you must read this book they said so i did and i consider it an extraordinary waste of my time to be sure this is a judgment call but i 'm allowed to make it every reader is allowed to make that call but i know i 'm in the minority in this this book is supposed to be one of the greatest american novels of the last 25 years but will it be so in another 25 years are novels now only to be interior monologues which virginia woolf preferred and said so in her essay modern fiction '' perhaps our values are changing perhaps the mfa programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story but what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism wherein the author writes at length putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we 're supposed to what applaud it i believe that the authors we 'll remember will be the natural storytellers i do n't think richard ford is one of them but man he sure can write
i like reading i am a literature snob i put down poorly written novels even though i ca n't write well myself ! but i think i 've met my match in this novel i recognize the style is something unique but i just could n't grasp the rhythm i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down i really want to be in the group that appreciates this plitzer prize novel but i do n't make the cut however i 'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because i just could n't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring man whom i would't enjoy spending a with at all i 've persistantly struggled through 180 pages but now will surrender !
this volume is abridged it says in the introduction that it is only of the original i have not read the work but i 'm going to wait until i do n't have some editor telling me what i do n't need to know ! i 'll go to gibbon himself for that ! she who is no longer the angel of musi
historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of byzantium think of only what the labeling byzantine '' means today if you want to know more about byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by sir steven runciman
this review is of the mueller edition published in 2005 by modern library simply the book is defective the pages tear out of the spine i thought it was a and returned for an exchange and had the same problem i returned it again and instead bought the 2003 edition modern library mueller which is not as thick it has fewer larger pages the spine holds together as it should the problem with the 2005 edition is the spine is so thick because the pages are smaller the perfect binding seems to fall apart probably a fault of the printer i dont know if they are all like that but the 2003 edition is imo exactly the same just not as thick and easier to open and read
do not buy this book it is one huge sales pitch for all of the other junk they are selling books games dvds no wonder they are so wealthy they are getting rich on selling all of their nonsense which tells you to buy some more nonsense ! they make a few good points but those points are easily understood buy reading the free articles on yahoo finance by kiyosaki your money will be better invested if you stick it under your mattress
please do yourself a favor and do not buy this book it is redundant nonsense this is the best marketing book i have read in years yes that is right marketing my book yaddayaddayadda says this my show is about this or my game teaches this '' these two have no intention of helping people other than taking money from them in order to tell them how to peel a banana if you want financial literacy read books like contemporary financial management finance for dummies or if it is real estate you love learn about appraisal real estate finance single and analysis and investment feasibility take their advice and educate yourself by investing in yourself not in scams
i have read all of kiyosaki 's books and there are several that are outstanding i like trump 's earlier books better however this book was just terrible if you have read anything by either of the two it is really a disappointment for the the two of them to collaborate on this one it appears they took excerpts from their other books and used cliches all over the place it was poorly written offered little new advice or foresight and was a major disappointment they spent too much time just talking about how they decided to write the book save your money for retirement and buy an earlier book of either of the two
the content of this book should have been the informercial for this book although i understand the need for self promotion book goes way overboard everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens ' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race hey robert ! we know about your other books and your game donald we know about your show its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap ! ! ! ! honestly if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years this book is a big waste of time and money ! !
this is great if you have all the time and money to spend on hors d'oeuvres i would not buy it again but it was fun to look at
what a bunch of high school hallway gossip ! the author does not know the difference between white and albino ! the 'genetics ' discussions on color which includes people chickens horses and dogs all of it suspect and mutts purebred dogs are total claptrap ! i confess i could n't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies ' what a waste of my having read those parts i can not believe anything that went before or that follows not that i 'm reading any further how is a author allowed to put such uneducated 'information ' into print and now she 's influenced readers a terrible situation publisher where are your reviews shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published !
the first sentence in the book is people who are n't autistic always ask me about the moment i realized i could understand the way animals think '' it should have been people who are n't autistic always ask me about the moment i somehow got the noton that i could understand the way animals think '' there 's no proof in this book no good evidence just grandin 's anecdotes and speculations noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think the book does offer many clear simple descriptions of scientists ' research so if you do n't know anything about animal research these descriptions could be a good place to start
honestly i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive the author 's main point although interesting seems to me like it would fit into an essay also the particular print of the book that i purchased has a dog on the cover i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior instead i felt i little duped most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person or anedoctal accounts of my friend 's dog fido one day did this '' i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population i mean the author does n't even have a dog ! ! i suspect that i who have had a lifelong history with dogs have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author i do n't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there now if your thing '' is cows get this book !
hormones are not all they are cracked up to be they have serious dangerous impacts on the human body please if you are going to try these do your homework first a growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects some do n't make it out the other side i am one of the lucky ones i survived the blood clots in my legs and two illnesses connected with use of natural '' progesterone since that time i have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones i hope this information will be helpful to someone else too please safeguard your health no one else is going to do it for you
suzanne somers apparently has no use for modern medical science especially as a survivor of breast cancer although of a very early stage she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones recent studies have shown that women who were taking hrt for protection from heart problems actually had more problems than normal menopausal women this is an unbelievably destructive horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously being skinny is not more important than being alive if you want to get the real scoop on hormones talk to a doctor at an academic medical center in other words one that is n't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain and see what she or he has to say chances are excellent that you 'll be told to avoid them at all cost look at it this way are you going to put your very life in the hands of suzanne somers i 'm sure she 's a very nice person it 's just that she has no medical training whatsoever writing from an comprehensive cancer
if your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power then maybe this plan is right for you but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy ie nuts avocados fish oil even butter gasp ! he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell ! i 've never heard of this phenomenon i refuse to believe it and physiologically it does n't make sense the only reason i gave this book one star is because of his advocation to whole foods '' which are unprocessed contrary to what one anti ornish '' reviewer said it 's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives many people in europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two and that is a good thing ! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives the better off you are eating it long story short if your protein needs are n't large and you do n't have an insulin sensitivity problem then you may lose fat and become a bit healthier on this diet otherwise just make an effort to eat foods in moderation it 's as simple as that ! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible no one ever needs those and in my opinion they are n't hard to live without and do n't eat any more than you need to to reach satiety
i should know by now that anything oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy but this tome pegs the kumbayaometer i do n't know what was worse morrie 's trite godless and advice to be nice to those we love '' or mitch albom 's profiteering off a friend 's gruesome als death what is it with america that we flock to this shallow i 'm 're okay amoral and treat it as profundity is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our which is the real god of this age as a sidebar what is it with oprah and her ilk that a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic safe to say anything written by the tirelessly albom should be avoided and anything the big o pushes should be rejected out of hand by the way i read this drivel in a barnes and noble while i waited for a phone call one afternoon if you must read it get it at a library and keep the money from getting to mitch
i 've read a lot of stephen king 's work and loved most of it but 'firestarter ' was a big letdown ! it 's not quite in the 'abomination ' category of 'from a buick 8 ' but at least king could blame that one on his car accident this one is probably only about as good as 'the tommyknockers ' the premise is great but once it gets away from 'andy and charlie on the run ' and becomes 'the life story of tom rainbird ' it goes downhill very quickly ! not to knock king too much but as this books goes along it seems obvious that sk was losing interest either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason and wanted to 'explore ' the supporting characters more or simply because this book came out fairly early in king 's career when he was known to partake of certain 'substances ' which he later swore off ! worth reading only if you really want to read every sk novel otherwise just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one with the exception of the two mentioned above surpasses 'firestarter'
on its own merits stone 's book deserves only one star but because it has brought socrates to the attention of a wider audience than he otherwise would have it gets a second star maybe stone learned attic greek in order to write this book and maybe he did n't nothing stone wrote in this book required analysis of primary sources or any depth of knowledge of attic greek in contrast with the truly scholarly work on socrates which often turns on the evaluation of subtle stylistic and linguistic evidence in the ancient sources stone 's methods are those of the advocate the special pleader and the polemicist which of course is what he was for his entire journalistic career he was clearly not a scholar in spite of his pretensions he would have fit in quite well with the clever sophists socrates had so much fun arguing against and so little respect for perhaps stone had a grudge against socrates because socrates would never have taken stone seriously had the two ever met socrates would no doubt have taken stone apart just like he did everyone else he encounters in plato 's dialogues the idea that socrates could have used a free speech '' defense at his trial in ancient athens is preposterous the athenian democracy quite frequently fined exiled or put to death its citizens for the flimsiest of reasons one has only to read thucydides to learn this there was no first amendment in ancient athens athenian law was whatever a jury said it was on any given day it was for good reason that pure democracy as practiced by athens developed such a bad reputation that it has never been seriously tried since a good antidote to stone 's screed is the paper by gregory vlastos called the historical socrates and athenian democracy '' which appears in his book socratic studies '' vlastos also wrote a critical review of stone 's book in the new york review of books it should be noted that vlastos identified himself as being leftist in his personal political views but did n't let that interfere with his scholarship and i doubt that he ever let kgb agents take him out to lunch
the author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book the book is written at the grade reading and intellectual level which accounts for its popularity the book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading an analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world there is a total lack of academic rigor the author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself what is worse is the absent material the author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion
i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the in a row preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and ugh and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom ' mentality in the end i think if a person is from a household respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too even ones personality and this book does n't send a message about love as much as 'i own you ' i like 'mama do you love me ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love moon ' by margaret wise brown however is by far my children 's all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly 'normal ' family take it grain of salt
hi there coming from an oracle and sql server world not alot changes really between the enterprise class dbmss many of the same best practice principals apply unfortunatly this book falls well short of the mark the book only glances over tuning with no thorough look into the startup parameters for example indexing stats collection etc is also very poor and there are no discussions on internals to save us all from reading the code ! the replication chapter was ok but i would seriosly suggest that the modelled replication model for load balancing is a really bad idea and a nightmare for a prod dba from oracle or sql you will be very disappointed
maxwell 's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate however i do n't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is that 's what this book came to be one long repetitive obvious definition for leadership i did n't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he 'd already said as a woman reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders the few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched mother teresa and princess diana a nun and a princess how many women in business are either of those where are the examples strong successful inspiring female business and sports leaders i also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome what i felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one 's leadership skills he suggests training but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that are n't going well a great leader 's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict i also strongly disagree that a positional leader is n't necessarily a true leader a positional leader is in nature a leadership role what is n't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead one of the elements of this book i did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read other than that i do n't feel any more prepared now than i did prior to reading this book
publisher 's weekly indicates that readers may be disappointed by the solution and that 's a kind way to put the ending tying the savoy hotel desk clerk who only happened to witness the first death back into the heart of the whole murderous mechanism that yanks the long arm of coincidence right out of its socket in a mystery i like at least a sporting chance to spot the murderer and the mechanism here no such luck what happened to the fabled british sense of fair play
to put it simply freedom evolves is a philosophical failure with as many holes as a hollywood movie i give the book one star for effort for the attempt to get philosophy to the masses and for pure entertainment purposes but i subtract four stars because the premise is yet another arrogant attempt by a philosopher to gain a piece of the philosophical pie one that i feel was eaten a long time ago with mere crumbs remaining for contemporary thinkers dennett does not by any stretch get a crumb for this one despite the myriad and frightened attempts to get around the harsh yet incredibly simple reality and logic of determinism i have yet to see any valid arguments by any philosopher to even begin to disprove it i 'll go so far as to agree that we perceive an illusion of free will due to the individuality in character of each human being based upon one 's initial genetic programming and thereafter one 's environmental programming but that 's as far as it can possibly go we 're still bound by cause and effect just like every single other thing in the universe alive '' or not to think or state otherwise is merely another case of human and arrogance and therefore outright ignorance or in dennett 's case opportunism to boot the potential proof of parallel universes in physics will still have no bearing on the issue and evolution as dennett attempts it works more against his arguments than for them recommended if you enjoy pop philosophy for clever entertainment only otherwise with all the logical holes in it you could use the book to strain your spaghetti
james cramer is responsible for much of what occurred during the tech bubble he was a cheerleader for the tech boom and now says that others got screwed he was doing the screwing ! this is hypocrisy at its best from his near firing at goldman to the collapse of his own company is down 90 plus from its ipo price cramer is a genius at cashing in on his own failures do not touch this book with a 50 foot pole
i have always been intrigued by when i found this smallish book i decided to read what he had to say about the market crash i hoped to find some deep insights from a man who is a wall street insider i am very disappointed with the book you probably will learn more about what caused the bubble to burst by reading newspapers and magazines then you would from this book the material in the book is very superficial and the only thing that stuck was that he was shamelessly using it as a means to advertise his web site and alert service if you have loads of money that you want to waste please mail it to cramer at least then you will save a tree
to learn what cramer knows about recent swindles now after the fact or what financial products cramer sells '' read this book cramer does a great job of beating you down then offering to be your personal savior so this is what i had to say about cramer a year ago and now i 'm a total cramer junkie his radio show is the best source of timely unbiased practical information i have found in 20 years of investment and it 's free jim is right most of the time but he also is the first to admit when he has made a mistake thank you jim for giving me the courage to fire my broker improve my investment performance and save in fees
flynn offers up a if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those politicians how the real world '' works meanwhile flynn 's politicians the majority of whom are democrats seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a thriller i 'm still looking

i received this after my trip and was told i would be receiving a return authorization but i have not received it
this book was difficult to use when trying to translate an italian word there is no single lookup but rather chapters on various topics i waded through these chapters when looking for a word but was never able to find any of the words i was looking for these were frequently seen words also for example you would think the chapter on driving would include frequently seen road signs but it doesn't
i found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what i was looking for the small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
in laundry it smells like a locker room is not really useful '' under paying for your meal '' what if i wash the dishes '' the italians will think you have lost your mind ! ! ! one does not say i am full '' at the end of an italian meal this book must have been written for a kid on his first back packing trip to italy these stupid remarks take up too much space and much more useful phrases could have been included
tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts '' or scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea '' provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author tim cohen has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture '' if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture '' based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period '' series see prophecy house 's web site prophecyhouse dot com for details on these items
i had to read whose trade organization for a graduate level political science course the books is perfect for those arguing on the side of the debate and may be somewhat useful for those who argue for limited or slow globalization reforms unfortunately the book has clouded and conflated issues subscribes to fallacious reasoning and blatantly ignores empirical evidence whether she is pushing an ideological viewpoint or ignorant of reality is another question that i wo n't there is absolutely no evidence that suggests more free trade creates poverty evidence suggests the opposite the real income of third world labor as happened in the first world in the century is on the rise not decline yes there is an inequality '' in this rise but global society is rising as a whole to suggest this inequality is wrong or bad is to make the assumption that the wealth of the world is a zero sum game which it is not looking at relative gains in economics is a fallacious way of viewing the world there is also no evidence that suggests that more economic openness also known as economic freedom reduces democracy as a matter of fact the overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that the more open a society is the more civil and political freedoms citizens enjoy countries who suppress economic trade tend to be far less democratic but most often tyrannical dictatorships the author seems to subscribe to an idea that democracy is defined by action a government can take specifically action in regard to the political majority she believes that increasing globalization more importantly classic liberalism for non political and econ types this means free trade and limited government will reduce democracy by reducing governments ability to take action to solve problems '' or through accountability to the people the reality is again the opposite in no way can anyone construe a political majority as being an example of governmental accountability this is what classic theorists described as a tyranny of the majority where a group votes themselves the wealth of the nation at the expense of the minority in modern times such notions of majority rule led to segregation discrimination and everyone 's favorite nazi germany who by the way were elected to lead germany democratically who seriously wants to argue that democracy is defined by majority rule she also confuses government action with government sovereignty yes governments will lose sovereignty over economic policies through globalization but this by no means demonstrates a loss of accountability to the people again she is conflating government action with the will tyranny of the majority and assuming this is accountability the fact is that the policy preferences she desires produce the results she hates governments who retain the ability to economically discriminate set up protections give a great deal of power to the capital owners in that society they are effectively able to protect their capital from outside competition at the expense of the domestic consumer who must now pay high prices for goods at the international level foreign producers find themselves restricted as to where they can import and as a result labor in those countries find themselves unable to develop and pull themselves up from poverty corporations learn to use government intervention to their own advantage at the expense of society she also operates under the fallacious assumption that corporations seeking their own advantage under a free market will reduce democracy and as the anti globalization protestors like to scream a tyranny of profits '' or rule by corporation that simply is n't the case nor possible competition between corporations will increase greatly reducing any political power you think they wield now because voluntary transaction is the rule of the game for free trade corporations will only be able to attract profits by getting customers to purchase products or services with competition in the mix each company must do their best to attract customers by being the best having the highest quality the lowest price good or a combination of these or other issues the result is simple corporations are accountable to the people because their survival depends on it ! those corporations who are unable to give the people want the want in the market either die out or innovate and try again furthermore limited governments under free trade wo n't be able to take action to give corporations special privileges special privileges that make special interests '' possible i find it absolutely silly to argue that corporations are taking advantage of everyone and then follow it up with an argument for more government intervention i find it even sillier to want to help the third world poor and then argue economic protection for first world industries and agriculture from weak and developing third world industries and agriculture the problem is not the wto it is globalization that is maturing in a world that still accepts an archaic form of global trade mercantilism scholars like these conflate with free and assume all the negative aspects of protectionism a mix of voluntary and coercive transactions will occur under a system of free trade voluntary transaction mercantilism and free trade are polar opposites and neither are necessary conditions for globalization that is globalization can occur under either i believe the on balance will only be positive for the world if free trade is the rule set which is what the wto pushes mercantilism socialism communism will only make poverty worse stagnate economies restrict innovation exploit the consumer and result in a very privileged elite at the expense of society overall the book is incorrect in its assessment of opening trade and reducing trade restrictions the results of which will not be more poverty or a reduction in democracy the book is the result of years of fallacious reasoning clouded facts and illogical arguments i own this
the basic ideas underlying this book that people should follow their dreams work at what they enjoy do n't blindly follow the crowd are unquestionably good ideas but the expressions of these ideas as espoused by simmons in this book should give every parent pause some examples in the introduction he talks about african rituals such as putting a child 's hand in a bag of ants as a ritual of becoming an adult he then proceeds to directly equate this with the 'ritual ' of attending school his intended argument is that one should not consider oneself a 'bad person ' because of poor performance in school feeling good about poor performance might be the politically correct thing to do these days but i do n't think it 's the message most parents want their child to receive from a book such as this a couple of pages later a list of facts is presented that show that failure in school is not a 100 reliable predictor of failure in life true enough but all this is presented in a context that seems to say its ok not to study that its ok to fail if you do n't like school he further goes on to say that an education is becoming less and less valuable over time as evidenced by the idea that a high school education used to set one apart then a college degree was required and this transition from the respected to the expected is now occurring with the master 's degree '' similarly internships have become devalued '' as more and more people get them i could not disagree more in today 's environment where people compete globally more and more education is required just to complete among many other similar examples one in particular stands out in chapter 12 the case of jubair chowdhury of a company named sybess technologies a web address is given but the company apparently no longer exists is presented chowdhury decided that in order to save time and get into business right away he would drop out of school get a focus on his business for a few years and then go on to college '' the author says that he like s this path because it bypasses paying dues high school '' while i may be wrong my guess is chowdhury probably now wishes he had stayed in school there is some good information in the book about networking the value of compund interest and other basic concepts however most of these can be found in many other books that do not proclaim themselves to be extreme '' i bought this book with high expectations that it would give my teenage son some good ideas about life and living i was very disappointed this is pushing young people in the wrong direction yes entrepreneurship and extreme endeavors '' are vitally important to the future of this country and we need more people to adopt these attitudes but this book is on the wrong tack when it disavows the value of education i am having my son read the seven habits of highly successful people '' instead
it amazes me that in this day and age a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book and which uses an maid and a korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast which uses time travel merely as a conceit with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships it obviously does n't have any impact on the eternally horny henry and claire can be taken seriously this book is a hillary duff movie cliches the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes racist black maids and asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes stereotypes hiding behind a love makes the family '' veneer this book was barbara cartland hiding behind chip kidd style cover art no doubt anne hathaway will star in the film
so very boring i gave up halfway in i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time my sister liked it though
i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion while it was unique it was too hard to get into i also really hated the story it was also too confusing to follow to strange to enjoy and to boring to care i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club the reivews by the way in the club were some loved it the rest of us hated it there was no i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors i 'm not sure who else would like it
when i read the reviews i thought the book would talk about foreplay i ca n't tell the story but i bought it for my husband after a week he told me he had read some i was n't getting any good response so i asked him for the i read it in less than an hour and i was so disappointed my heart sank the book mostly encourages on being a closed union to take care of everyday chores equally we have that already we 're like perfect roomates get along great everyday chores get happily distributed by themselves between the both or us but he keeps thinking that if he 's a good husband meaning all that it 's in this book then he only needs to be in the mood '' may be once a month and just go silently and finish within a minute i 'm sorry this book did n't help my pathetic life ray romano inawomansbody
king certainly lends a to this collection of noir writing and procedurals but i believe he created something a little too far outside the readership 's expected genre for this series the setting and characters are recognizable now trite staples of his beloved maine coast and he works at bringing their down east '' mannerisms to life with language that rings of bert i '' lobstermen i was n't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen 's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach and the ending well um the ending is definitely an king cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story wo n't appeal to many readers yep you got that right stephen no gunplay no boozers no saucy dames no no slangy patter no real satisfaction for me i suggest hard crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the from the past
this was the first hard case publication book that i have tried it wo n't be the last but i was hardly impressed with king 's story i do n't so much mind having a story with no ending i got the point even without the author 's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work but could n't king have given more of a mystery that is after all what is expected of a book i ca n't believe that i was asking too much instead i was treated to 178 pages of welcome to maine ! ''
you ca n't write a mystery without a solution and call it pulp '' or noir '' in my book those of you who are fans of king 's writing will find this readable but hardly enjoyable those who are not would do well to stay away we 're halfway through the book before we 're even introduced to the mystery '' and we 're finished the book before we 're told that there 's no solution to it and worst of all none of this seems to bother the downeast characters narrating the tale
i must admit i am not kings biggest fan i like the way he writes characters but for years i have n't been able to put my finger on why i do n't like his books after reading the colorado kid i realized what it was king is a lazy writer he can tell a good story but he does n't follow through his typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk bleh you can tell when he is done with a story it just ends this book is no exception the story rambles through the mouth of a old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes king tells the story he does n't show it i kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin but it never did and the ending ! someone his editor agent family or friends tell king that mysteries are supposed to be resolved he does n't resolve this mystery that was the only reason other than the fact that i had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do that kept me reading i got to the end and i swear i almost tossed the book while on the plane there is an after word trying to justify his ending i did n't get past the first sentence authors do n't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something if i could take away all the stars on this book i would even one star is one too many
i was terribly disappointed with this king release could a creative writing student done better perhaps it was by far the worst published work i 've ever read it was unreadable throughout the entire first chapter i waited for a plot to be formed the characters were choppy and the story went nowhere the book seemed to be published on his name alone i have been disappointed in king for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch i am a long time fan i began reading him in grade and the last good book i read written by him was hearts in atlantis
i was at the airport getting ready to fly out to cali and i found this book in the airport gift i thought what a stroke of luck i had getting a stephen king title at such a juncture i 'm a huge fan despite the fact that i started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed i was sorely disappointed much ado about nothing would be an overstatement
the author had all the elements for a good except for one thing the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery i find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as bag of bones and the stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict a body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body we learn the man was from colorado but very little else if the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened i would recommend a mary higgins clark mystery in place of this boo
the amazon description says vol boxed set hardcover that is all true what they do n't tell you is that there are actually six volumes the box in which it comes is clearly marked volumes of six '' that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used if you have volumes and you are looking to complete the set this book is for you if you are looking for the complete set look elsewhere
i disliked this book so much that i had to put it down frequently first of all the book is laid out in an illogical manner with information spread out over chapters called day 1 day 2 week 1 week 2 month 1 month 2 etc if you want to read all the information on a particular topic you wo n't find it in one place and that can be frustrating secondly becker 's attitude is once a diabetic always a diabetic '' she leaves little hope that by dieting and exercising you can return your body to a normal state even if your diabetes is n't severe this is in contradiction to what many doctors say becker seems jaded to me and is obviously tired of dealing with her own diabetes and her negativity is very evident in the book she does n't understand the power of suggestion to help or hinder people and since she does n't have any faith in the human body to regenerate itself once your beta cells are gone they 're gone ! ! ! she conveys this hopelessness to the reader her sense of humor is laced with irony and reflects her negative attitude and she uses humor to pander to the fears of her readers she seems to think that all her readers are in a state of shock '' from their diagnoses throughout the section about taking blood sugar readings she kept saying ouch '' as if in sympathy with the reader even though modern blood sugar meters are mostly painless the pandering can become irritating to a reader with a more mature attitude having said all that there is nonetheless a great deal of information in the book but to get it all you have to ward off her negative bullets with your magic bracelets and that may be difficult for people who are new to diabetes i do n't recommend this book
i 'm an avid reader of history as well as processing a degree in the subject so imagine my surprise when after receiving this book from a friend of mine for christmas i read the erroneous account of the children 's crusade of 1212. i had done research on this topic so i was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years if he had he would have realized that there were actually two crusades one consisting of mainly french people led by stephen of cloyes who when told to turn back by king philip ii did so that ended that crusade the other one led by a shepherd from germany named nicholas led a group across the alps into italy some left for home while others continued on to rome it 's interesting to note that in rome many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these children '' were either too old or because they were pregnant perhaps until relatively recently people believed in the children 's crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles like chronica albrici monachi trium fontium which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred rather than relying on more contemporary sources nor did they realize that the latin word pueri '' used in the chronicles can have several meanings such as unmarried men rather than children in the final analysis you just ca n't rely on books like these to really teach you history the best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it if only the author had bothered to check the history channel 's own account of the children 's crusade on their website or perhaps read the excellent paper done by peter raedts in the journal of medieval history or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia the book gave two pages to this event and sadly got it completely wrong for this gross oversight i am compelled to give it one star readers of history never just believe what you read verify
ann coulter is god 's gift of literature ! in godless the church of liberalism she once again has published a book that is so accurate so exposing and so genius ! she beautifully and intelligently exposes how liberalism is against everything that america stands for and exposes how liberals claim to be tolerant of all peoples yet they hate christianity our troops and america esp middle america she is probably the most brilliant author of our time if more people would read her books americans would be more educated about the disgusting and disgraceful truth about liberals and liberalism of course since the release of her book liberals like joe maguire who have a brain the size of a peanut are once again acting like the whiny little babies that they are they ca n't stand the fact that she is so popular and that what she says is so true ! politicians such as teddy the swimmer john kerry dick turbin scary reid and nancy liberal elitist douchebag pelosi should be thrown in jail for treason against this country they enjoy seeing our troops dying everyday and they want them thrown in jail for protecting america the modern democratic party actually wants the terrorists to win the war its too bad that liberals are decades out of tocuh with real america they are still living in a mindset and they ca n't seem to get out of it they just dont realize that america is a conservative country who hates liberals like them god bless ann coutler and her art ann for president
having read much of ann coulter 's book godless '' i was impressed with her energy but dismayed by her hyperbole her basic themes about the godlessness of american liberals are right on target but she unfortunately goes way over the top in some of her examples and analogies therefore i thought it would be interesting to check out one or more of the response books engendered by her bombshell being in a bookstore i picked up brainless '' to see if the liberals had any good response to coulter 's assertions sadly the author of this book named it after himself as he is clueless about how to go about writing an effective rebuttal the entire book is one long series of ranting attacks that resemble the gruntings of a pig maguire starts out by indicating that if you are part of less that 20 of the american population who is white male conservative and therefore bigoted you probably wont want to read his book '' it goes downhill from there maguire 's unwitting accomplishment is that he has proved coulter right in his case liberals are completely clueless
the '' on brainless '' is that one has to be brainless '' to take time to read coulter 's writings and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them yes it is mildly interesting to learn of coulter contradictions eg bashes the elite then takes on harriet miers partly because she did n't go to an elite law school and i believe everything i say '' most of what i say i say to amuse myself and amuse my friends '' and then there are the infinite number of brainless coulterisms '' and unsupported assertions eg public schools have more sex scandals per year than catholic priests thirty times more '' liberals lie about the science on research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos '' i 've never seen people enjoying their husbands ' deaths so much '' on the other hand maguire really does n't have that much to say that is interesting ! on the other hand if you had n't figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with ann coulter this book wo n't help save your money and your time
wow this pitiful attempt is exactly what ann coulter has been talking about since slander '' including the belief that showing an unflattering picture of someone actually proves that they 're stupid and their ideas are evil clearly all the visceral hatred posing as content is the intellectual and psychological equivalent of putting ones hand over ones ears and chanting la la la '' except it involves a mind boggling level of hatred hatred of hearing what you know is true and thus do n't have the means to logically debate this necessitates so called progressives '' need to destroy coulter before her wisdom and insights which none of these authors could hope to equal destroy their world and priviliges
joe maguire never takes on any of ann 's remarks and so called lies he just babbles on endlessly about how much he really hates her that 's it that 's the whole book ! the best thing about this book is that it got joe maguire fired from reuters ! now he 'll have some time to think about why it 's wrong to lie maybe he can even find some time to polish up on his goose stepping
this is a great concept for a three book series but after this first book i felt unsatisfied with the character development and predictable plot mariah stewart did a great job of writing though the book was n't that suspenseful maybe i 've just been reading too much lately the relationship between mara douglas and aiden shields was n't fully developed i would have liked a few more scenes where they get to know each other or something just to show the chemistry between the two i found that seriously lacking in this book if you want an easy read get a used copy of this book but definitely do n't pay full price i 'm not going to bother with the other two in the series this one did n't make me care enough to finish the series
unfotrunately shantaram did not grab my imagination at all nor did i find it emotionally satisfying i realize shataram is meant to be a kind of bollywood story over the top flowery cliched etc but the bollywood movies i 've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying despite their soppyness etc shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story
most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense there is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category she also repeats herself constantly the book could have been about half as long if she did n't rehash the same points over and over this is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money the religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive as well
the only book i 've ever read that i tore up and threw in the trash when i was finished if this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there 's something seriously wrong with the is a tragic sad grotesque disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world when a child is damaged it is never uplifting whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes this book is sickening do n't buy it ! ! ! there are no animals only pain and death
this had some great moments better understanding of animal behavior the debate between different religions but the only way i could finish it was by speed reading it 's claim to be a story that will make you believe in god was the most unbelievable part where did that even enter into the book pi was spiritual and loved god but there was n't anything that made this survival story make you believe in god more that the next
are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better of course if his models were worth more than the paper they 're written on mandelbrot would n't have to write books like this because he 'd be cleaning out everyone else 's wallets on the stock market in particular if it 's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative but the fact is mandelbrot does n't know anything that countless other traders do n't already know so instead mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on wall street but i am glad i read this book having seen mandelbrot 'on tour ' a few years ago i developed a strong prejudice against him but reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified he can never just state a fact instead he always has a to phrase it as my work shows that '' or i demonstrated that '' even if he makes the same claim again and again if he can try to take credit for other people 's work he 'll do so he even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the levy distribution as the distribution the most egregious example of has to be the caption to a picture of the set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'everest ' of this set and received fields medals for this work the implication of course being that mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit disgustingly he does n't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians one time i criticised mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he ca n't be all bad but in this book mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system astonishing ! i think it 's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it 's not completely valueless but i found the discussion of multifractal time methods which make up a large part of the book to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless i work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time but it does n't mean i have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces it just means i know how to fool the eye
no real analysis unsubstansiated too much hype and self praise nothing more than an average trader knows already by experience just a interesting observation no rigorous proof of no real practical use
mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around they might well describe the markets better than the capm but do they predict better is the key question william sharpe who invented '' the capm makes this very point on his home page the capm captures risk and return albeit imperfectly but what does mandelbrot capture certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use he wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application something for good and bad the capm has the normal curve is with the lognormal distribution the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week even the capm is widely used in corporate risk assessment ditto the imperfect black scholes model which allows us to predict accurately enough for our purposes the price of a european call and thence a put etc etc although improvements have been have been made it is like mother nature unless the improvements give us better predictability they are probably not worth the effort because the bs model gave us that predictability it is widely used until mandelbrot can do the same his work will remain tangential at best irrelevant at worst
the story is fairly typical but the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable there are few surprises and the characters are forced down your throat with attempts at empathic situations which end up making you indifferent to their fates also this book was edited by an illiterate person there are numerous misspellings and the grammar in several parts is extremely sloppy
do dogs understand language do they have their own syntax and grammar stanley coren thinks so or maybe as with many of his other books he 's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people 's interest and sell more copies the words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant since i train dogs in manhattan i often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs when the door closes i 'll say what do we do on an elevator '' and they 'll all sit this often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like look ! they understand every word you say ! '' not really i trained the dogs to do this by first saying what do we do on an elevator sit '' once that pattern was established the dogs were able to make the leap from what do we do on an elevator '' to sit '' quite easily in fact i could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words gobbledygook ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all so it is n't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to it 's my intent my body language my tone of voice all carrying emotional information and a previously established pattern of behavior stanley coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf yet still obeys him why because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior not because the dog understands '' his words coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the understand sign language but looked at objectively it 's far more likely that the dog 's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior not a linguistic or cognitive process coren would still disagree he claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together which he takes to mean that there 's a kind of syntax or grammar at work i 'm sorry stan but real language does n't operate on such a simplistic level and while it may seem brave and controversial of coren who has a degree in psychology not linguisics or animal behavior to disagree with noam chomsky about the nature of language at this stage in the development of linguistic science that 's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with sir isaac newton about gravity look it 's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips barks growls etc are sometimes used together and others are n't which is n't always true by the way it depends on the dog is that each vocalization comes from an emotional not a cognitive state in other words certain emotions like fear and aggression may be felt by the animal simultaneously while others calmness and fear ca n't be it 's not grammar or syntax it 's emotion pure and simple even if coren had n't thought this through from an emotional point of view if he 'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he 'd know that a dog 's brain has no broca 's area which makes linguistic ability totally impossible but as with other books he 's written his syndrome was notorious for being based on false data coren does n't seem to care much about the truth still i have to admit that it 's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we 're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues or to others through conversations letters etc as a result we 're almost forced by the way our brains work to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog 's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists i trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever i ask him a certain question and i have to admit i like the way it feels when i say to him do you love me '' and he wags his tail comes over puts his paws on my chest and licks my nose does he understand the meaning of that sentence when i say it to him of course not but i know he understands the emotion it 's a shame that coren does n't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog a relationship that should be based on real and quite often wonderful emotions not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language if i could i 'd give this book no stars at all
the story is set up very well but goes nowhere the world present day england from inside the mind of autistic or some similar syndrome boy loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book lists footnotes sketches diagrams puzzles maps doodles graphs and even an appendix after 15 pages inside christopher 's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it i personally do n't think one needs 226 pages to get this across after the first one third of the book the story became repetitive tedious and boring
there 's no music as it were in what byatt does i have read three of her novels now and i 'm i think in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph a single sentence ! of james joyce i am an english prof hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick she drops so many you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away dreadful dreck you need something englishy to read investigate william boyd or julian barnes byatt is like a parody of good writing only salman rushdie 's fiction is more onanistic though his criticism 's pretty cool byatt is the literary equivalent of stevie nicks ! icky ! ! !
i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list
inspired by his uncle eddie who worked at an amusement park albom writes a tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience the concept is old a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths there are concepts to be learned from the five people the story is delightful and cavalier trish new author of the thrill of hope and south state street journal
the book is manipulative and unrealistic i felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend definitely one of the shallowest books i have ever read i bought the book as it was rated as a best seller '' and i was stuck in an airport for hours on end the entire plot is hideous as the burned best friend '' makes up reasons why it 's accept able to betray her best friend if i was not completely bored i would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages
i 've never written a review before but i feel compelled to this time it was just that bad i did n't have to finish it i kept waiting for it to get better when it did not i resigned myself to finishing it it was n't that hard being a lightweight beach novel it was a rainy saturday so i figured why not it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry i almost feel dumber for having read this is this really what women relate to if so that is so sad i found every character in this book just sad mind you i do n't find the characters or the tale unbelievable the tone that i should somehow empathize and root for true love c'mon ! even for a book that is n't supposed to be intellectually challenging it was nothing but a letdown f
i ca n't believe how many people rave about this book i just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow superficial books i have read in a very long time new york women all acting like spoiled little girls the whole story reminds me of the barbie phenomenon it they were to make a movie out of this book they should use all the barbie characters and let 's nor forget about ken ! such a waste of time
i read constantly and mostly light murder nothing gory etc gone was very boring and i believe so is because there are just too many was difficult to keep them all did n't seem to be much of a plot until practically the have read mr kellerman 's books before and found them a lot more enteraining than this one also he uses words i never heard before to describe something rather than stopping to look it up i would have to guess otherwise i 'd lose what little plot there was at the time also i get offended when the dirty 4 letter words are it was only by one neither needed to be in the story line
i read all jonathan kellerman books but this one put me to sleep i was disappointed i also think he should resolve this love interest and get robin back allison needs to go his books were better with robin these issues get boring after awhile
if you 're going to read one of the great classics of you n't pick up this edition it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel pick up the elegant naval institute press edition in a modern complete updated translation with commentary by the leading american verne expert today walter james miller that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition no illustrations are to be found in the b n mercier reprint less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by margot president najvs
do n't buy this book i 'll summarize it for you do n't just send out resumes go and talk to people at the organization you want to work for happiness is more important than money this book gets really preachy religious and cheezy in the second half it has no place in a career book and is in very bad taste some quotes from the book your first mission here on earth is to seek to stand hour by hour in the conscious presence of god the one from whom your mission is derived '' your second mission here on earth is to do what you can moment by moment day by day step by step to make this world a better place following the leading and guidance of god 's spirit within you and around you '' save your money just watch televangelists on tv if you want your life controlled by god
i had to buy this book for class and i tried to give it a shot and read it but it was really annoying a lot of what we needed to find a job was discussed in my portfolio class and was common sense the book did go over things to do and if you could get past all the personal mumbo jumbo blah blah that the author felt he had to assault you with it might be okay i just could n't get past all the preaching he kept doing it was extremely annoying
if you like hard science fiction i would recommend trying permutation city and diaspora by greg egan instead another book more similar to eon but far more readable is rendezvous with rama '' by arthur clarke not the sequels greg bear was n't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes in fact sometimes i have found very hard to understand his descriptions as others reviewers say not because of their technicallity but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted also part of the plot seems outdated be aware that this book was published in 1985 ussr cold war i have n't been able to read past a third of the book so this review may be a bit biased
riiiiing ! ! ! ! ! not only boring but poorly organized executed and written and did i mention boring after struggling through a few chapters i tried skimming ahead just to see what was going to happen unfortunately i could n't even do that because not much actually happens in the first 150 pages and that which does is so convoluted and unclear and written in such awful prose that it is hard to follow additionally although the world is about to come to an end in the story maybe i did not really care about the characters who are more wooden than billy baldwin 's acting can i be any more clear this book is terrible as far as the writing goes i 'll give you a few choice gems to whet your appetite in case you still want to give this mess a shot '' some of the outfits attracted her others were positively puritanical in a slinky sort of way '' hmmm those slinky puritanical outfits ca n't you just imagine them ! men 's clothing was no less flamboyant or somber '' looks like men 's clothing is also flamboyantly somber wish versace could take a hint from those futuristic flamboyantly somber humans ! many of the spellings had been simplified made more complex '' gosh ! both simplified and more complex how paradoxical ! guess we 've covered all the bases there ! so if you 'd like to read a spectacularly bad though paradoxically science fiction disaster with unexpectedly trite though inconceivably wooden prose about astoundingly boring though unexpectedly laconic characters i would highly recommend this disturbingly terrible though hopelessly awful book
this novel is far to long and tedious the twists were interesting but they were so submerged in a mass of words and unnecessary subplots that it was difficult to maintain interest it 's really a pity that the author did n't cut it down to a more readable size and focus on the main themes if it had been a bit more crisp '' and focused it probably would be one of the best science fiction stories of recent years
i would have i have never read danielle steel and once i went to pick up a book of hers and saw that it was priced above the normal amount for a paperback i put it down assuming she must be really good but as i had n't read anything by her i was n't willing to pay extra to do so well i got safe harbor from my local library on audiobook and figured i 'd give her a try as i listened to this novel i got very tired of the amateur lack of descriptiveness and of the redundancy i noticed that a few things were said over and over again throughout the novel like the fact that she had so much to do before the tragedy and now afterward she had too much free time and even though things were hard before she 'd rather have the business '' of a mentally ill son and a husband that did n't care about her as if the readers would n't remember or as if we did n't get her point the first 3 times many things were repeated like that and i felt like i was listening to a fifth grade creative writing assignment where the student had to meet a word requirement and did n't have enough content ophelie is weak simple and boring as is matt they have no personality the version i am listening to is the unabridged verson so i ca n't possibly be just missing something i understand that this is supposedly a novel of triumph and the will to survive but she did n't even care for her child and it had been a year perhaps these things do happen in real life but i 'd much rather read about women with some semblance of a spine it should have been one or the other ophelie 's husband should have been worth mourning so thoroughly i assumed this must have been one of her very first novels for it to be so blah but i checked the publication date and i 'm in shock perhaps danielle steel feels she is above having to deliver a quality novel with her fame i ca n't begin to understand how such a reknown author could release something so terrible
danielle steel has done it once again written a book that must have taken her all of one day i was really disappointed after summer in tropez but thought after a break from her books i 'd try again sorry i wasted my time this book is so repetitive same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph the story line seems to drag on forever if steel 's goal is to dumb '' her books down for the masses then she has succeeded this book is written at about an 's level do n't waste your time
reading this book was like reading a soap opera script nothing happened the same events were rehashed over and over and everything is revealed through a secret window the reader has into the thoughts of the characters the story was weak the characters far worse and the premise completely ridiculous why would any woman depressed or otherwise allow their daughter to continue a strange friendship with a strange older man she met on the beach implausible especially for someone who has lost all her loved ones to even take the chance with the daughter being lost insane danielle steel is a terrible writer that is if she even writes these books anymore poor writing poor editing what a waste of my time
i was raised in virginia and never understood the details of the battle of yorktown now i see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together immediately after finishing this book i returned to yorktown with an entirely different understanding i could relive the battle as if i had been there during the war it was fascinating ! i never learned this from history books male age 60
yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author does n't know how to write my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author 's alternative grammatical rules comma splices and sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading the following example is but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes '' he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand '' one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several sentences in a row like this the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft i do n't understand how authors get away with publishing such work and i do n't understand why readers put up with it another problem is the lack of convincing characterization everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home i think you get the picture few characters stand out on their own even lafayette is just another young officer the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book and shaara 's attempts at making his characters witty never work the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull beyond that i 'm doubtful about the author 's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter it 's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin 's mind but the rest of the time it does n't work well i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus either i 'm a lazy reader and i 'm not or the device is n't working well in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america in effect this novel is really about washington 's military camp and howe 's dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced some aspects of the story are interesting i enjoy reading about washington 's maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when but i wish now that i 'd just bought a decent beginner 's history on the war most of the book as literary fiction left me cold
this is one of the best books i have ever read on the revolutionary war even though it is technically classified as a novel it is accurately presented history shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book and presented the historical events accurately as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable the main participants in the revolutionary war were presented not as gods but as truly great and courageous men and women he also presented the details of battles troop movements condition of troops and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events i have a better understanding of the revolutionary war years than i have ever had and would highly recommend this book to every american who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country
the glorious cause '' is the sequel to rise to rebellion '' and since the first novel was so good i eagerly dove into this one but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization on a scale of 1 to 10 i give it a 4 as compared to the 8 i would give rise to rebellion '' the events recounted in rise to rebellion '' involving the lead up to the revolutionary war seemed so much more detailed and interesting with a vast array of characters that were so colorful john adams paul revere samuel adams ben franklin and others the glorious cause '' was not without its merits but it seemed so much drier and less appealing with a more narrow focus it was far too long in some parts to the point my attention wandered and getting through it was a chore in some sections unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages i listened to this book on audio tape during my commute and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene one element i felt truly slighted by was the coverage of benedict arnold and his defection to the british cause i assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material a mark of a good book is how i feel when i have finished reading it if i am disappointed i have reached the end of the story then i know it was time well spent getting to the end of the glorious cause '' felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project it was uncomfortable work and now that i 'm done i feel i can do something a bit more interesting because shaara did such a good job with rise to rebellion '' i do n't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility perhaps the subject matter did n't complement my taste as well i prefer interesting historial detail over tepid droning battle descriptions and i feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between rise to rebellion '' and the glorious cause
while i am aware that no career book is going to be a holy grail this one in particular seemed rather useless you are an infp you feel fulfilled by helping people so go find a job where you can do that '' was pretty much the extent of the advice it offered
john dunning 's booked to die '' was a new york times best seller and also won the prestigious nero wolfe award it is one in his series of denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective cliff janeway dunning who lives in denver colorado owned the old algonquin bookstore in denver for many years and booked to die '' duh ! is set in the world of rare and collectible books i really found it an interesting world to enter and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done but do i believe the designated villain a book dealer really would have killed not on your life and do i believe anyone would kill over some valuable books not on your life of course i realize that in the current world it must require great imagination to write a mystery that does n't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places still one of the first requirements of a mystery for me at least is at least temporary believability dunning writes well he does well by denver and as previously noted the book trade he 's a professional and the story keeps trucking along rented and all as i drove south into the coming snowstorm i thought about the truck and the mileage that bobby westfall had racked up i thought about greenwald and the ballards and the man snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield the road was getting slick '' still the book has a paint by numbers feel to me or rather it has no feeling to me supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard i 'd say the book did n't touch my emotions but that would n't be entirely true it left me with a bad feeling consider the first love interest deserts janeway without a word when he leaves the police force a woman who 's met up with the book 's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy suspicion is cast on the book 's later love interest a ploy that 's been used untold times by writers better than dunning and a old female character introduced only to be killed shortly is made a glaswegian scot no less and stuck with the given name of elspeth pride known as '' pinky '' by her friends for heaven 's sake if you 're giving a character only 30 pages to live at least give her a humane name my yiddische grandmother whom i loved used to say of someone she disliked '' he should live and be well '' after that came an unpoken sentence but not in my vicinity '' dunning should write and be well but not in my vicinity
i generally like elmore leonard this is the twelfth book of his i 've read ranging from his detroit crime capers to his chili palmer stuff to some of his westerns other than the terrible be cool '' this is probably my least favorite of his books so far set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 the story follows carlos carl '' webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot marshall the story takes place in the dusty midwest mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city as carl faces off with various desperados seeking to make a name for themselves carl is a somewhat vain cocky lawman with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man a no account young man who has everything he needs but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl 's path mixed into this are kinds of period details from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to true detective '' writers to striking miners to mentions of various bank robbers pretty boy floyd john dillinger and bonnie and clyde barrow despite all this background detail the story itself failed to engage me there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard 's best work there 's a good guy a bad guy and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic in fact about halfway through the book i realized that the real story '' was n't going to kick in i was in it ! and unlike many leonard books the supporting cast of characters is n't particularly memorable even leonard 's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech ultimately one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period and perhaps did n't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story that said the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story given the time and place all in all unless you 're really really into the whole gangster thing not worth the time
my student is all the title implies i wish i wish i wish the recipes lived up to the other reviews this assumes you have more of a stocked kitchen to work with and will be interested in starting from scratch there are actually words like homemade mild tomato salsa '' and toasted pine nuts '' there 's alot of explanation more words than recipes i think this is very readable very cute and looks like pretty good food but not for the hungry harried college student in a dorm who is n't going to roast peppers or go get fennel celeriac or even fresh broccoli
i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did
as a volunteer at an animal shelter this was the book to read for our book club i was sorely disappointed although i know foster 's heart is in the right place the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he did n't help which was quite disturbing additionally i found his writing skills poor his lack of explanation as to why for example his dog was vomiting blood left you hanging the book just ends no real ending to the story as i said i was very disppointed
when historians write about the day that ww iii began they could do worse than pick july 3 1979 the day that carter signed his executive order to start funding the mujahadeen in afghanistan at brzezinski 's urging if there was a real beginning of the modern clash of civilizations it began on brzezinski and carter 's watch while the islamic brotherhood had been building since the 1920 's it was only when these fanatics saw a weak usa that they began to expand their hatred into the west once we started funding the islamic fanatics and once we ran from them as we did when the mullahs ordered the imprisonment of american diplomats in iran for 444 days until carter and zb left office we were in for serious problems for generations to come but of course zb ignores all this and dismissed the impact of his decisions in his infamous interview with le nouvel observateur in 1998 as just causing a few stirred up muslims '' the taliban and predecessor organizations to al qaeda of course none of this important stuff is in this book there has probably never been a worse foreign policy team than zb and carter and now zb is baaaack to give us some more advice thankfully this book is short but it is full of the same kind of silly assumptions that led him and carter to draw the soviets into afghanistan to create the soviet vietnam '' we are somehow supposed to establish diplomatic counterpoints to what is really a great religious based upheaval one that he created zb 's assumptions that the french are going to join the russians and the us to counteract the forces of evil unleashed upon the world when zb and carter opened this pandora 's box are just plain ridiculous france has never looked at any alliance except through its commercial interests with a short exception when it was flat on its back during ww ii russia is not a new player on the scene and zb 's assumptions that somehow they will align their interests to the us and the west just to make the islamists feel better and stop the attacks is beyond idiotic if you want to read a book that describes a situation poorly and then comes up with even worse prescriptions for fixing the wrong things then this book is for you i picked this up thinking that he might have learned some lessons from his mistakes but i was wrong how this guy can even show his face let alone give us some more bad advice is beyond me
the accidental banker is a good book for those who buy every book in the genre for anyone more discerning than that it is a 'must leave ' the premise of the book is a personal memoir but the author is apparently too keen to maintain his relationships to engage in any personal stories really so it turns into a partial memoir the rest readable from old newspaper articles he misses talking about the scandals in the closet of goldman sachs or morgan stanley he was there when john thornton ran europe and does not comment on the power struggle that caused jon corzine to leave for john thornton to then leave for rob kaplan to leave and so on and so forth and how the investment banking side got eclipsed from the management of goldman what about the morgan stanley power struggle about which he could have offered some information the book itself is dilusional because it begins with the premise that jonathan knee a vp hired at the salary and bonus of was knowledgeable of john thornton 's inner circle or capable of knowing about it in the period discussed john thornton had alone taken a baseball bat to the new york office and won and had it not been the unusual talent of lloyd blankfein and his fixed income commodities crowd be running goldman sachs today there could have been no confusion that jonathan knee was his chief of staff in new york as he appears to think initially so the disappointment reflected his own overly bloated ego thirdly the book misses out the fact that his group heads peter kiernan and others were replaced by frank connor then still a vp so if knee 's boss was a vp in new york he was unlikely to be the powerplayer he claims to be fourthly he gingerly offers information about david lawrence an agent now an md but the scandal surrounding what lawrence does is well known certainly on the street so the author could have said more without hurting anyone fifthly his tenure at morgan stanley appears to have gone badly because the author seeks to be nice to everyone but attack his employers based on public knowledge the book thus fails to achieve any goal it does not offer the truth it does not offer scandal and it certainly does not analyze the business it reads like a 150 page resume
the left behind series is the best reading i have ever read i admit my reading is not all that much but when i read the very first book i was hooked i read all twelve books in about six weeks they lead me to understand the bible better thank you tim and jerry for such great books corrine robinson
to cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel as such it is n't even a decent trashy novel instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario an idea with virtually no scriptural support little in the characters ' actions thought processes or dialog rings true one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student god ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear who is the equivalent of lewis or catherine marshall and why are n't they getting more attention these were writers who actually made you think lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving in such a world might ask one wonders if they have ever met a at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter these days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured if is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind
ok i do n't mean to be rude but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated it is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing here 's my take i 'd enjoy a good end of times '' story this just is n't it the left behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the american public and this series proves it christians should demand better writing from their revered authors go read some lewis or something please
even the avid trekie '' reader of the star trek science fiction novels movies and television series must suspend disbelief when he finds captain kirk saying beam me up scotty '' but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the rapture '' though the characters and their roles are fictitious the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional conversions in the 2006 issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform billy graham 's biography by strober notes that they criticized graham 's new evangelism '' for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the tribulation force '' or as exemplified by jerry falwell 's moral majority they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the of the united nations the statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially while evangelicals and liberals southern baptists lutherans presbyterians methodists and catholics are continuing their per capita declines such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism 's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the left behind '' in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind and in not just a few respects they may be wise to do so thomas hickey

it has tons of information both fresh and processed foods but i found it difficult to look at the pages the cheap greyish mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading but when you 're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do after looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore i finally found one compact book with medium stock bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just 2 more the ultimate calorie carb fat gram counter by lea ann holzmeister i recommend that one over the netzer book
this book is not very helpful and confusing to use a lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels if you buy those brands
while this book contains a ton of data do n't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade if you look up french toast for example it only gives information on name brand items much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products i suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping or use it before eating out it would be helpful but if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items you are out of luck with this book
despite the author 's statement there is nothing revolutionary about this book in fact many suggestions in it are falling by the wayside paper training corrective jerk '' as we learn more positive fun ways to work with our dogs although it contains great suggestions for selecting a dog other books have better advice for example a simple guide to puppies '' for true enlightenment on dog communication read patricia mcconnell 's delightful the other end of the leash '' leave this one with its aggressive approach to training on the shelf
i so agree with clockwork bluejay 's review i had such high hopes being an o 's fan and a brooks robinson admirer all of my life i moaned and groaned throughout this book so much my husband suggested i send it back from baltimore mentioned several times as maryland 's capital '' to the poor los angeles radio listeners having to make do '' with chuck thompson instead of the author 's preferred vin scully i forced myself to keep reading only because i knew of the happy ending that lay ahead it seems that the orioles only won the series due to the litany of injuries to the dodger pitchers 2 of the 6 chapters are about poor sandy koufax and his problems or the fact that the dodgers were tired from their long season do n't all teams play 162 games while i appreciated the author 's crediting others for much of his information the footnotes were really distracting the book jacket lists the author 's home as new jersey but i would swear he is a true blue dodger fan from the slant of this book save yourself the time and money go to the library if you feel need to read it but do n't say you were n't warned
adelman persists in referring to baltimore as the capital of maryland not once but many times throughout the book this is annoyingly inaccurate have you ever heard of annapolis mr adelman but makes one wonder what other factual inaccuracies lurk in the book did this book actually have an editor do you get the feeling that editors these days merely hit grammar check and spell check and call it a day
i had rated this book a two '' in relation to other koontz books i have read the book is entertaining enough but is not very unique in relation to other books that koontz has written koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one i believe koontz tries to express certain generalties some of which have moral and religious undertones in the end good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature destroys itself love is worth fighting and dieing for love is stronger than evil what does not kill you makes you stronger evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries the key to happiness is love not material gain evil lurks where you least expect it
most of the issues that the author describes are the same as for any biological child for example the parents are trying to live through the child and put their own goals onto who does n't know biological families like this the child is a perfectionist and tries to please everyone becoming unhealthily obsessed with being good '' again we all know children like this whether adopted or not the high schools are full of them the author takes her experience adoption in the and assumes that things are the same today very few adoptive parents today would lie to their children pretending that they had given birth to them this is 2006 ! this book might be good for people in middle age who were adopted as infants assuming that they are still interested in deconstructing their childhoods
as the father of 3 open adoption teens and a adoption about to be finalized i find this book could possibly be discouraging to new adoptive families perhaps some of the issues the author deals with apply more to younger children but none of my sons after reading through this book with me have much good to say about it the part about birthdays in particular do not seem to ring true with the older children and it appears that the author still has serious issues of her own at the adult stage
as a mother of four adopted children i found this book to be very disturbing it came across as one woman 's way of venting her anger and frustration of being adopted she felt she was deceived and had never forgiven her parents both adoptive and natural she says she was never really told she was adopted she just found out i know many adults that were adopted as children and not one of them has ever expressed any feelings of having a primal wound '' like i said above the author seemed very angry she has her opinion that her adopted status '' was the cause of all her probems i tend to disagree look inside woman ! not all problems are someone else 's fault
i am a 38 year old adoptee and adoptive parent i was adopted as an infant as was my own adopted daughter as others have pointed out this book is clearly both overly negative and overly dramatic i would like to add that following the advice of the author could even be very harmful to your adopted child in particular i was taken aback by the author 's suggestion that you should essentially tell your child that he or she must have unresolved grief issues and help him or her uncover them that is just plain wrong please understand that it is entirely likely that your child especially if he or she was adpoted as an infant will never have any significant feelings of loss or grief do not create those feelings out of some misguided effort to help your child uncover '' supposedly suppressed feelings in my own experience i have always known that i was adopted and that i have been loved by my parents i simply have no negative feelings regarding my own adoption none however if my parents had read this book when i was a child and decided that they needed to tell me that i must have those feelings and we had to find them and focus on them i undoubtedly would have needed years and years of therapy the advice in this book might have some helpful relevance to those who are adopted as older childen however for those adopted a infants what you should do is tell them early and often that they are adopted and loved let them know that you are always available to talk with them about any feelings or questions they might have if they have questions answer them matter of factly do not burden them with negative feelings that they probably do not have and will never develop
i am a 39 year old adoptee what rubbish ! your parents are the people that raise you period my parents raised me to believe that my adoption was a ' and i was always fine with that adoption is a truly wonderful thing and i wish it were done more instead of abortion i have never felt different from other kids who were not adopted i just got my parents in a different way if you are a 'progressive ' parent that thinks you need to dwell on 'issues ' and 'grieve ' you will certainly create those issues get a life people worry about something meaningful please i 've met my birth parents found them when i was about 30. nice people but complete strangers not my parents not much in common grateful they put me up for adoption so i could have a good life that they would 've been unable to give me much more harm is being done today to children that their teenage and single moms keep them out of selfishness and ruin the kids ' life because they are n't ready to be a parent if they really cared about their child they would give them up for adoption it takes courage selflessness and maturity to make the decision to give a child up for adoption
i would not recomended this book to anyone who is thinking of adoption i think the women who wrote the book has a lot of issues in her life that she needs to work out i do believe that a child that is adopted has grief but to say you should tell that child everyday that you are sorry that their birth parents could not take care of them is crazy i think it would be better for the child if you helped them to feel safe secured and loved
does anyone even care that the author '' john miller formerly of abc 's and then the head of counterterrorism for the lapd is currently the assistant director of public affairs for the fbi in the bush regime i mean administration this book is propaganda period
this book is awful and out of date i read a friend 's copy and hated it she attributes agression to schizophrenia says that psychology has absolutely no place in training animals and thinks that a fearful dog can be cured by walking it around for an hour and giving it steady pops on the choke chain she also feels that no dog should be allowed to lick people on the face and that cryptorchidism where one of the testicles does not descend causes behavioral problems right i think perhaps this book was considered alright in the 70 's now we that you can not fix all of a dog 's problems simply by popping it with a choke chain i beleive that training collars to have a place in working with some dogs but there is no wonder cure for everything and many dogs simply do not need them they can cause tracheal damage when used improperly and many many people use them wrongly even when being instructed and what 's more they can damage a dog emotionally making it more fearful than when it started she also claims that a timid dog can be made into a happy confident dog simply by improving its tail carriage making it run with steady pops on the choke chain while adopting a confident or happy body position can with a creature 's emotional state like when you feel happier because you 're smiling it certainly will not a behavioral problem her statement is akin to saying that a depressed person can completely solve their clinical depression simply by smiling for 20 minutes every day i agree with her on using confinement crate training with puppies but there are far better and more up to date resources
i have discovered that byock 's translation is regrettably bland it appears that he translates which gives the english prose a clumsy summarizing '' kind of a feel the translation lacks a beautiful flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal subjective experience said again he should have taken personal ownership '' of the story and written it in modern english according to his own inner feeling richly imagining the events and meaning and then writing a faithful but new story instead he rather logically translates with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative i believe that portraying one 's own inner experience of a story is more valid '' than a rendering of it although the text is clear to a fault i was disappointed with it i recommend a different translation
while i found the book to be barrie 's style for the most part i thought it lacked his spirit the original peter pan was full of fun adventure laughter it was uplifting and made me wish i was a child again so i could join peter and the others this story could have done so much more with the characters i found the story somewhat depressing there was no fun i missed the characters of the first story where was smee how can there be a peter pan without smee and the crocodile this story was dark peter was angry depressed greedy and full of negativity why would i want my child to read this he almost was n't the main character ravello was a sequel to a famous story such as peter pan should continue with the positivity and joy of the first and this book certainly did n't do that
this story is very dark full of menace and dark thoughts not great for kids ok for adults if that 's what you like a hard story not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments
while this book may be helpful to children who are seen as special '' or crippled '' i would never recommend it because of the title which is bad as the lamb '' would be get it i 'm an advocate for people with disabilities the preferred term and can assure you that a book called crippled '' and terms like special '' will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause children to be perceived even more as special '' instead of different but equal
i bought this book because a reviewer said it would teach people with asperger 's syndrome how to make and manintain eye contact it does n't it just says you should make and maintain eye contact it does n't teach you how this book only tells you what society expects of you so if you already know what society expects of you but just can not figure out how to do it smoothly do n't buy this book if you already know stuff like pull up your pants before coming out of the bathroom '' do n't buy this book
peter lynch 's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success i used to believe things i read in books because a good publisher like simon and schuster would publish it i counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling i also avoided reading tealeaves '' like drawing trendlines on what i was actually concerned about the price of the stock ! now i make a living reading tealeaves '' and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up my suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like john murphys technical analysis of the financial markets start there then go on to learn more advanced ta i also like investor 's business it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand ibd i also swingtrade hold stocks for days sometimes longer
not all that useful really message is buy mutual funds ! '' in general since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market just buy index funds would be the best advice most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the ceo to go over the financials and confirm your valuation oh thanks peter what great advice gates your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares ''
i could sum up this book very quickly 1 trust in god for everything 2 read the bible 3 attend church 4 ask your husband church other christians for help the book is full of fluffy ideas like we need to know ourselves the way god knows us '' find a christian counselor '' and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help the book primarily revolves around the bible and its interpretation of parenting why not cut out the and just read this wonderful book '' it 's not like the bible is a work in progress this book is more about proselytizing and keeping evangelicals reading inspired '' books rather than competing viewpoints and with america being one of the most pure christian nations in the world us is more christian than india is hindu and israel is jewish anything published by zondervan should be looked at skeptically i also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the christian community they can assist and help but can not be considered primary parents but given this books lack of true substance i doubt it would have made any difference
i was so excited when i bought this book dispair set in once i disovered the focus was on stay at home moms of very young children i could n't get past all of the examples of the trails and tribulatiions of new moms '' to focus on the balancing act of working moms
i have enjoyed several books by anna quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering i settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before i finally gave up i found the writing trite and boring i did n't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something i 'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow 's ear rise and shine not this time
this book was selected by my book club i had never read anna quindlen before rise and shine was a disappointment to me i kept hoping that meghan would somehow be redeemed but that did not happen she is really not very likeable i thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning leo 's tradgedy meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again the book left me with an empty feeling it was not a satisfying read
anna qiuindlen wrote a very jeuvenile novel this time her past books were worthy of praise but this is a silly story i was very disappointed and need to remind myself not to buy a book from an author that i have previously enjoyed until i read reviews
sorry but i could not even finish it i was bored out of my mind i just did not feel the characters had any depth if i put down a book it is rare that i will pick it up again
most of the information was in his other books i was looking for recipes not a rehash of his other factual writing the few receipes included were not very exciting
would you stand in line at an applebee 's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good better a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes of course not ! why then would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two james patterson books or a patterson and a connelly or two thomas harris books my apologies greg iles but for a simple formulaic serial killer book blood memory was just way too long the book has two one involves a serial killer who murders older men the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead the serial killer plot is actually the more interesting but at least of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the secret '' is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book all in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if iles his editor chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text iles just loves to have two characters sit and talk for 40 or even 50 pages but since most of his dialogue is what i call soap opera '' speak meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths these chapters dragged on and on and on iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream taking showers and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely come on greg why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it 's some strange exotic treat that no one 's ever heard of before just as some people love to hear themselves talk i think iles loves to see himself write and although some of his books have been quite good blood memory misses the mark by a long shot
this book began to contradict on matter of king of kings ismail in one chapter author wrote that king ismail was a great king and was the best thing happened to iran the following chapter the author illustarted king ismail as a burtail king of iran
this book has several mentions of the baha'i faith in it referring to the faith as an offshoot of islam '' and in one part quoting someone as making the baha'is out to look like violent animals i will never read anything by this author again she may be aware of iran 's history and politics but is very miseducated in the area of the baha'i faith not bahaism as she writes it the baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes
this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history mossdaegh did not assume dicatatorial powers and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah the crimes of savak the shah 's secret police arent well documented either dont waste your i recommend the last great revolution by robin wright or persian mirrors by elaine sciolin
it is difficult for me to avoid the clich of saying i feel ripped off by fraud so i 'll just get writing that out of the way right off the bat looking over the other reviews here i do n't understand how more readers do n't feel the same way writer david rakoff 's collection of essays leaves a taste of disappointment in my mouth that wo n't go away made worse by the fact that he makes it clear he could do so much better there 's no doubt that he 's a talented writer with a great feel for words albeit unusually large ones and a keen eye for the absurd he 's lived a very interesting life full of improbable events and unforgettable personalities i 'd probably even consider reading another of his books but i honestly hope to never crack open fraud again i think rakoff seriously overestimated how interested the world is in his internal anguish his bitter naval gazing and the way he looks down his nose at the rest of us the book is needlessly complicated packed with obscure references and unnecessary words and because of the combination of those factors the book does n't ever really gel it 's as if rakoff is trying to appear cleverly and profoundly but with a superiority complex i do n't think it can be done yet rakoff tries time and time again it 's tempting to think that fraud 's weaknesses could have been fixed by the right editor but the more i think about it the less convinced i am that such a person exists i now think rakoff would be better off starting over and this time repeating to himself another clich as he starts each page keep it simple stupid
like other reviewers i bought this book based on amazon 's 'if you like david sedaris ' wrong ! rakoff depressed and bored me i read most books in 2 to 3 days but it took me two weeks to get through fraud sedaris made me laugh out loud i never even cracked a smile with this guy some of the stories could be really interesting but he takes the fun out of a dry sense of humor
i purchased this book because as a david sedaris fan it was recommended to me by amazon if you like this book you 'll like '' after reading a few pages i realized that the only thing david sedaris and rakoff have in common is their first name sedaris engages his readers and accompanies them on the journey he puts forth in print rakoff however throws his words at the reader and runs away abandoning the reader in a quagmire of words and phrases i 'm an educated person but rakoff uses words that i 've never heard before you need to read this book with an accompanying dictionary there is at least one word per page that you 'll have to lookup even if you 're a college professor i tried to finish this book but only made it about way through it was too much work and i like to read for pleasure
i picked up white noise '' with eager anticipation i 've heard don delillo 's praises sang loudly from many prestigious sources the new york times among them so i was anxious to give him a try myself i must say that i am disappointed white noise '' has done what no other book has achieved in a long time it thoroughly aggravated me it reads like a philosophical treatise disguised as a novel where the author clearly did n't care enough about the aspects to flesh them out at all there 's a premise about a billowing black cloud or airborne toxic event '' as delillo grandly calls it that leads nowhere except to give the people who populate delillo 's novel something to muse on for the rest of the book the characters are uniformly annoying and while they all have characteristics that make them initially intriguing delillo manages to squash any interest you may have had in them by refusing to give any dimension to them the narrator jack gladney has earned renown as a professor of hitler studies his fourth wife babette teaches classes on posture and eating techniques son heinrich is a moody junior philosopher who takes everything literally and figuratively at the same time colleague murray hangs out in the grocery store to watch people eagerly consume products and more it sounds interesting hey it sounds like a kurt vonnegut novel and come to think of it i 'd rather read his spin on these characters any day but delillo is n't really interested in them as people he only presents them as allegories there to spout philosophical dialogue back and forth said dialogue is occasionally interesting and sometimes but becomes too tiresome and heavy and all too often it feels that delillo is straining way too hard to make a point that was specious in the first place characters are constantly clamoring for definitions in conversations that come off just as irritating as bill clinton asking what your definition of is '' is all this talk and what is delillo ultimately saying another reviewer called this a stubborn perplexing '' book and i heartily agree as i said earlier there are moments where the fog clears and delillo makes a good point pages and come to mind but all too often it just feels like he 's arguing for argument 's sake philosophical novels with allegorical characters have been done much better in my opinion see the lord of the flies '' or animal farm '' for examples and with far less infuriating results
the winner and absolute truth made me continue reading baldacci last few books christmas train and split second were baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our was the last money i ever spend on a baldacci book i even threw out his good books shut up baldacci and write fiction books your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world
i liked it better than the hour game which was so slow i never finished it baldacci has unfortunately like other authors gotten a little preachy they disguise it as part of the story as if their readers do n't see it but there are whole sections that flash author 's message '' in neon lights first there are much subtler ways to send a message second i just do n't like being preached at no matter if i agree or disagree with the message i stopped reading tom clancy opposite view for just this reason
i found this book to be offensively the characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts the best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises i think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters
some good ideas on driving innovation but in hindsight some of the cited companies have n't passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance one of my favorite quotes from the book at enron failure even of the type that ends up on the front page of the wall street journal does n't necessarily sink a career '' yeah right ! this kind of thinking puts one in jail
this book is about a jewish girl named hannah green who flees from spain in fear of the spanish inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a jew she comes to england with her father and lives as a christian while following the jewish religion in secrecy through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy for both queen mary and elizabeth throughout the book hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother 's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for queen mary and what a wonderful woman she is it is well documented in history as well as this book about queen mary 's burning of hundreds of at the stakes a practice that earned her the name bloody mary the book is very sympathetic towards queen mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake only doing what she believed to be right in her heart '' the fact that hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a jew and continued to deeply love queen mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous i could not help but roll my eyes every time i read how much hannah loved and admired queen mary
butterfly stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity 's sake this was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience similar to some of vollman 's other work this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with vietnam and the khmer rouge regime in cambodia as background unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling
a totally worthless piece of garbage
he called for the to roar '' just before the tech bubble burst and the sputtered he predicted at the beginning of 2005 that the dow would hit by year end hmm maybe his theories are just wrong why would a careful investor want to risk his money in a bubble of a market anyway even dent acknowledges the bubble boom '' will end badly the coming crash will catch most investors by surprise it wo n't come on dent 's schedule anymore than the crash did he did n't see it coming his predictions of what will happen year by year into the future are ridiculous considering his totally off the mark predictions for 2005. no one can see the future but a lot of investment gurus are arrogant or dishonest enough to try to convince us they have special abilities to see what the rest of us ca n't dent even throws in some elliott waves '' a form of numerology that has proven to be irrelevant at best as a forecasting tool and has caused most people who swear by it to underperform the market wave theory guru bob prechter has been trying to short the market for over a decade convinced by his wave count '' that the dow will go to 400 obviously dent has a different wave count '' one that points to my advice is to not put everything in stocks and to have at least 15 of your investment assets in gold and commodities this has been the bubble boom '' so far in the roaring '' even though dent has not recommended commodities
dow jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring and then the we are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the when war energy crises international market expansions and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise the main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago we are now owing other countries trillions of dollars and the trade deficit will continue to soar the economy may sink as a result but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting that was already done in the stock market years ago should the economy finally collapse it will have to do with our structural economic problems most probably prefer a rather than a hard collapse it will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition it will be about our committment to paying down the debt ending our oil dependence and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be outsourced '' to other places as this review is being written the alleged greater bubble '' has yet to be materialized however stocks will not emerge into a greater bubble unless the american people can become optimistic about the economy again dent has been wrong in his past predictions so please do not take this book too seriously either
the most disappointing so far in the 'popular culture and philosophy ' series these essays have little to do with either lotr or philosophy in the traditional sense instead attempting to cover everything from environmentalism to narrative structure as a general format the authors state their intentions to mold tolkien 's world to their own pet ideas and quote profusely while saying little that convinces one of the essays even admits that the buddist parallels it 's spent the last few pages proposing are clearly superficial '' why waste the print then another oddity here is a collection of quotes by various noted philosophers that have nothing to do with either the themes in lotr or in many cases the topics the essays address extremely discouraging
if i were a junior college lit instructor who gave the assignment write a paper on the philosophical implications of the lord of the rings '' and received these papers i 'd give most of them solid b 's they 're diligently researched competently written and show that the authors have grasped the nature of the problems they discuss but the authors are n't college freshmen they 're professors themselves they should n't look like children next to the scholars in tolkien the medievalist '' tolkien 's legendarium '' or tolkien and his literary resonances '' but they do one expects them to do better than this and to integrate their two subjects with subtlety instead of undergraduate bland awkwardness one author who 'd not get a b is scott davison who completely messes up his summary of tom shippey 's subtle but clear perspective on the nature of evil in tolkien as expressed in his the road to '' and tolkien author of the century '' thus unfairly making shippey out to be an idiot
i have read all of sandra brown books i was disappointed in this one i have almost all of her books in my bookcase but when i finished this one i gave it away
i 've been a sandra brown fan for many years and still am however i 'm glad i borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback this was definitely not her best work try your library first
sandra brown is my favorite writer i always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception however i was very disappointed with ricochet normally her books have so many twists and turns that you ca n't figure out who did it '' until the very end which keeps you up all night wanting to read this book was different i kept thinking it would get better but it never did i highly recommend chill factor or white hot instead of ricochet
with each book she writes jodi picoult comes down a level in terms of quality rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well this novel is a pinball machine of ideas people and issues that never come together i kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word
i have n't read a picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but i saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey it was entertaining to the extent that i finished it unfortunately it was still formulaic and completely predictable elements that i liked rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs and alcohol are especially difficult the confusion and obfuscation that picoult writes whether that was her intention or just poor writing surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and trixie though a little over the top seemed like a typical teenager the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and trixie also seem plausible i liked the graphic novel the melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate daniel the hidden word bit hokey i liked learning about the native cultures in alaska i would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by picoult i liked the idiot 's guide to dante that was incorporated into the book things i did n't like picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus was n't able to fully develop it all though i liked the native alaskan bit it was too jumbled and it did n't really add to the plot like another reviewer i was n't left with the impression that daniel 's haunted past resurfaced i was expecting a lot more murder that 's too much to add to this already overburdened plot we lose threads here and there like daniel 's career and the wife 's affair he just disappears after his admission cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and jodi does n't explain or develop it i do n't know that it was at all believable could the myopic trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to alaska when she could barely see beyond her own and tried to commit suicide multiple times the cop the dna analyst the lawyers the parents the twist i 've seen them all before in jodi 's other books it 's part of her formula i wonder what would happen if jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot she could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics i feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself her readers and literature a disservice
i think this novel is best for younger readers i found it a little cheesy i stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention
i like most of jodi picoult 's books but this was the worse one i have ever read the story line was ridiculous and unbelievable the main character in the book trixie is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this they go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions the drawings in the book were distracting and annoying i would not recommend this book to anyone
she never has an appropriate ending can she go back to school and learn the abc 's '' of how to end a novel this was just lame you couldnt really get into the characters and i felt nothing for them becasue of this book i will not read her novels again
i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books but this one seemed too i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and detracted from it many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release
i have been reading jodi picoult 's books since i first came across the pact at the library and from there i glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as songs of the humpback whale and then her books keeping faith salem falls perfect match and plain truth unfortunately in recent years i have n't been able to get into some of her titles specifically vanishing acts and my sister 's keeper the latter title was just too sad for me to finish it was therefore with some trepidation that i picked up the cd of the tenth circle while at the library because i was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form i was concerned that i might be missing something although other readers said i would n't be missing much but at this point i must add that while the reader did a fine job and i was initially intrigued with the plot and characters this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me i wo n't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this rather offer instead my views just as i finished this title i just finished listening to the tenth circle and found it was such a grim book not that jodi picoult 's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said there ought to be a moratorium on grief '' unbelievable the imagination some writers have maybe that 's why they 're writers and i 'm not but there were some unanswered questions coincidence sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly and i might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book i enjoyed but i do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but i just found it overall very disappointing i do hope i 'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but i used to love this author 's books and wonder if i 'll continue to read her which makes me sad
do n't let the title of this book fool you sure it may include recipes with all of the four food groups but take caution they are not presented in the most wholesome and healthful ways for example whole grain breads piled with chocolate chips lentil chilis flavoured with dry onion soup mix desserts made with instant pudding mixes soups made with canned soup i still do n't understand that concept if you are going to make a homemade soup from scratch why spoil it with canned soup ! i could go on and on but the underlying theme of this book is somewhat healthy food mixed with highly processed convenience foods this may be good for some families but i am choosing not to feed her food to my children for families that are choosing not to feed meat to their children for various reasons my 19 month old twins do n't like the taste of meat and have chosen the vegetarian path on their own this book offers no alternatives to the traditional meat and potatoes '' type meal there is not one tofu recipe in this book at all plus she only includes a handful of inadequate bean and lentil recipes boy is she ever missing the big picture ! now is the time to develop good healthy eating habits with our children whether they are 2 or 12 we need to make every bite count nutritionally for our children especially since the incidence of childhood obesity is on the rise snacks are just as important for your children as meals and they should be taken seriously bridget swinney 's suggestions for snack food are crunch munch mix popcorn pretzels dressing mix or dirt cake instant pudding whipped topping cookie crumbs gummy worms who would feed this to their kids on a regular basis how about fresh fruit and vegetables or homemade muffins and loaves for snacks our families deserve the best and because of this we should be feeding our children as well as ourselves more natural wholesome foods do n't assume that because they are natural and wholesome that these foods do n't taste good for a much more appropriate cookbook that addresses good nutrition with a major emphasis on good wholesome natural foods try shelly null 's healthy cooking for kids building blocks for a lifetime of good nutrition '' although it is almost a completely vegan cookbook her approach and her recipes will build a strong foundation for a lifetime of good nutrition and health this book definately gets five stars as for bridget swinney 's book the only reason that she got one star was because zero stars was not an option for rating this horrible cookbook i am sending this book back to amazon tomorrow with no regrets
i just purchased this book and i was really excited when i received it however after 5 attempts of trying to install the i gave up and the worest thing is i tried to visit the website the book provided in order to get to contact with them ask for help i was not allowed to view the page cuz they blocked a lot of ip address and the cable company that i have is on their list if you want to get a useful for drug reference do n't get this book it will cause you a lot of headache troubles get drug handbook published by springhouse the software is good and i never had any problem with it
was not impressed narrow scoped personal reflections applications limited i also read the male companion book wild at heart and was also not impressed
sharp and insightful a very satisfying look behind the curtain of secrecy that prevails at the bush whitehouse
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and does n't let go mercy stands out from all the rest you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
if a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you does that mean it 's a good book or a bad book in the case of mercy i 'll have to go with the latter i found i could not get past my intense dislike of both cam and mia truly two of the most despicable selfish characters i 've ever read in any book i 've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities their sole intent were their own wants and needs regardless of who cam 's wife allie got hurt allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over i never got that impression she was the owner of her own business and she was determined to help cam 's cousin jamie she also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband it was her love and loyalty that cam felt totally comfortable in betraying at one point late in the book allie asks cam if he and mia had laughed at her he tells her no however in a way they did considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed i felt for allie she deserved far better then cam i really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of picoult 's books i understand her latest book the tenth circle is no different she is without a doubt an excellent writer but this one just was n't for me
this was the book i 've read by jodi picoult and the one i liked the least i was intrigued by the subject of the book as i have been with all of the subjects she has written about but this story did not measure up to my expectations at all this book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing and could you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time one of the main characters is cam macdonald who is the sheriff of wheelock mass cam 's cousin jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to cam citing that he has just murdered his wife later you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked jamie to kill her so naturally jamie has to go on trial well a majority of the book turns out to be about cam 's adultery which is annoying in and of itself it seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok ' since as you discover cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it 's expected of him plus the person he has the affair with he has known a day or so which is ridiculous interspersed throughout all of this almost seeming like an afterthought is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover i was very bored with this book but continued to read it thinking it was bound to pick up eventually it never did as it turned out i ended up skimming the last 80 pages if i were you i 'd pick another novel
i am with the other people who reviewed this item stating that it is kinda pointless to be releasing a boxed set for this series i know for a fact that they have been doing this since at least book 4 and each time the next book comes out they are just making the box bigger this is just a huge rip off for the people who buy boxed sets '' for the novelty of the box once the next book comes out they basically have to just set it on the shelf next to the boxed set personally i think that for the most part the idea of putting your books in a box like this is kinda stupid anyway i prefer to have mine individual on the shelves i am not opposed to the idea of releasing them in nice slipcases though anyway i 'll quit my rambling lets just end it at this if you are absolutely one of those peeps who need the box set wait until the last book comes out and buy it then the one star here is for the boxed set not the individual books which are all brilliant
i 've read all 6 of the books i think they 're great ! but why would you spend 100 on a 6 book box set when there are 7 books in the series better to hold off on buying the box set until is a complete set but maybe that 's just me 2 stars because the books are incredible
nothing innovative or exciting anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio
i enjoyed covey 's work and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books this is one of the most heavy handed preachy books that i have encoutered give me a break ! after vomiting i threw it out save your money and try these instead leadership challenge 21 irrefutable laws of leadership good to great first break all the rules
when i reviewed the street lawyer recently i mentioned that i 've never put down a grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props for that book certainly for this one nope i read four chapters 41 of its 391 pages and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot i hope he just had an off day or something and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable
this book is about a man named ray atlee whose father has just died leaving 3 million in unexplained cash someone else knows about the money the three major questions for the book to answer are 1 where did the money come from 2 who is the mystery person or people trying to get it 3 what will ray do with it i have reached page 261 in this book and none of these questions have been answered ray has moved the money around been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere 261 pages in all i know is where the money did n't come from this is a legal thriller that does not thrill the pacing is deadly dull and i keep waiting waiting waiting for something to happen and nothing does finally i threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when i realized how close to 300 pages i 'd gotten with nothing happening i do n't know why i even gave the book this much of a chance nothing bad has happened to him and even though three million is at stake none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it if they were really following him as much as it 's alluded to in the book they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash he spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car for god 's sake ! i may finish it one day but as of now i just do n't care about the money or the characters who are after it not grisham 's best by a long shot
as mentioned previously there is no cohesion in this book the author arranges her tale in chronological chapters but there is no order within any individual chapter for example she examines things that happened in 1945 before mentioning events that took place in 1939. this would be forgivable if there were any sense of drama to the proceedings but there is none just anecdote after anecdote strung together like birds on a wire i hope it 's this lackluster anemic presentation that made me dislike dorothy as the book ground on some attention is given to her politics but much more of the book is focused on her love affairs her dogs her husbands her inability to save money she was a flawed woman but the author presents her flaws without any attempt to get us to understand parker overall this book was about 100 pages too long written in a competent but bland style that presents facts instead of personality strangely the only time meade dropped her respectful tone was in talking about lillian hellman she writes about the actress with barely concealed contempt as if hellman had personally injured her maybe meade should have written hellman 's bio instead she 'd probably have brought more passion to the table
results makes a solid case for building blocks that a good business 101 textbook would tell you make up a company 's likelihood for success but results misses the mark on identifying or leveraging company personalities the term personality ' is misused instead of a company 'personality ' the authors appear to be more accurately describing the maturity or efficacy of a company which is a very different realm said another way the survey tool and the book do not describe a company 's personality they describe a company 's level of dysfunction results illustrates a preferred end of the efficacy spectrum labeled healthy in which companies are said to have mature capacities for what we know are best practices for decisions org charts metrics and performance infrastructure on the unhealthy end are companies that have not developed similar capacities results would then have us believe that all companies should aspire to become the same personality herein lies the misnomer of the term ' the spectrum of dysfunction offers a simplistic explanation of what makes a company 'work ' but it is only a company 's personality is three dimensional a company 's personality is also founded on its core values core beliefs signal behaviors its attitudes and its vision if you are looking to leverage success through understanding your company 's personality read companies are people too fekete 2003 instead this book and tool set offer a well rounded approach to understanding company personalities and provides a way for all company personalities to have their place and still be successful ! intuitively it makes more sense to assert that all company personalities are necessary to create a diverse and creative market for leaders within a company it is imperative to identify and identify with ! the unique and salient strengths of their company 's personality only armed with this information can a company distinguish itself from its competitors we can initiate change in business practices but we can not inherently change a company personality nor should we try ! the idea of changing the personality of a company would be like trying to beat gravity ! results does offer sound basic business lessons regarding infrastructure necessary for business success but it does not fulfill on the promise of understanding and leveraging a company 's personality to get there
half of these stories i have read before and the other half i did not like everything in this book is pointless first of all sedaris ' name in big letters on the cover why because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection the reason the book is published to benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about well i am giving two stars and not one just because i liked the color of the cover kind of greenish salad color
i failed to realize that this was a book edited '' by as opposed to written by '' david sedaris until his introduction incidentally the introduction was the only portion of the book that i actually enjoyed his analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song i do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes i do not think they were bad stories actually i would like to take that back if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad it was however impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the gre vocabulary words in one short story i will not stop buying the books that david sedaris authors i will just be more careful david sedaris is a brilliant he may not capture all or even any of the elements of a good '' short story i would not know an element of a good short story if i ran into one coming off the elevator i do know that david sedaris ' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism i can not wait for the next book he actually writes
this is a good primer for someone very new to the game i would suggest handicapping 101 by brad free as a better choice i expected a bit better from eng as he is certainly a respected and knowledgable handicapper he may have been limited by the publisher
there 's very little in this book you could n't learn from one of the free pdf downloads on the daily racing form website it 's an introduction to what happens in and around the track that does n't help you at all with learning how to handicap strictly lowest common denominator stuff nothing that will help you think for yourself at the track you 'd be better off picking up a copy of brad free 's brilliant handicapping 101 instead this one falls far below the usual dummies standards
while it is understandable that every histrical account treatise or even research based on available historical data tends to get subjective it is hardly an excuse when blatant personal biases come through in a text book written by a so called scholar murphey 's version of a history of asia '' is the text book assigned for my otherwise wonderful asian studies class let me quote some examples from the sixth edition para 6 plunder and slaughter in the name of god did not make a good impression for islam on most indians but the austere new religion with its offer of certanity and equality of all did apeal to some as wherever it spread to other countries '' so what is the author saying he is talking about mahmud of ghazni whose remote mountain ringed capital became a great center of islamic culture thanks in part to stolen indian riches '' so is he saying that islam brought equality and justice to india or is he saying that islam brought plunder and brutalty to the region or is it his own bias showing through it is also interesting to note that when finding a passage to quote from the quran as opposed to the ones he picks to quote from other scriptures he chooses the now fight in the name of god against those who fight against you but do not commit aggression '' is this all that islam represents to the learned professor that he wants to pass on to his audience did he care to mention the context in which those verses were said and written did he know that that the first thirteen years of islam muslims were forbidden to fight back even in the face of violent persecution the kind known only to the arabian desert of 1500 years ago lets move on when talking about the most important event of islam the hijrah pp 36 or the migration of the prophet from makkah to madinah murphey says when preaching against these evils attracted few supporters he mohammad moved to medina '' really was that the reason for the hijira in actuality the persecution of muslims had increased to the level where they were being systematically killed by arab pagans and muhammad himself was the target of assasination attempts it is in the light of those events that muslims belive he was ordered to migrate to medina by god murphey futher goes on to say that the the migration is used to mark the first year of the muslim era known as the year of the prophet '' please ! ! it is known as hijri '' or the year of the migration '' further references to islam are too blatantly biased to pass off as mere ignorance or not one of murpheys area of expertise '' as some would like to discount let me quote here for example women have an explicitly inferior status can be set aside at will by their husbands must cover their bodies my comment the favorite of those who can not tolerate seeing women in anything but bikinis of course and face outside their own domestic quarters to which they are largely confined and are subject to their fathers brothers and husbands in all things the koran also sanctions holy war jihad '' and it goes on which culture is murphey trying to describe here some backward desert tribe in a islamic state or that prescribed by islam itself i would definitely be interested in knowing the sources he has used to arrive at these statements by the way the word jihad '' does not translate to holy war '' in fact there is no word or phrase in the arabic language that translates to this remnant phrase from the crusades jihad '' merely means struggle '' the fact is that in a society that practiced female infanticide and left hundreds of women widowed and cast out from being respectable members of the society due to tribal wars that waged for years islam brought rights and respect to women it allowed the widowed women to be married respectably rather than be abused mistresses to already married men it allowed women to vote and to make important decisions in the community it dispelled the practice of depriving women of the right of posessing property and the limitation of their right of transaction it cancelled the practice of husbands despotism in the property of their wives in short among many other social and individual benefits islam guaranteed rights to to women fifteen hundred years ago that modern western civilizations had not been able to guarantee till a few decades ago i would give this book a zero star if the option existed how can i read the rest of the book without knowing that it is not tainted with the authors biases ignorance and prejudice not knowing if this so called account of asian history is accurate i would refrain from recommending it as a text book
part of the work involved in writing is editing through editing a writer editor if the writer does not do own can eliminate any word that is not essential to the text minimizing the amount of text required to express the author 's ideas i believe hemingway wrote about this and how he applied it to his work in the case of glickman 's book i became bored rather quickly given that she took too many pages to express the same ideas and concepts it 's not that the idea is a bad one but i do n't think that the book is the best it can be '' it is written in a manner i purchased the book based on the glowing reviews and on the comments by respected authors such as covey blanchard et al de bono 's comment seems to be focused on thinking not optimal thinking though while i 'm glad the book is appreciated by many people famous or not it is certainly not for me i gave it away and hopefully it will work for the recipient of the book for me it was boring repetitive and disappointing after reading so much praise i have a lot of material to read and need to optimize the way i invest my time in a sense after the first couple of chapters i felt i was wasting my time reading this book i wish i had found steve pavlina 's brief review prior to purchasing optimal thinking i will give it 2 stars because it does contain useful ideas i do n't think so many pages are required to express these ideas
i too bought this book on the strength of the reviews here but i 'm incredibly disappointed the book should be titled thinking '' as all of its tips are pretty elementary in fact i recall learning many of them in elementary school if you have n't ever read any other or marketing books then this book might work for you but otherwise skip it
the winner and absolute truth made me continue reading baldacci last few books christmas train and split second were baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our was the last money i ever spend on a baldacci book i even threw out his good books shut up baldacci and write fiction books your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world
i liked it better than the hour game which was so slow i never finished it baldacci has unfortunately like other authors gotten a little preachy they disguise it as part of the story as if their readers do n't see it but there are whole sections that flash author 's message '' in neon lights first there are much subtler ways to send a message second i just do n't like being preached at no matter if i agree or disagree with the message i stopped reading tom clancy opposite view for just this reason
i found this book to be offensively the characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts the best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises i think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters
like a few others i do n't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews perhaps i was spoiled by memoirs of a geisha '' and the good earth '' but i found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring great plot line on paper but i do n't think the author did it justice ! could n't wait to just get through it and be done with it
i think the biggest problem with this book is that it was published and edited by his parents i admit i thought it was pretty bad in fact it was some of the worst fantasy i have ever read when a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff instead his parents went along with him
this is my first woods book and as a fan of this genre i was very disappointed the love story between cary and stone in this novel is one of the most unrealistic ridiculous ones i have ever read right before the rather dull and predictable climax stone dreams of marrying this woman and having kids with her why other than her apparent physical attributes and sexual prowess she offers nothing of substance by the end of the novel even before the incredibly predictable revelation of who pushed sasha she was an immensely unlikable person yet we are to believe that our handsome intelligent protagonist is in love with this woman come on ! ! ! the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because there were one or two plot twists early on that i found interesting even though i have a couple of woods paperbacks on my shelf i am not sure i will read him again if so i hope the next one is better than this mess
in addition to the fact that i too felt that i was enduring a commercial for dfa i was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of the only guide to a winning investment strategy you 'll ever need index mutual funds and beyond the way smart money invests today swedroe 's may 1998 book he introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations but if you 've read the first book there 's no reason to look at this one
first despite what the socialist apologists tell you walter rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some out of prison only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding come on it exploded in his lap for goodness sake mark hoffman tried that defense and it did n't get him anywhere either second championing the cause of the poor which rodney admittedly did is not the same as actually helping them or even more important for heua being a perceptive scholar rodney 's book is riddled with distortions fallacies and unsubstantiated premises one glaring example rodney pays practically zero attention to mediterranean africa for him only africa is the real '' africa why because his natural ethnic affinity for the area nothing wrong with that but then again you should n't title your book how europe underdeveloped africa '' but rather how europe underdeveloped africa '' rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman a straw man or almost anything other than the truth africa 's problems arise from its residents not from outside forces and spouting marxist dogma is n't going to change that fact it was known 25 years ago it 's known a fortiori now
i agree with one the comments posted below the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him over the course of the book he does n't change he 's unsympathetic and by the time we 've reached page 500 we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. i found myself dying to get to the end of this book just so i could start another book with some substance and some characters another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way overall i thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time
how could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction i am actually listening to the audio version and i am almost falling asleep and can not remember a word the reader has said i am going to stick to the movie versions of anne of green gables instead of reading the rest of the books at least the movies keep your interest
i am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book honestly it was a complete waste of my time to quote a friend it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar if you are a fan of pedestrian writing plots and hackneyed character development this is your book
some of the reacher novels such as the killing floor have been incredibly good but i was genuinely disappointed in this one the author describes reacher as heroic a loner but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told phrases such as back in the day '' get repeated much too often reacher has become a caricature of himself
a facsimile of the original edition '' my mother has an original copy edition which was handed down to her it is now held together with tape love borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so i wanted to get one for myself i did a lot of reading of reviews finally decided on this one yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without any cooking temperature electric gas or internal temps even the time tables on page 32 33 with cooking times did n't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at my mother 's does except the charts are in a different area of her book i am sorry but i am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book take my mother 's book write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at there was one recipe that state cook for 20 mins at a very high temp '' my mothers book said cook for 20 mins at 450 f '' it almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same copyrights problems i am returning this book because it did n't meet my expectations felt it was misrepresented
the tao te ching is a great book i 'm not giving that a one star review i 'm giving mitchell 's interpretation of it one star as many other reviews have stated he does n't speak chinese so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples ' translations and what he thinks it means he then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to century americans i like the old world feel of this book you do n't need to change swords to nuclear warheads i know what a sword is at least though this change makes sense some chapters mitchell changes so much that the entire chapter loses its meaning a couple chapters made no sense so i went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed and then i was able to understand exactly what lao tzu intended to say do n't buy this book
the stephen mitchell version of the tao te ching will please the philosophical bent and weltanschauung of certain modern and readers on points it is extremely spinozan to recognize that many readers will like it perhaps like it a great deal is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic ' translation because it is not to mitchell 's credit he acknowledges this after a fashion at least he thinks he is relating what lao tzu really meant to say to century readers certain century western readers may agree with mitchell but i expect that most scholars will not the prospective reader should be aware that this is the way of stephen mitchell which at least on some points is not the way of the ancient masters '' i strongly suggest that this not be the first or the only 'version ' of the tao te ching that you read in fact assuming that you prefer not to be misled i suggest that you do n't read it at all the authentic tao te ching is a fascinating text and challenging worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing this volume is n't
i started reading this book skipping the introduction and then realized this is n't the tao te ching at all this is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said and so he wrote his own version it turns out the author admits this in the introduction i wish i had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk i guess i should have taken the hint with the a new version '' doublespeak on the front cover sigh i usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs
the book is not even statistical by scientific standarts it is a vague collection of observations that tend to change every year this book has lost more money than it has made for people if you want to get serious about trading read toby crabel read linda rashke you do n't like to pay money for their books do n't expect a 30 book to tell you about making money it takes thinking hard labor and teachers like toby crabel
inane useless information from a speaker so boring i could hardly get through the 3 cd 's but felt like i had to since i had spent the money on them perhaps he is a great i can not see it i bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box i think this information was aimed at someone in grade school not a professional sales person
the content is full of valuable information on selling but this audio cd is not my favourite ziglar speaks so rapidly and ! i guess nobody speaks in this mannner i mean if you want listeners to enjoy your speech it is better to speak in a more natural pace occassionally there should be a pause ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this cd choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever ! slow down slow down ziglar ! give me some space to absorb your message ! i wish i can listen to your cd comfortably but i ca n't you read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works ziglar ! i am sorry i have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this cd
having read and enjoyed the author 's young adult book hoot and looking for a light adult read i picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light frankly it was both of thos things but within a hundred pages it became eminently easy to put down i enoy a diversion reading book periodically and have some adult writers that meet those needs thomas perry and harold adams to name two this one did n't make it for me it seemed to be a lot of given a hurricane one darn thing after another for a group of characters i did n't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together
i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training including the different levels snd i would have bought a manual i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing i got neither the characters were neither likeable nor substantive except for the cop next door i have no idea what they even look like or what if anything they care about besides dogs the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear maybe the series inmproves after this book i 'm not taking that chance
only of the book covers what a typical rich dad poor dad reader would expect how to use corporations to protect one 's assets the information in this section is really helpful and interesting especially for beginners the author provided great examples to illustrate key points the writing overall however could be improved by having better summaries of each chapter and by defining every new legal term used in the book for example the book never defined indemnification '' but it used it frequently another of the book covers how to start a company and take it public have it listed as a public stock i do n't think any typical rick dad poor dad reader has this purpose in mind for their businesses or real estate purchases so this second part of the book is utterly useless and irrelevant to most readers the last of the book basically lists the laws for incorporation for each state which is useful but i 'm sure the author could have provided a webpage to list all this information another thing to consider is that this book might be outdated it was published in 2001 and laws may have changed by now this review is written in early 2006 for example the policy of dividends was changed after the publication of this book i think the author might have overcome this by providing updates to important relevant laws through a website or something similar for all these reasons i 'd recommend the interested reader to explore other sources first unfortunately i ca n't recommend other books yet if there does n't seem to be any other good sources then consider reading this book only if you can buy it used or borrow it from the library
i know a lot of people liked this book but it did n't work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is they did n't there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin early on but no one does not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation
the plot is ridiculous the characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger we are supposed to believe that hank is a normal good '' person who commits evil acts out of necessity but really there are many other more logical steps that could be taken he continually chooses the immoral path i totally hate this book and the only reason i gave it two stars is because i am still reading it obviously if i hate it but continue to read it there is something in it that wo n't let me put it down maybe that was smith 's objective all along
a good book but not a great one the subject fascinates me so when i see a book at a discount bookstore in philadelphia title stigmata i pick it up the title and the cover intrigued me however harrison does not break any new ground here he uses modern day examples of people who have been given this gift from god he explains the migration of the stigmata from europe to america there have been several instances of people from the with the stigmata he also touches on the recent phenomena of other christians besides catholic christians receiving the stigmata the book is very easy to read and is neatly broken down into titled chapters so if you do n't want to read about cases from the past '' you can move straight to cases from the present '' without losing anything in other words you can read chapter six before you read chapter three and not get confused he does have an interesting chapter on how the medical profession views these phenomena he sites papers authored by medical doctors on spontaneous wounds and not just the stigmata type doctors do not have an explanation people under close medical observation have spontaneously received scars or burns for no reason very odd he mentions blushing '' as a very small example of this where an intense emotion triggers a visible physical response i gave the book only two stars because it did n't go into any depth on the subject i enjoyed parts but for the most part i knew this stuff prior to reading it i get a little annoyed after i finish a book and realize i did n't learn anything from it
it all depends on who you are if you will like this book republicans will like it but democrats or people with brains wo n't
bill o'reilly is a dinosaur that just does n't get it in this book he shows how he hates american gen x y culture its time to move on bill you are a dieing bread american culture is about diversity and variety it is always changing too bad his closed mind ca n't handle that the culture war is really close minded open minded people this was n't a very good book
i know this type of person i 've watched his unbearable tv show i ask why ca n't we all just get along being a peace lover and a church going christian his ways are very like jesus would not approve bill but luckily for you god is very forgiving attacking others is not very nice most of us learned that in kindergarten and i really wonder how traditional it is to hate others when you ca n't or wo n't comprehend what their lives are like perhaps we should go back to burning at the stake lynching or segregation to prove just how christian traditional and patriotic the united states really is do i need to remind you bill and your followers that this country was founded by men trying to escape persecution for believing something different life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens those who hate will love this book those with an open loving tolerant mind will know better
after i read this book i was siezed by an uncontrollable desire to pave my front yard
based on the advertisement at amazon this was the book in search of excellence it was not the book but an interview about the book i was very disapointed i still want the book on cd but feel it futal to try ordering it again on amazon as it is a nusance to order and return if you can help i would love to purchase the actual book on cd thank you steve kiewit 2543 770 623
i ca n't comment as to the author 's accuracy with regard to the magical characteristics of animals but i will say that conway needs to go back to high school and take introductory biology much of the information that she presents with regard to the biological and behavioral attributes of several animals is simply false how exactly is one to commune with animals when one is so astoundingly ignorant as to their nature why is it that all of these witches think that they 're also zoologists
this book could be so much better if it contained information about all the animals mentioned ! conway needs to do adequate research before writing and llewellyn needs to do their editorial homework before publishing her books
i was rather unimpressed by this book i 've read the bulk of books on animal magic and neopagan totemism that are currently available and this is one of the ones i advise people to avoid the research is less than adequate for instance she does n't seem to be able to tell the difference between a domesticated ferret and an ermine she says that ferrets change color seasonally while ferret coats may differ in shade a bit from shed to shed they do not have a brown phase and a white phase that 's the ermine in addition she says that the domestic ferret is bloodthirsty not so anyone who has owned ferrets knows that they have pretty much no survival instincts remaining a ferret released into the wild will be dead inside of a week do some research this entry is just one example in addition there are no citations stating where she got her information including the various questionable bits plus the entire feel of the book is rather shallow with little information of use that ca n't be found in better texts i 'd recommend ted andrews ' works for introductory totemism and jessica dawn palmer 's animal wisdom '' for an additional dictionary instead
quite possibly the worst book that i have ever read it is an infomercial from start to finish at least one comparison as to how efficiently target is managed compared to other stores actually proves the opposite of what the clueless author intends if you look at the numbers it is pure hype with no real value to anyone who graduated high school
the person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened i found this cookbook useful only if i changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half and doubling the amount of sugar my daughter did n't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book they were disgusting ! they were n't at all sweet and extremely fatty yuck ! i use the corn bread recipe all the time it 's excellent if you know what needs to be changed do not add any butter at all the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons and add cup of sugar the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon
i was enthusiastic about this book when i first scanned it at the bookstore later after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it i found it to be mediocre
this book is a wonderful celebration of the strength and lifetime beauty of the some marvelous women their images and insights give encouragement to women of all ages that the best is yet to come '' this would be a great book for a discussion group i first saw it in my doctor 's office the best part of the book is that it is real
i should have read the all of the reviews then at least i would have known i was getting a 30 page pamphlet i was extremely disappointed first anyone with more than a passing familiarity with dogs is away of the type of techniques presented in this book second virtually identical information was in a pamphlet that my vet has hanging on the wall which i picked up for free this past week when i had a dog there do n't get me wrong if you know nothing about dogs this is good starting information but for just maybe a dollar how is this called a book when the binding is staples holding together 15 folded pieces of paper
i had pretty high hopes for the book changing minds the art and science of changing our own and other people 's minds by howard gardner it looked like it would be a good book for learning the art of well changing peoples minds instead it was an academic journey that i found difficult to draw applications from contents the contents of the mind the forms of the mind the power of early theories leading a diverse population leading an institution how to deal with a uniform population changing minds indirectly through scientific discoveries scholarly breakthroughs and artistic creations mind changing in a formal setting mind changing up close changing one 's own mind epilogue the future of mind changing appendix notes index about the author gardner puts forth his theories of mind change based on three factors four entities '' of mind change stories theories concepts and skills six arenas '' of mind change from nations down to one 's own person and seven levers '' of mind change all words that start with re '' like reason resources and resonance he uses a number of examples from history to show how ideas and people were able to move others from one mindset to another on the surface it sounded like an interesting premise that i could apply in my activities and at times the writing almost succeeded there 'd be glimpses of the person behind the writing almost as if there was a conversation going on then there 'd be a retreat to academic analysis and pacing that made it a chore to slog through his attitudes and preconceptions are also quite evident for example he seems to hold darwin and his theories in high regard while denigrating fundamentalist '' christianity granted this was n't a book on keeping an open mind but i did n't quite want to be labeled as ignorant if i do n't happen to agree with him or hold the same views in life someone who is heavily into academic theory or the study of the human mind might well find this interesting but if you 're a busy professional looking for practical insights to work with this is going to be a real
gardner 's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations it 's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal he chooses the staggeringly bad examples of margaret thatcher george bush and bp ceo john browne as people who have successfully changed minds he does n't mention that thatcher and bush antagonized large sections of their countries ' populations completely failing to change their minds in fact hardening their positions of opposition in large part due to these leaders ' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies gardner lavishes praise on bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after without any mention of the pnac team that had already planned to invade iraq even before as for john browne his claim to have repositioned bp as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a texas refinery and the oil spill on the north slope that led to the admission that bp had n't done any of the work it was supposed to do on its pipelines another poor example is lawrence summers of harvard for some reason gardner does n't mention the biggest controversy summers was involved with when he said that women could never be as good at science as men gardner 's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers wo n't have heard of these professors and wo n't care much about their internal disputes it 's a shame gardner did n't tackle any problems such as how to change the minds of creationists gardner insists on using she '' and her '' instead of he '' and his '' as the neutral pronoun for political correctness and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on such as wetware '' and dryware '' for the internal workings of the brain and goodwork '' for being ethical at work yet another painfully banal concept in one section gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient 's dream to understand how the patient sees himself or should i say herself even if he was male in relation to others which sounds to me like total cod psychology but that 's just my own reaction to dream interpretations regarding computers gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people this again is utterly mistaken and it 's clear that gardner has next to no experience with the internet thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995 but gives no further justification of this claim anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that were n't possible before this technology existed for example or participating in a political discussion forum as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet gardner 's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with re '' for convenience eg resonance and resistance i had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book but all i learnt was that it was a bad book
i found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing after that it became a grind to endure gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum the author credits bill clinton with single handedly coming up with mend it do n't end it '' for welfare yet does not explain how the republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action darwin is treated as an infallible truth yet gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms the various truths '' that are allowed to exist like the stages of the human embryo fish primate with tail and the lack of any new species the author does have some interesting ideas yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes see the part on george bush fails to allow us the readers to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them so how do i change minds
changing minds is very disappointing average to very poor writing poor development of ideas ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs and very little substance you will learn very little about how to change anyone 's mind or your own reading this book and finishing it is a grind
i admit i only read the first hundred or so pages then skimmed the rest as lincoln once observed you do n't have to eat the whole egg to know it 's rotten it seems to me the first half of the book is filled with gardner arguments trying to illustrate how complicated his science has become so that the author can spend the rest of the book proposing solutions but i doubt seriously that very many people lead quotidian lives anywhere near as complicated as the author makes out
i found this book disappointing its pages drag on and on but never deal with the topic it addresses why but not the how i was looking for the how
i borrowed changing minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion the book is mostly write ups that are not other reviews say 'where is the proof
harvard psychologist howard gardner 's book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull written by a qualified professional in the field the book is another output of the impressive harvard business school press the book advances the view that there are seven what it calls layers '' or levers '' that affect a change of opinion these factors whose titles all begin with ' are world events and rewards and redescriptions gardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution among a population up close or as relate 's to one 's own mind so far so good many would say alas the reader is compelled to add what ' to the phrase changing minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author 's conclusions furthermore being the work of a researcher in an academic setting readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques rather changing minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis in this manner the book is very much a scholastic paper finally there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings little proof research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers ' resistances similarly dismissed is the need for charts illustrations indented or highlighted points or synopses furthermore and more ominously the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect he claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data he does not provide any supporting data either in fact the contrary is true schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence obedience and group activity barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory a law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws similarly imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of world war ii an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or at an elementary level a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders let me quote from the book while gardner cites the example of george w bush following september 11 2001 many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind the us president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his agenda much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the american president and his officials ' overt and covert ideas and strategies gardner terms the new bush a multilateralist '' ! uncomfortably 132 sovereign countries and a lack of support from the united nations would disagree moreover despite such fierce opposition bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless further down the pages the author condemns stalin 's pact with hitler as cronyism '' he conveniently forgets or omits the allies ' earlier pact with hitler or the west 's subsequent treaty with the extremely paranoid '' stalin in short being a tenured academic gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance lacking the appeal of practicality the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events changing minds the art and science of changing our own and other people 's minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book
eugene o'neill 's play long day 's journey into night '' is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends no happy ending no hope for the future just despair long day 's journey into night '' is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without however after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play o'neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right and that the family is tense slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth although i still believe long day 's journey into night '' to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing
eugene o'neill may have been the father of american theatre but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in long day 's journey into night o'neill 's characters were shallow pathetic and seemed to have great relationship between james tyrone and his son jamie is meanspirited and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems tyrone regularly refers to jamie as a useless failure and a drunk not only to his face but to other family members and in turn jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son edmund tyrone says such things as you 'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life ! and comments to edmund that if he 's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey he 's never shown '' the characters of the parents are pathetic the mother all fluttery and drugged and the father as the stereotypical old cheap and mean failed celebrity the only seemingly normal relationship is between edmund and jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love the relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds it is as if they entire family is bipolar long day 's journey into night was based on the life of o'neill himself with the character of edmund as o'neill the mother of o'neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between o'neill and his older brother and his father never accepted o'neill for who he was these sad beginnings continued throughout the life of o'neill and was evident in the writing of this piece if the characters in long day 's journey into night are closely based on his family members then o'neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine
flowery verbose rambling compound sentence upon compound sentence this book was unreadable for me i quit
ben franklin is my hero i have 12 biographies on him this was the worst i first started collecting franklin biographies forty years ago van doren fay issacson brands wood and a half a dozen others at first glance and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different a new take that concentrated on france well it was new and very different it put me to sleep in my chair several times i eventually gave up and shelved it with the others what a shame boring
i 'm giving up on this book it reads like a first draft sentences like the following on page 71 abound when you hear not so often as you wish remember our silence means our safety '' the committee of secret correspondence now doing business as the committee for foreign affairs although franklin who had never mastered the original name was not to know for months soothed the envoys whom they understood to be starved for news schiff needed a good editor but did n't get one this certainly is n't pulitzer grade material i wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the anniversary of franklin 's birth van doren in his biography gives a better account of franklin 's years in paris
it 's a long read the characters are boring and the ending makes no sense at all it is neither funny nor thrilling it 's just plain dull
it always amazes me how seemingly intelligent people can become so irrational when it comes to their religious beliefs this feeble attempt to show how new theories in science point to a god is nothing new ontological and cosmological proofs '' for god have been around for a long time and this book offers nothing new i have a phd in physics and have met many other scientists and have shared thoughts on this subject i must say the editors and sample scientists views are not representative of most it seems obvious the editors picked those scientists who held similar views sure they chose a few token agnostics the only way i could recommed this book is for a laugh and the simple wonder of how the comfort of religion can corrupt even a well disciplined scientific mind
being a fan of such authors as tolkien wells and lewis i figured i 'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the american west a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining i did some research and cormac mccarthy seemed to be the author to start with he got very good reviews from this site and professional critics i find it amazing that he received such great reviews this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit the book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly unexpectedly return to it i have never read a book like that before after completing this book i had found out more about the life of a prostitute than i ever wanted to know and also i received a free lesson in swearing i understand that it was custom in the west to swear and dealings with prostitutes was common but i think mccarthy went over the top this made it uninteresting and redundant then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods question marks and exclamation marks i did not see a single quotation mark and the word and '' was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly sentences were monotonous after reading this book i also felt ignorant being uneducated in the spanish language much of the dialogue i could not understand in the least bit there were entire conversations written exclusively in spanish at times when it seemed relevant i felt like i missed a lot of important information in the story i did find that at time mccarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me i do n't suppose i 'll ever read a book by cormac mccarthy again
reichheld has impressive credentials and i respect his intentions yet in this book he recommends using surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty that 's extremely misleading ! that process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are the only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts ! reichheld has missed the mark
this book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the dot com boom was at its zenith shortly before the crash interestingly there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon lewis ' liar 's poker '' was extremely enjoyable particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players in this book lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character the tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to clark 's disciples as the smartest '' best '' greatest '' and most ingenious '' individuals in their various fields what strains credibility however is the attribution of all clark 's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and beliefs of others history will probably not judge clark as charitably as lewis especially since most of the clark 's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their dot com era glory most notably sgi netscape and healtheon throughout the book jim clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between 3 and 4 billion the list of 2004 forbes 400 richest in america shows jim clark with an approximated net worth of 700 million for a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of oracle 's larry ellison today clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation billionaire
currently i own two ps books one by scott kelby photoshop for digital photographers and the other one is this one i must say they are two extremes the one from scott is too simple and he does n't go into why you 're doing something it 's more like a tips and tricks books this book on the other hand is too much information scattered around in different chapters i find it very confusing and difficult to read especially when the author makes unrelated examples to throw you off i spent much time reading the chapter about writing curves but i still could not understand the correct way to write my own rather than follow his overall i think this book is very which makes finding a specific topic difficult
i was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program god i wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time i was finished with it if you want to read great photographic essays try bill jay 's work amazing insightful and filled with a sense of humor
i opened this book very neutrally i had never heard anything about susan sontag except her name in a preface to an annie leibovitz book i still ca n't believe some of the things i read sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an obsession '' with photography i would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography she begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape to a certain point i can understand this being photographed is a very experience but somehow i think rape victims would laugh at this comparision is not exactly rape also she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject s they are innocent victims being raped by guns the last time i checked most of the photographers she mentions diane arbus richard avedon edward weston julia margaret cameron took pictures only with express permission and many eugene atget ansel adams etc did not take pictures of people at all almost all good pictures with the exception of henri type photography requires tacit consent between photographer and subject sontag 's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography 's replacement of writing in description specifically she says that whereas photograpy steals '' the pain of others writing uses only one 's own pain this is funny since i remember reading about how jane austen 's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been stealing '' other people 's lives their pain etc fitzgerald used zelda 's insanity just as david bailey photographed marie helvin i believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar and sontag sounds very sour grapes how is strand 's photographing the famous blind woman '' different from truman capote 's in cold blood '' my biggest objection to sontag however is her lack of either proof or explanation she simply states opinions as if they were facts and then stops for example according to sontag weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche really somehow i thought considering the worth of his work his exhibitions in museums and the wealth of books devoted to him as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class that he was still very highly regarded i 'm sure that sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche but this is very different from the everyone '' she generally to be present and in full agreement with her sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre diane arbus 's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them and are freakish visions of a bleak world therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world i can understand why some people find arbus 's photos terribly offensive but i think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography one last aspect of sontag 's book which i found the most offensive is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and in a sense profiting from it artistically this is despite her inclusion in her anthology of quotations '' of richard avedon 's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement hence my conclusion that sontag has probably never really picked up a camera look at avedon 's pictures of a tortured marilyn monroe and then read arthur miller 's after the fall '' which describes a tortured and marilyn monroe there is very little difference except that in avedon 's pictures monroe still retains some amount of dignity whereas in miller 's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty in the end although i am both a photographer and a writer i would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and stealing the pain of others '' than does photography
sontag represents a certain type of intellectual '' who is thankfully becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband as exemplified by descartes i think therefore i am this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination without doing any research without experimentation without any investigation of the world outside of your skull it is pure subjectivity gloriously and egotistic completely and titannically what sontag 's writings are about are sontag not the world as it is and which can easily be fact checked but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of sontag 's ego and self sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic the world outside of her own mind does n't matter and facts have no weight this is what enabled her in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years to praise the terrorists for bravery while the world trade center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris this was like praising the nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely no matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings she took the very cheap easy and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world without ever offering any solutions and always always condemning the usa for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of verlaine rimbaud and genet in photography sontag is at the acme of her witch craft she thinks and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability sanity or common sense it does n't she 'll be forgotten i think she would have appreciated that joining the obscure writers that few people read enjoyed or valued she was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses
what a load of garbage equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed she has no idea waht she is talking about
i have read a lot of michael crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting after just finishing travels '' this afternoon i have to admit that i hated it i know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books i have ever read he whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship instead of looking at the international travel as little as he actually talks about it as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are he is continually belittling and condescending his only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is for all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere one of ego centered self indulgences nice try but highly frustrating and he should have kept this one to himself
there are adventures throughout the world if you can write well you can share those adventures with others michael crichton can write well with the clear exception of state of fear and he shares his adventures his travels '' these travels are his travels through medical school in search of adventure in places and his search for the power of the mind '' my words not his two sections bother me a lot one is his search for that power of the mind '' for example bending spoons with the power of thought although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow after bending his own spoon he says great ! no need to search for any explanation '' the travel analogy would be what you suddenly appear in china and the path to get there is not important strike one as crichton hangs around with friends '' interested in pursuing sex with children in thailand he states he is not interested but boys will be boys '' again my words strike two and i 'm sorry state of fear strike three michael crichton you are out
a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton 's whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books
i was enjoying the travel parts of the book despite numerous detours of behavior by crichton until i reached the part where he was in bangkok he teams up with a journalist for a night on the town his journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area 's many brothels finally after testing the waters the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and suggests a child whorehouse crichton does n't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him instead he goes and checks the place out he gives a description of tarted up girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes perhaps i 'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile i did n't expect crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex was n't his thing instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him this infuriated me and turned my stomach i threw the book in the trash i wish publishers had done the same fyi there is no zero star option
i 'm a big nora fan but i could n't even finish this one by the fourth chapter i began to skim way way way to much detail for me which made it boring and slow testing and corrosion is it fake is it real blah blah blah enough ! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother i forget his name but thats it folks unlike all the other reviewers i hated it i say pass on this one but as you can see i 'm in the minority
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
i received a book that i did n't even order the one i ordered is yellow and white edition this is n't the one i ordered therefore i need a sent the book back and i know the seller received it on
having worked in the mental health community for sometime i was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already i felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone i would n't purchase it again his companion book why employees do n't do what they 're supposed to do and what to do about it '' is a more practical read and enjoyable too i would recommend that one
i ordered this book hoping for the correct listed size 19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches what i got was the smaller nearly one third the price version ! when i sent it back for a replacement stating that is was the incorrect size they sent me the exact same book in return i did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them not once but twice ! i would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book do so with caution if you do measure it to be sure it is the correct size oterwise you can order the less expensive smaller verion and get the same exact same book while saving money good luck and i hope this review helps you
save your money for something more useful there is nothing in this book that makes it worth the price a far better book on bear market investing is riding the bear '' by sy harding and for concepts about timing the market and investing both long and short see les masonson 's all about market timing '' and deborah wair 's timing the market
the collage of voices '' approach endemic to oral history leads in this case to a frustrating almost indigestible mess dave marsh warns in his editor 's note to the for the record series of which this volume is a part if an artist is n't especially interested in what happens in the recording studio but has a fascination with what happens in hotel rooms after live gigs that 's what you 'll get '' so instead of getting more than the barest glimpse inside the studio during the recording of there 's a riot going on surely one of the deepest albums in all of american popular music history we are given page after page devoted to the band 's sex lives taste in drugs and even their surprising if unilluminating avocation as collective dog fanciers really ! what 's missing literally is sly 's voice which leaves a gaping hole in the center of the narrative by connecting the dots one can glean a few insights about the music from the mass of bleary anecdotes herein but are n't authors and editors supposed to do that for you if you 're in the market for a mess of depressing gossip this will be your meat if you 're seeking insight into the man 's and the group 's brilliant music look elsewhere
i do n't have academic training on philosophy argument and thus the book becomes a long and winding essay that is difficult to grasp you can read the first chapter from http and see if this is the kind of books you would like
this book is horrible i learned nothing the only points that were reasonable were those that everyone already knows useless and pretentious
in my opinion as a this book is poorly written the book gives examples on financial calculations that can be done to determine if a piece of property is a good investment however the examples given are either too complex to be meaningful outside of the specific situtation or too simple to gain any understanding the second section of the book on case studies '' is not made for new investors the examples involve huge sums of money and very complex situations two examples come to mind one case study discussed buying an apartment complex in an overpriced area another rambled on about legal trouble he had with a local zoning board a simpler more straight forward example of properties would be much more valuable i also did not appreciate the fact that his company is plugged throughout the book i guess it offers some value in that he has actually experienced the situations in the book but i can not help but think this book was written only for the benefit of his company and not to eduate the readers i have read many real estate books written by many successful investor who never mention their company 's name he mentions his constantly this book may make sense for investors with large cash reserves in that it explains some creative ways to identify ways to improve a property and it is written from real experience but in general i do not recommend it
i purchased this book with good intentions and have never written a negative review on a book but i had to go out of my way to make note on this book although i can see how others could find value in the book the author lost his credibility with me after two chapters of me underlining statements he was making that he stated as fact when they were just his opinion i wo n't get into every detail but for example he classifies real estate investors as or long term and then states the long term investor wo n't care about purchase price '' what is he talking about and then fails to understand the fact a long term investor can capture appreciated gains through monetizing the asset the house through additional equity lines or refinances rather than state this simple fact which is very important as it would allow a long term investor to avoid transaction costs and tax implications but still receive cash from the appreciation he states the long term investor will hold the home not very leveraged that is totally untrue many long term investors are highly leveraged and continually borrow against their properties and appreciation anyway not a big deal but atleast he did n't call his book the bible to real estate finance '' or something like that because it is not it is a great subject matter and topic and he stated he may be one of the few people to have written a book on this narrow topic for a lay person but the book lacks a professional polished work take it for what you can get out of it and question things
do n't waste your money on this book it has ridiculous errors on almost every page that any fan is going to recognize immediately it 's like a book someone would write about a subject they have no real interest in just for money do n't contribute
this book offers absolutely nothing new and does n't seem to offer anything new or substantive this is as bad as the biography of bono by that woman ack
every review up to now is positively many of them use similar language and of the 'reviewers ' have ever written a review for any other book amazon has been not the first time this is a book you ca n't find in the 'bricks and mortar ' stores to scan it before buying so reviews are all that the potential buyer has to go on when all of the reviews are fraudulant i must assume that the book is too if you 'search inside ' you 'll find a testimonial from 'lisa oborn ' who like and her reviewers has no apparent existance outside of this book her linked website does not exist and she is mentioned in other sources as being the author 's partner if she exists at all too much but i 'll give the mysterious ms 'oborn ' credit for one thing she mentions graham whom i know to be real as evidenced by his record of books tapes lectures conferences classes treatments and a perpetually youthful physique to back his system up go straight to the source
because that 's how he makes his money and fame without it he 'd be known for what he ultimately is a poor charlatan posing as a scholar
i found this book hard to follow his arguments were n't always clear and honestly i felt like he was using big words '' to impress his readers i 'll give him one thing passion i could feel how passionate he was about his topic but all in all a book
i had to force myself to get through this book due to a philosophy assignment i had to write on it the payoff was that i got to write a 6 page critique of it at the end that 's where i shined this book is just dying to be criticised the way it was written to put it plain and simple race matters is a book written by a racist he is so and and from what i could tell he was leaning toward i was thouroughly disgusted page after page of negativity and no solutions in sight not to mention errors and that absolute absence of footnotes to back up any of his statements or information if you are going to read this book make sure you have google handy you are going to need it i would like to say you should also have a dictionary handy but alot of words you wo n't find in the dictionary why might you ask would they not be in the dictionary maybe because he was making them up that was my best guess there has to be better material out there than this i urge you to find it
i guess albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but i 'm done with him at least i can say i never paid for any of his oprahlit just wasted time at a library please do n't make this huckster one cent richer buy something more edifying like toilet paper
i hate to be the 'dog in the manger ' on this one but i found this book very irritating not so much in that it 's a particularly badly written book it 's not but its incredible popularity is more an indictment of it 's fans rather than it 's creator mitch ablom books in general and for one more day '' in particular are popular for the same reasons mcdonalds olive garden celine dion and tom cruise are popular they provide a mass audience baby boomers in particular with a predictable easily digestable intellectually nonthreatening and utterly mediocre product for one more day '' is tailored to the worst in the whiny baby boomer generation as the boomers age they greet the almost universal midlife themes of dissapointment and regret as if they were the very first people to ever experience those emotions and make a huge deal of broadcasting and analyzing their feelings to death who does n't reach middle age and not feel some regret that they did n't write the great american novel marry the homecoming or start a fabulously successful i guess with the baby boomers it 's a particularly bitter pill because they were brought up from the to believe they were mitch ablom has tapped this rich vein of boomer angst to great success his protagonist 'chick ' benetto is a ball player with a broken marriage and a drinking problem in a fit of he tries to kill himself and botches that one too he meets his dead mom acknowleges he has been a real poop and finds redemption cue the string section and loosen the tear ducts oh gag me ! ! ! ! even some of his 'novel ' plot devices are nothing new anyone who has read an incident at owl creek bridge '' by ambrose bierce will be spitting nails at ablom 's shameless cribbing of the books main twist the book itself is a childishly easy read ablom is no great artist with the english language and no one with greater than a reading ablily will be taxed by this one faulkner eco and melville can rest easy the baby boom generation has never been known for it 's intellectual horsepower and this book is for the oprah nation a lightweight tome for a lightweight society
the 2 stars is the average i give to all the fable books written by patrick the five dysfunctions of a team 5 stars obviously it is the best one you can see it from the sales record in amazon it was the first patrick 's book i read i have finished reading the whole book in one setting and could n't wait and jump to look for his other books the book has a reasonable length setting up a bit simplified but not and still reasonable setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills the whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read highly recommended ! death by meeting a leadership fable 4 stars it is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions a very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them i recommend you buy one read it and keep it as a reference one drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he did n't take his pills i never work with such an unusual person and i prefer less dramatic in a management fable not something like in desperate housewife '' the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her chinese maid to bear her baby i should have stopped here and never rush to read his other the four obsessions of an extraordinary executive 2 stars this is the one made me begin to feel betrayed if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months this one seems to be done within weeks the fable setting needs more polishing works although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot scenarios like how the vp hr plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers not mentioning for managers the rough plot affects the whole four points though four very good points i will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore five temptations of ceo 1 star it is the one makes me begin to feel angry again if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months this one seems to be done within hours the major story 95 of the book happened in a dark train where a poor ceo was taught about these five temptations by some old men who turned out later to be the previous ceos in the same company ! again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points it is the plot that made me sick if you have a chance skim the whole book in less than five minutes silos politics and turf wars negative 1 star the worst one negative 1 star is because it wasted my time i thought the five temptation one was the worst until i read this one patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution and he even spends many pages about the main character 's struggle in balancing his work and his wife 's pregnancy which i believe should belong to another fable about personal life balance given how many pages the author devoted to this from other fables more or less you can at least learn something but not from this one forget it !
i was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books especially five dysfunctions of a team which is one of the most elegant frameworks i 've seen on team dynamics lencioni 's solution to silos and politics a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics it 's a lot more complex than just that and i 'm surprised he did n't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem if you 're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization keep
i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title i read this book because it was the subject of an book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group
i read a 200 page allegory to learn what was summarized in the last 25 pages there is not much substance here and not much to indicate whether the method described in the book is proven
borrow the book from the library wasting your money on fables is not wise unless you like wasting money while entertaining this is not worthy of a library collection item
i 'm sorry generally i 'm a fan of business stories but this one really missed the mark in attempting to bring a sense of realism to his characters it seems he focused too much on story plot and character development and not enough on the mechanics of politics and providing real examples of how to deal with it from all levels i want take back to my desk '' application this book fell short
in the beginning of this book i found it a bit disturbing however i pressed on and i was glad i soon came to be highly disappointed by this book though because it seemed so in the fact that almost every drugged out junkie seems to find a god and heal themselves then discuss it for 15 chapters aside from that fact almost of the book was about doing various drugs i felt it was drug out too long and could have been summed up in fewer chapters it got to be monotonous and tiresome reading about the authors junkie habits over and over again although the book had great potential and could have been one of the greats i felt it became monotonous
this is a terrible book with a terrible message that you should use the understanding of other cultures in order to infiltrate and change them that is not the message of anthropology as an anthropologist i resent this book profoundly anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures interest in their own ways of being and believing and the concept of cultural relativism that a culture 's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms the one thing we do not do is try to impose our own truths '' on others if missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is then read an anthropology book but this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment invasion and destruction it is arrogant and misguided
this book is less about carnegie than it is about the homestead plant 's labor unrest and on this topic the author is an unabashed labor partisan he unfailingly calls replacement workers scabs '' routinely uses inflamatory language like crumbs for the angry masses '' or pigheaded '' to describe carnegie and his partners nasaw reveals little about what made carnegie such a spectacular business success evidently he was lucky and had the gift of gab '' the fact that carnegie 's efficient plants resulted in steady employment for thousands and cheaper steal for a growing economy is dismissed as propaganda for the rich industrialist nasaw never explains why striking workers at homestead had the right to blockade carnegie 's agents from entering the site in his view they had such a right by virtue of their work and hence bore no responsibility for the ensuing violence the rule of law does n't seem to play much role in his thinking
it is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now coulter 's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like coulter rail against she will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince audiences of something they already want to believe pitiful rants here if you are in it for fun or do n't care that you are getting a skewed sensationalist opinion maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store but for something better why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed analytical approach rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst on both right and left that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with
when i first bought it for myself and skimmed the first few pages i was very excited about the book and thought that it would be a worthwhile read as i kept reading though it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book and did n't have much worthwhile information to say he constantly repeats that he is showing you how to get rich '' without providing any substantive advice he repeats lists that have little or no value including things like work hard '' over and over again from the outside in it seems great but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book all of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs i find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book do yourself a favor and read the better books out there like clason 's the richest man in babylon
i never reveived this book the nancy drew came in the mail but that is it who do i need to contact
let me get myself straigh here first i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins i loved the first one and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies instead of saving them from some kind of evil '' foe also the fairies were pretty cool and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism they were high tech and armed with laser guns unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz now let me rewiew this particular book its a horrible read who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts no me now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd i mean seriously a barbie '' doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they 're boys how old is the author anyways two years old well obviously he 's not married thats for sure i always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds not four year olds anyways enough of that the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father i read colfer because he writes futuristic books that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who does n't even solve robberies instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war all of the wicked humor is lost there is no action whatsoever the main charecter is n't a genius with wicked humor and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others heavily downgraded adn obviously the worst parts do not even read this thing get some other artemis fowl books or read alex rider thats a very good read
a daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the rocket trip to the moon that 's the premise of heinlein 's rocket ship galileo readers who are n't immediately turned off by the story 's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure to begin with heinlein 's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years he skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place and he even manages to build some suspense an effect heinlein is not usually noted for his descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting despite being badly dated one real letdown is the characters who are curiously undeveloped even for science fiction the three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable and doctor cargraves is n't much more distinctive if some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities the readers might find them easier to identify with as it is it 's hard to really care about these characters even when something horrible happens to them the really big problem though is that this book really has n't aged very well for example heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately by one scientist and his youthful helpers working on a shoestring budget after a few months of labor when after all any schoolchild knows that it took nasa and the government billions of dollars working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade to accomplish the real thing once our heroes reach the moon the story gets even more improbable as they find that the moon is already inhabited naturally heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible as such it was written for the tastes of the times and times have changed dramatically for instance the only women in this book are the boys ' mothers who have very little to say about anything important the villains are cartoonish stereotypes who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse although the book is reasonably overall and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet today 's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing on average if you 're old enough to remember sputnik you can be forgiven for loving this book but if neil armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school you probably wo n't be too impressed by rocket ship galileo
but does n't really touch anything the new digital shooter would be interested in if you 're shooting film and you 're looking for a simple primer on it 's not too bad be warned it 's a pretty basic book apart from a good few pages on tricks with flashlights and one or two truely stunning photos it 's a generally pedestrian take on the subject digital shooters are advised to look elsewhere
i have all of her previous books and i have to admit that i am getting a little tired of her cookbooks i have used her first two books numerous times and the recipes are no fail however with the more recent ones and especially this last one i am beginning to fill that her repertoire needs some refreshing there is nothing new and exciting here and i have encountered and excecuted extremely close version of these recipes from a number of other writers let us hope for something better in the future
being a big fan i could hardly wait to get my hands on her latest unfortunately there is nothing new and nothing exciting in this cookbook there are three recipes for broccoli yes 3 ! a repeat recipe for roasted cherry tomatoes as if one recipe was n't enough and a recipe for roasted onion quarters to be served as a side dish yuck ! these examples were definitely the for me but as i flipped through the cookbook there was nothing that jumped out at me i was completely underwhelmed to end on a positive it is a pretty book
maybe it was just the recipes i tried first from this book orange honey glazed carrots brocolini and balsamic vinaigrette mustard roasted potatoes but her recipes are inundated with salt to the point that my kids usually salt lovers cried out too much salt '' and would n't eat them i could n't have misread three recipes by mismeasuring and i wo n't try any more items from this book that call for salt a major disappointment if you are hypertensive stay away from this book it could be dangerous to your health
while i find as most people do ina garten 's television personality to be very likable her just released cookbook barefoot contessa at home '' is both disappointing and not true to its title ina garten is not an original nor a trained cook she is someone who found cooking to be much more pleasurable than working in washington as an energy analyst and that i can certainly understand garten with the support of her husband parlayed this interest into a business a business that she took over and built up catering to the wealthy hamptons ' crowd who preferred to have their cooking done for them and do n't care how much it costs garten 's first cookbook is probably her best with each new cookbook it became more clear that she just did n't have that many recipes in her all of her books follow the same format very few recipes simple and easy to execute generally heavy on butter and cream often expensive ingredients beautiful and ample photographs big price tag for what you get the recipes ring with a saminess about them they also reflect the positive influence of anna pump and sarah lee chase not to mention all those junior league cookbooks many of the recipes in this book are things most home cooks already make without benefit of a cookbook garlic croutons tomato feta salad guacamole salad '' blue cheese coleslaw potato salad blue cheese burgers lemon fusilli with arugula summer garden pasta garlic and herb tomatoes glazed carrots buttermilk mashed potatoes creamy rosemary polenta herb roasted onions potatoes and sunday morning oatmeal '' same recipe just change the ingredients does not make a new cookbook or at least it should not there is also a lot of borrowing going on here while inspiration '' may be cited i say go to the original source for usually the best with that i highly recommend dorie greenspan 's baking from my home to yours '' for desserts ina is a niche market lifestyle over substance easy recipes served in a highly fashionable hampton 's home with china sterling linens and serving pieces to die for it may be the barefoot contessa at home but for most of us easy lobster paella '' will never see the light of our kitchens and i do n't need ina to tell me how to make oatmeal or croutons
hope edelman 's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study she has chosen a narrow scope for her research and that 's fine that is until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them the second hole in edelman 's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones where the basis for this statement i 'll believe it when i see it it 's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships what 's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just do n't matter as much within the context of her thesis they are not as significant but this is something that edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she did n't write about them because they are not as significant other than these two crucial holes edelman 's book holds merit in its accounts of family both from her own life and from her case studies it 's worth a read not so much for its actual insights but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own
i picked up the audio book from the library and did n't know by the title and author 's name my first jance book that this was chick lit i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known it started real well and jance knows how to reel you in with her writing midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor and then about her friend who died of als and then came the long responses to the blogs it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama
this is jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help
please save your money ! the so called heroine '' was so annoying i sided with the bad guy enough said
this is a book by ja jance this book took a potentially good storyline plot and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style which is unlike ja jance this book seemed to be to be written for a reader audience i had to force myself to read it all the way through because i must admit i was curious as to the conclusion but i did not derive any pleasure from reading this book a waste of time
i own and have read all of ja jance 's jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character 's lives i picked this book up thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i 've read previously what a crashing disappointment i ca n't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations truth be told i kept looking at the cover to see if i 'd picked up a harlequin by mistake i 'll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series but i 'd much rather see what happens with jp and joanna incidentally i did n't think much of either of them either when their paths crossed some books ago this one gets a big aw c'mon ja you can do much better than this ! '' from me for those who have n't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning they are worth the time and effort
it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat then do n't waste your time jo
a bit cheesey i felt like i was reading a fluffed up book ! if you are a fan of the da vinci code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine this book will be of little help i bought it because i thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts but i found it to be a simplistic repetetive account of a woman 's rebirth '' i could n't even finish it ! while its okay as a light read it wo n't satisfy your want of solid information
i also have had to find my spiritual path at some point many women wake up '' and take ownership of their own selves i did this at age 35. i chose to become a member of the baptist southern church because their doctrine was sound if you read what their beliefs are it 's all found in the bible i know women dislike being linked to eve '' but you either believe the bible as truth or you do n't there is no middle ground if any part of the bible is n't inspired '' then it 's all bunk so i say you 're either a christian belief in jesus as the only way to heaven or you are n't that was easy huh why do we need a book
if you are n't familiar with women 's studies and feminism you really should read this book it 's a great overview and if you have n't studied this material before you will find her research very interesting however anyone who has taken a college level women 's studies course will be bored to tears by this book she provides a summary of the accepted cannon of feminist works and authors all of which i had previously encountered her actual journey of awakening due to her former religious views is interesting enough but did n't have me glued
sue monk kidd was raised in the conservative south she went to charm school several of the men in her family are baptist ministers and for many years she earned a living as an inspirational christian writer get the picture for most of her adult life kidd never questioned her faith or her femininity that is not until she witnessed an episode of sexual harassment involving her teenage daughter following this incident kidd gradually began to realize that the church and society are patriarchal systems the first part of this book deals with kidd 's awakening while the second part of this book deals with her evolving faith while i have a lot of respect for kidd 's willingness to question herself and her deepest beliefs her book was of virtually no use to me i think my background has a lot to do with my disinterest i 'm a good 20 years younger than kidd and i 've considered myself a feminist '' since i was about 2 years old so all of these bright ideas that kidd was having they really go without saying for me i mean her realizations that women are not second to men and that we have been socialized '' to believe certain things about gender well these are notions that have been explored and about a zillion times anyone with even a remote understanding of feminist theory is going to be really bored by the first half of this book which is primarily devoted to her awakening with that said if you are not very in feminism or if you come from a really conservative background like kidd her awakening might be of interest to you personally i found the second half of the book a bit more interesting as kidd talked occasionally about the history of christianity and the history of women in the church i definitely learned some new things however i imagine that there are more useful books that explore the history of women and christianity unfortunately i do not know of any at this time there are 3 additional complaints i have with this book 1. kidd overuses metaphors ! do n't get me wrong it 's not that i 'm not a poetic '' type i was an english major in college it 's just that she uses metaphors to the point that they become tedious this book should have been edited a bit more carefully 2. throughout this text kidd frequently describes her dreams i find this really frustrating because her dreams '' are so evidently contrived does anyone really believe that kidd had a dream in which she crawled into the empty lap of a statue and that the virgin healed her wounds all of her dreams are relevant to her spiritual journey i felt manipulated each time i read about one 3. she talks a lot about the devine feminine and uses a lot of female language that 's great i think it 's really important that christians counter the descriptions of the divine god father he however kidd also talks frequently about the feminine soul '' i think it 's dangerous to assign a specifically feminine '' soul to all women this implies that there is something inherently feminine '' about women and their spirituality and something inherently masculine '' about men and their spirituality does this not counter the very idea that women are to be feminine and men are to be masculine i think it does and along those same lines kidd frequently describes specifically feminine rituals or moments of feminine worship almost every time these rituals and moments of worship have to do with nature or maybe with spontaneous dancing or singing it seemed to me that she was describing women as somehow more natural '' and earthly '' than men this is certainly not a new idea for centuries women have been associated with the earth and base instincts while men have been associated with the divine and more spiritual and intellectual pursuits and while i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad thing to bring the earth and nature back into christianity i think kidd is making a big mistake in her implication that women specifically are connected to the earth in summary if you are in a situation similar to the situation kidd was in when she had her awakening and would like to learn more about a woman 's journey this would be an okay book for you though i really only recommend it but if you already have a general understanding of feminism or if you are put off by the notion that women are earthly '' i would n't recommend this book
how to save money and time do n't but this book '' this book is useless to the average person it only deals with the 1 or 2 of people that need to hide their assets and his methods are so impractical renting out a broom closet in a building for a mail slot he even says that you might need to lie on a postal application which is against the law do get what you need and there are too many stories from newspapers that are the most extreme circumstances he had one good chapter about identity theft and shredding your documents but the rest is realy far fetched do not buy this book even if you needed kindling it 's that bad
temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the chapter
after many years i decided to finally give kathy reichs ' temperance brennan series a go so where better to start than her debut novel 'deja dead ' which introduces reichs ' heroine temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist working in montreal for what i 'm guessing is the equivalent of a medical examiner 's office of course our heroine is head strong independent and unlucky in love are n't they all well some murders start turning up and amazingly enough our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together do the police believe her no so she must investigate the crimes on her own and by doing so the murderer then turns his attention to brennan and her family and friends do n't all killers eventually do that first off the book is bloated the book at least the paperback version clocks in at about 530 pages reichs ' writes too much about menial tasks that her character brennan does during her usual day does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work i know i do n't want to read it now i 'm a person who enjoys a nice long book but 'deja dead ' where did she get that title anyway is about two hundred pages too long and it is a very slow read secondly her main character brennan just is n't likeable in fact i found her quite annoying the policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing when in fact i think that they just did n't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs reichs ' tries to portray brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal when in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder she is basically a employee who should not be in the field so i do n't blame the cops in the book that do n't like her she 's butting her nose in where it does n't belong and in a part i actually liked she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends i thought it a just outcome also after about the twentieth time of brennan looking at some cop 's rear end and saying i like the way his butt looks oh stop ! you need to get laid '' i wanted to scream brennan at least in this debut novel is extremely irritating thirdly i have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels the suprise switcheroo '' ending is not suprising but more annoying it is just a cheap way to trick the reader and if i have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the killer '' i will scream its pathetic how many times does it need to be written its ridiculous now 'deja dead ' is the first of reichs ' books that i 've read i 've heard that the following books in the brennan series are better and i certainly hope this is the case i really did n't like the book not the characters the plot the writing but i will give reichs another try and read the next book in the series if its as bad as 'deja dead ' i do n't think i ever read another one her books
looks like hewitt got the color wrong his prescription is relegating the repubican party to the areas of only of the former confederacy and even that part is shrinking
six years and thousands of us deaths tens of thousands permanently disabled hundreds of thousands of iraqis dead countless rethuglican investigations indictments convictions guilty pleas pedophelia bribery blackmail and election tampering mission accomplished 14 reviews and the book knocked down to 2.99 impressive hope hewitt did n't get a large advance for this dismal publishing failure
no greater writing has been offered by a great conservative thinker since the bible so great is this masterpiece that amazon has reduced it to the low low price of 2.99 just to make sure everybody has a chance to read it ! obviously hugh hewitt gets it that to ensure the future of america we must hand over more control to republicans only by lining their own pockets with bribes giving perky contracts and earmarks to their friends shifting the tax burden from those who inherit their wealth to those who work for a living can we insure that hugh hewitt will write more books !
from the land of written in a didactic approach like a good professsor should comes this years winner for economic creativity full of theorum statistics abstraction complexities cute little pictures and sometimes difficult to grasp this book has some interesting and refreshing perspectives including how certain natural behaviors parallel the same behaviors found in investing that said i feel some of this stuff is just intellectual ramblings with not much real basis for pragmatist investors i can see the quoting this stuff at the company xmas party the author quotes warren buffett 's people make simple things difficult '' philosophy yet writes a book that goes out of it 's way to make simple things difficult '' although the book provides a different angle to view investing from i did not walk away from this book feeling that i gained any newly found insight about investing to save the reader time and money and not to oversimplify the basic investing premise i obtained from this book is investing is like gambling win some you lose some '' and to minimize risk one should just buy and hold solid investments '' and ultimately let time be your best friend
the is by far the weakest grisham novel i 've ever read the first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist joel backman more about him later wanders italy for nearly 200 pages learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with italian carictatures that would make chico marx cringe when grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense it 's all for naught as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending as for joel backman i ca n't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory a disgraced lawyer lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power all the while causing numerous deaths and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion you read the book and
definitely not one of his best ! slow slow slow but at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language unlike the hero of the partner '' who learned a little known spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks
grisham is one of my favorite authors however this one is not one of his bests ! we all understood that he loved bologna and the culture of italy it is a nice written travelogue but this is not what i want to get from a grisham novel what about the pace the adventure the and talking about the end could it be more simple those who are familiar with bologna or the italian culture or those willing to visit italy you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel try something else
first let me say this was my first exposure to jodi picoult so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent i ca n't comment beyond this book that said this was one of the few novels '' i was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through in addition to another reviewer 's comments on shifting pov for what reason i could n't come to terms with it unrealistic characters and scenes it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages pop lit '' came to mind immediately and while i tried to finish this book loaned by a friend i found it an irritating endeavor despite some popularity i 'm not likely to pick up another picoult book
