mccarthy 's writing and portrayal of lester ballard a necrophiliac is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape and then you have to wonder why am i siding with a necrophiliac of all people the writing is up to the high standards expected of mccarthy and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche the book has an interesting twist to the plot ballard is falsely accused of rape his house is auctioned off and he 's left as a social outcast an animal he is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal if you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read
i was initiated into the world of cormac mccarthy with this novel in southern lit class my professor was the vice president of the cormac mccarthy appreciation society and considers mccarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century as do this work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of faulkner it incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point there is a message about decay especially of the south in the diction especially where the flood and the degeneration of lester ballard are concerned there is old south new south and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of ballard there is also lust here something that faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than mccarthy in the sound and the fury and as i lay dying however mccarthy 's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor mccarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about the ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well is the most unique of gifts this novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart but it is well worth the read it is haunting to the reader not for its perverse subject matter but for its understated messages masterfully placed in the character of lester ballard a disposessed and depraved madman holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to
i can not speak to the literary points in the novel though i can say i enjoyed it in fact i could n't put it down until i finished it however i think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of sevierville tennessee ! strangely the author refers accurately to several persons and events that i 've known forever wade 's children still live in sevierville so do the whaley and ogle families the 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the white caps were stopped by a real life clint eastwood of a sevier county sheriff ! the opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than mccarter whose trademark saying was we sell the earth '' my grandfather has never told me of any with lester ballard the novels main character ! thank goodness ! as it turns out ballard is a murdering necrophiliac this is where mccarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community
there is no denying the strain of faulkner that runs through mccarthy 's early works like his predecessor mccarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place here the hills of eastern tennessee interact but mccarthy is more fun to read his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind 's eye he does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly often ungodly forms child of god '' is for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful elegant prose but that is one of the great joys of cormac mccarthy 's early novels they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of beautifully painted landscape and haunting nightmarish imagery
i have read sevral of mccarthy 's other novels his best ones stretch something to the limit in blood meridian it was violence here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings lester ballard is the ultimate user other people exist for him only to meet his needs even if they are dead i have never before read a book about necrophilia and yes as many of the other reviewers point out reading this book takes a strong stomach yet mccarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic totally in spite of myself i found myself cheering ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away the only thing i can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester yet i believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book i do n't think the title is meant to be ironic i think we are meant to see that even lester ballard really is a child of god
this is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world lester ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the eastern tennessee countryside he 's accused of rape imprisoned for a short time then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man it 's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it 's obvious from the start this man is troubled this is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness i found the chapter where the town sheriff deputy and old wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting a recommended book but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs
the protector 's war 2005 is the second alternate history novel in the change series following dies the fire in the previous volume the bearkillers allied with the mackenzie clan cora central oregon ranchers ' association and the university committee they cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along highway 20 at the echo creek bridge using larson 's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction then they attacked the western fort from the sky with in this novel during the eighth year after the change alleyne loring and john hordle break into woburn abbey to free nigel and maude loring the special icelander detachment guards are bypassed distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the lorings nigel and maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons when the blocked door is noticed nigel and maude respond with knife and club as the sid guards attempt to force the door they gain some time but eventually the guards get into the room nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers when hordle enters the room the guards retreat down the hallway nigel has minor wounds but maude has been cut through the abdomen she bleeds out as her husband holds her at the urgings of the rescuers nigel lays maude 's body on the sofa and flees out the window the sid guards do n't pursue them but other troops are searching the countryside at larsdalen on the ninth anniversary of the change mike havel lord bear concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder as it burns instead of flaring the audience cheers moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the change the party or wake continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the lord ken mike 's shows his latest attempts to understand the change the ideal gas law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure still reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the change it looks like the alien space bat theory is correct someone or something has imposed the change upon them in mcminnville the protector is building another fort this one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel and concrete still the protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack this story is despite the name the prelude to the protector 's war both sides are preparing for the war but not eager to start it right away the protectorate is stronger but the alliance is growing faster of course the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy concerns diverse opinions and sheer indecisiveness all this hampers their preparations but few really doubt that the protectorate will try to conquer the williamette valley and beyond btw do you reckon that the date of the change march is symbolic it is saint patrick 's day and juney 's mother was irish but what could it mean highly recommended for stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue military training and actions and perseverance jordi
yet another fine effort from stirling the finely developed plot the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again a proven master of the genre his characters continue to be excellent deep and detailed the plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels i found the title a bit misleading however given the way the plot develops no spoilers so i wo n't elaborate other than to suggest gathers the storm '' or somthing similar might have ben a better title hopefully a meeting at corvallis '' will be equally entertaining
stirling has succeded again protector 's war is an amazing addition to the change trilogy and well worth the read honestly i do n't know where to start when explaining how good it is so i will let you know the one thing i found highly disappointing about it in one word wicca that 's right sterling has filled this book with so much blessed be 's '' and lord and lady '' junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story in fact if it were n't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross i 'd have given this book two maybe three stars somehow i highly doubt that wicca would ever ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as sterling protrays here likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again in europe and the western hemisphere in africa in asia etc but sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced but one where the lord and lady '' actually interact with some of the characters yet the characters do n't sit there and think to themselves hey my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful and they actually exist maybe they are responsible for what happened ! '' nope never crosses the mackenzies mind oh well my only advise to stirling would be keep up the great stories but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum we do n't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light and i 'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions but let 's try to keep to a minimum the blessed be 's '' or lord and lady '' references to a religion a lot of your readers may find well offensive kay
read this book ! i never thought a history book would be one i could not put down it 's enlightening and it 's a broad fascinating history
many reviewers have commented that taylor 's american colonies '' gives indigenous peoples a larger role in north american history than most previous studies do this perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the american revolution among the revolution 's motives were liberty '' a better form of government than that provided by london and empire '' eliminating british barriers to the colonies ' territorial expansion since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists ' territorial expansion giving them a larger role in the history as taylor does makes the history read more in the imperial '' vein see chapter 18 imperial wars and crisis '' in an important way the liberty '' and empire '' motives both came down to land the colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples jefferson summed up their objective as an empire of liberty '' which taylor uses as chapter 18 's final section heading
the reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book it makes for hard going however the insights into the true american history are many the threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools yet the main disappointment other than the fact many have complained about ie the death of kamehameha is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway roxie yonkey also noted this is one of those times when i wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend
has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative text by a good historian that is unless your car wo n't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following monday two days before christmas in that scenario his flies out the window and you just hate his guts taylor not all of us come from big money ! sorry my model car exploded and inconvenienced you so ! thanks for ruining my gpa ! good book though
i found this book well researched and full of information i knew nothing about taylor does n't pull any punches when discussing our european ancestors and their brutality towards the native americans they helped destroy fascinating reading for anyone interested in our early history
we all learned the basics of colonial history in school the mayflower jamestown tobacco the development of new amsterdam boston charleston philadelphia indentured servants and french trappers spanish conquistadores however most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760. moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and indians despite being an american history buff it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that i realized how little i knew taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the spanish french english swedish dutch german etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the united states there are plenty of fascinating details about exploration the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies more importantly this book provides a solid background for why the colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period a and book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about this is history that is hard to put down
traditionally coverage of colonial america '' is confined to the study of the thirteen english colonies of the eastern seaboard a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of european involvement in north america to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before christopher columbus 's historic voyage alan taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book a survey of the first three centuries of the european presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants his scope is impressive after an initial chapter that provides a year overview of the population migration that settled the continent taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the european colonies in the region the canvas is immense encompassing the spanish settlements of the southwest the exploration of canada and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the west indies as well as the colonization of the atlantic seaboard by nearly a european countries through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population as well as the relations with europe and africa taylor 's approach does not exclude the details of settlement though throughout the book the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions detailing the choices they made the factors that went into them and how these choices shaped subsequent development the result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together though not necessarily within these pages into the united states of today as the first book in the penguin history of the united states '' taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes by blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a account he has produced a superb history of america 's colonial development one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come
books like this are regrettably but understandably rare alan taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in north america up to the turn of the nineteenth century from the earliest migrations across beringia to the european impact on hawaii it is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single compact volume while somewhat slanted toward an account after the sixteenth century for instance the chapter on the west indies from is almost entirely about the british presence hispaniola and cuba are completely ignored it is only a moderate bias admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the french in canada and louisiana the spanish in the southwest and california and russians in the northwest and alaska the tone of the writing however is exquisitely balanced and clean in fact the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era american historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research critical analysis and sound yet astonishing interpretation taylor 's bibliography is a treasure chest of books i ca n't wait to read he expertly weaves the most recent foci of american historiography atlantic studies epidemiology environmental history and archaeology analyses of trade demographics gender roles race into the more familiar stories of explorers empires wars and migration the whole story or galaxy of stories is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context perfect for the beginning pupil this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most student of american history it is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done
taylor provides an extensive 526 pages including bibliography and index overview of european colonial initiatives in the atlantic north america and parts of the caribbean from the early when portuguese and spanish got their feet wet so to speak by colonizing the azores canaries and medeiras through spanish and russian efforts on the west coast in the early substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the french dutch and spanish as well as english settlement in the eastern caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the united states a tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between europeans and native americans that decimated the latter primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare slavery appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the indians relied taylor also describes how the indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from european traders and colonists when they perceived often erroneously that the europeans ' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests and yes the indians traded in slaves either other indians or africans as well the role and some of the impact of enslaved africans on colonial development is also described throughout the book regarding the english colonies that became the original thirteen united states it 's helpful for taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the american revolution for example south carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of barbados and initiated use of enslaved africans on a scale that dwarfed the chesapeake tobacco plantations and pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial english quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious german family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves i recommend this book to anyone with an interest in settlement the formative history of the united states and the interaction of europeans with native americans
the above is my favorite book and slb conjured up similar emotions in me i read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter 's must read '' pile when she is ready for it this is one of those books that when you read it it forever changes your life atleast it did for me the same way tkam changed me and has stayed with me i highly recommend this book
the story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy i liked very much how softly the author gives us the readers so much information on the lives of bees and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested although i do not consider it a masterpiece it is very very likable
i read this book 2 years ago and i must say that it is one of my favorite books the imagry that kidd uses is amazing i could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia you fall right in love with the charicters this book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged and in love it is such a dynamic story with suspense i felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book and i wish there were a sequal i would reccomend this book to anyone
a wonderful gentle informative coming of age story and the reader was a pleasure to listen to
this book really great i enjoyed the story immensley character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized i really could picture myself at the flamingo pink '' house in tiburon the main character lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother the group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life love faith and understanding it 's very heartfelt
one of the best books ever ! ! ! ! i was disappointed that the story was n't longer as i was so sorry when it was over i even contemplated rereading it immediately but decided to try another sue monk kidd novel instead and read the mermaid chair different genre but also very entertaining ! i have become an overnight true fan of this author
lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south her mother was shot unclear by who but lilly feels responsible in infancy and she has been raised by her mean hateful father who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits among other tortures lilly 's only friend is the african american rosaleen when rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character and she and lily end up in jail lilly is bailed out by her father but she escapes and then breaks rosaleen out of the hospital she was beaten half to death by the police after lilly was bailed out on the lam lilly decides to try and find out about her mother she and rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of black sisters who survive making the best honey in the county of course ultimately their summer of freedom ends and reality comes crashing back in when lilly is found by her father while the story is somewhat predictable kidd keeps the tension moves the plot forward and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters while the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot it is with a few obvious exceptions the subtext and not the foreground this allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside a very good read
the era and the setting of the novel was something i could relate to growing up in the 60 's and 70 's and knew it was a tumultuous time the book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the south during the civil rights era it was wonderfully told and beautifully written
over the years i have read many books on the red scare in hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism this book does the best job of describing the issues the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films in reading many past books the authors never quite expressed why they were communists in fact many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party this book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than dalton trumbo one of the leading communists in hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist and in the end he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings but this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as republicans while i am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left i find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias the significance of this book to me from reading ring lardner 's famous i 'd hate myself in the morning '' to watching woody allen 's the front '' and finally getting a closing answer is overwhelming i no longer feel the need to explore why americans chose to follow another government 's agenda to the potential detriment of our country however i do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly i do n't view communism as wrong it 's just a different government method some choose for myself i remain quite satisfied with democracy even in these trying times rather the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism i can live with that reasoning this is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the movies or communism in closing i must comment on the complete disrespect shown to elia kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when nick nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award i suggest they read this book the red scare was a horrible period but freedom of speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own i strongly recommend this book
while george clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his community '' are proudly out of touch with mainstream america i was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by ronald and allis radosh for readers with an interest in the context of the between the hollywood elite '' and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and dvds this book is an excellent resource i say the context '' of the clash because this is a look at history and a serious research work too this is not a book that details the fashionable leftist obsessions of clooney streisand penn and the rest and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly instead red star over hollywood '' digs deep into something far more serious and sinister sinister '' comes from the latin word for left '' by the way the film colony 's infiltration by agents of the comintern dedicated partisans of stalin and other actors directors writers and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the united states as clooney 's speech and even more so his movie make clear modern hollywood 's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against mccarthyism '' and the blacklist that 's what makes clooney 's so laughable does anyone in hollywood mccarthy but the radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence in other words the turned up real witches but that there was also a strong and active left in hollywood even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in hollywood it was this left that was in the most direct conflict with the stalinists their apologists and their dupes particularly before and during world war ii all of this is important information but it 's when they turn to their discussion of huac and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront hollywood 's defining myth far from the usual analysis of the deranged and sweaty mccarthy and why do so few people seem to notice that joe mccarthy had nothing to do with the committee on activities the authors have gone in committee records and also into the backgrounds of the people from hollywood who came before the committee it 's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of mccarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents ronald and allis radosh are to be commended for doing the latter it 's because this book is so heavily researched so filled with names dates and places that i note again that it may not be to everyone 's taste it is i repeat a work of history it notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of say an ann coulter book and so does n't have the excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works but those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists this on the other hand is a book that deserves to be around for a long long time
remember the hollywood blacklist the hollywood ten i 'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you were n't alive in the that 's because tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive it was the era of the red scare of senator joseph mccarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in west virginia it was the time of congressional investigations a time when invoking the fifth amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye for a select few the mccarthy era was a time of great fear and no one feared this against communism more than hollywood why because despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years the movie industry oozed communists there were so many reds in hollywood that they should have renamed the town little moscow yet even today you wo n't hear about this truth in the media you will however get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of ronald radosh 's red star over hollywood the film colony 's long romance with the left '' talk about exploding myths ! radosh 's book which he with his wife allis cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real hollywood of the and vladimir lenin the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of marxism to the soviet union back in the early part of the twentieth century had a soft spot for film and theater he believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays this is exactly what the kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades they managed to gain converts to their cause men who later became movers and shakers like budd schulberg joseph losey and maurice rapf by allowing them to work closely with the soviet film industry once these people came back to the united states they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks willi munzenberg jerome and john howard lawson in no time at all writes radosh a branch of the communist party flourished in hollywood so many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry in an attempt to make contacts and find work had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves the hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways one of the most successful methods involved the tried and true united frontism '' and popular front '' techniques or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of national socialist germany in the helped increase membership although the party 's propensity to change direction oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the kremlin tended to alienate many members also off putting was the discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time albert maltz for example discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed revisionist '' by the upper hierarchy his very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the tactics used behind the scenes despite the ugliness the hollywood reds occasionally displayed they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like mission to moscow '' the spanish earth '' and the north star '' congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer and silenced a few more but many never repudiated their warped views i enjoyed radosh 's book the first one of his i 've had the chance to read the author and his spouse obviously know what they 're talking about and since ronald radosh himself was a communist for many years he understands how these groups think and act red star over hollywood '' occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes for instance the part where we learn about ronald reagan at the time a liberal and his buddy william holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes god bless him ! the account of albert maltz 's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism arguably the best part of the book however involves the long strange trip writer dalton trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life so many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat i have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book in the case of the former if you 're not very familiar with this time period read a background history of the red scare first doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist in the case of the latter the topic is so huge that radosh does n't have the space to cover many of the important reds there is almost nothing here about lillian hellman or dashiell hammett for example and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books nevertheless this book is well worth your time read it and remember it the next time hollywood releases yet another we were innocent '' propaganda piece
i have always been curious about the influence of communism in hollywood this book by the radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it it was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated it seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation i came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful the studio heads whether for economic or patriotic reasons insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions like c coffman who wrote the prior review i wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the soviet union it was difficult for me to comprehend how the hollywood writers continued to support the soviet union in the face of clear evidence that soviet movie writers were being executed in the soviet union nor could i fully understand how these hollywood writers men mostly of immense talent cowered before their communist censors finally the radoshes put the hollywood ten '' and the blacklist years in perspective they state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the congressional investigations were highly exaggerated i came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost it would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a communist take over of the usa come true since like their fellow professionals in the soviet union they would have probably been executed who said you ca n't win for losing !
this book touches on one of the touchiest and controversies of the last sixty years precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of one needs to zero in from two angles here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda but despite an obvious bias built in to the account the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know but might not after the shouting matches over mccarthyism i really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business but you can read around the lurid conservative passages not so bad for some useful corrections of the record and no doubt much left out
it 's no secret that many of hollywood 's and the entertainment businesss 's current stars '' are socialist afficienados or worse but where did this denationalized elitism come from red star over hollywood '' does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the hollywood political left communists and fellow travelers from the 1930 's to 1950 's with about 37 pages of reference material diaries speeches congressional testimony biographies autobiographies news articles interviews etc the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the soviet union in its attempts to take over '' hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a soviet america the names of the actors screen writers producers etc who were card carrying communists fellow travelers quislings leftists and varieties of socialists who made up the hollywood scene in those days will floor you you 'll have to read the book to find out who they were and there were many heroes as well who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs you 'll never watch movies on the turner classic movies channel the same way again after you read the book look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films the authors draw some connections between the hollywood leftists of that era and the current crop of leftists in the entertainment industry '' today but that comes at the end of the book and is a very brief section this is a must read book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the hollywood of the 's and who here 's the sophist leftist pontifications of the tim robbins barbra streisands bill mahrs and others one thing that will strike you is how well educated thoughful well read and articulate both the left and the right were in the 1930 's 1940 's and 1950 's there was intelligent discourse on all sides they make today 's left and right apologists seem like graders reciting dick and jane '' from memory that insight was worth the price of the book gar
i used to wonder why hollywood ignored the crimes of soviet communism which easily rival the crimes of national socialism something they 've shown us over and over and over again certainly understandable not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during lenin 's red terror '' the deaths of millions during forced collectivization the torture and mass murder during stalin 's purges of the late 30 's the massacre of thousands of polish citizens at katyn or the horrors of the gulag but hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on mccarthyism '' and the ghastly blacklist '' they 're listed in this book guilty by suspicion the front the way we were the majestic marathon man the house on carroll street fellow traveler one of hollywood ten this is all propaganda of course the way they tell it you 'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history mccarthy and his ilk were no saints and there were certainly excesses but i do n't believe anyone was murdered by mccarthy and huac by contrast tens of millions were murdered in soviet russia apparently that 's no big deal to the fools in tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over mccarthyism '' the blacklist and the persecuted hollywood ten these crybabies would n't have lasted one day in the kolyma camps ! the radoshes show us that hollywood back in the 30 's and 40 's was filled with communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing stalin 's mass murders such as the north star song of russia and mission to moscow while the first two simply glossed over the stalinist holocaust in ukraine the latter film actually glorified stalin 's secret police and mass purges can you believe this hollywood actually justified stalin 's killing machine ! think about that the next time some hollywood leftist whines about the horrors '' of mccarthyism '' while no one in hollywood would dare praise stalin now quite a few do embrace other communist despots for example shirley maclaine made a pilgrimage to red china then reeling in the aftermath of chairman mao 's cultural revolution and declared that mao was a hero of all time someone should let shirley know that her hero '' is the biggest mass murderer in history see mao the unknown story '' by jung chang and jon halliday and countless hollywood useful idiots '' such as robert redford danny glover oliver stone and many many others swoon over that thug fidel castro who has more blood on his hands killed than the hated augusto pinochet killed pinochet 's crimes have been the subject of several hollywood flicks missing of love and shadows etc none have been made on the mass murders of castro and mao to add insult to injury castroite robert redford was executive producer of the motorcycle diaries '' a saintly portrayal of castro 's chief executioner ernesto che '' guevara in his early days he later went on to murder hundreds of '' at la cabana prison something that 's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next film starring benicio del toro the negative reviews are beyond pathetic mccarthy this mccarthy that blah blah blah of course they ca n't refute one thing in the book they prefer myth not facts hollywood was filled with reds now pinkos the rosenberg 's were guilty as charged and alger hiss was a soviet spy truth hurts deal with it ! also recommended fidel hollywood 's favorite tyrant by humberto fontova hollywood party how communism seduced the american film industry in the and by kenneth lloyd billingsley in denial historians communism espionage by john earl haynes harvey klehr the venona secrets exposing soviet espionage and america 's traitors by herbert romerstein and eric breindel
the mccarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in american history and those who faced blacklisting in hollywood have been lauded as heroes through new research and the reliance on original source materials the radoshes have compiled a thorough of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the communist party and their betrayal by that very same party the radoshes describe the infatuation of the hollywood party '' from its roots in the when several visited the soviet union they demonstrate that far from being innocent the hollywood ten '' were committed communists who used and abused supporters like humphrey bogart and lauren bacall for their own ends the communist party in turn cynically used the ten '' for its own ends trotting them out to speak at unrelated events for years which prevented the ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work the authors also describe the way the cp line was inserted in several films most notoriously mission to moscow '' this film designed to turn the views of a skeptical american public toward the ussr during world war ii whitewashes stalin 's purge trials of the where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the party and either named names '' or walked a fine line to avoid naming names for many being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine communist infiltration if i have any criticisms of the book it is that the radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony 's long romance with the left through the vietnam war years and today while the blacklist years were seminal many in hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the ussr and take almost reflexively positions today we are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book in the meantime red star over hollywood '' is well worth reading
the back lash continues against the media on revisionist history how many times have you watched a documentary or a movie that exhonerates those poor persecuted innocents dubbed the hollywood ten as sitting targets seated before an array of mean and ruthless zealots the huac committee of the late 1940 's and early 50 's over and over and over it seems does n't it well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder red star over hollywood '' which tells the real tale that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party usa who took their marching orders directly from the kremlin they were stalin 's men and not to put to fine a point on it useful idiots in his quest to foment a communist revolution ron radosh a communist from childhood smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the rosenberg 's only to find that they were guilty ! after he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the leftist corp '' and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades friends they radosh is a phd in history and a diligent detailed researcher of the facts he 's interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go unfortunately one does n't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians archeologists political scientists reporters book publishers or video media types as an aside i found it interesting to compare this book with neil gabler 's an empire of their own how the jew 's invented hollywood '' the nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a communistic revolution is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism i do n't know but i for one would encourage radosh to address the subject and he 's the man to do it another book to read as a companion peace would be intellectuals '' by paul johnson the author of modern times '' it 's important to recognize that not all of those in hollywood whose lives were ruined by huac were communists some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices to the readers benefit radosh teases out these nuances rather well and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest setting the record straight is important but the hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a fable of innocence destroyed by malice '' it 's their shakey attempt at moral authority the kind that underpins a sean penn in his critique of bush 's iraq policy while he ignores the evils of sadaam hussein this book challenges the template of the hollywood left that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against bullies leading a witch hunt against activities '' that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers read it it 's good

because i do n't get tv one and have only seen the show a few times i was pleasantly suprised when i saw this cookbook today in the store i recommend it a million times over instead of mo'nique 's especially since she got some of her recipes from him ! ! ! a great way to get a taste of what 's in store for you if you buy this book is to to go the show 's website many recipes are there but nothing beats having a book that you can carry with you some of these will be making their debut at the thanksgiving table next week and i ca n't wait ! there are some beautiful photos but not a whole lot but that does n't take away from the book too much because you can view many of them on the site highly recommended i wan na have backbreaking sex with garvin thanks for letting me share
my husband and i have been waiting for this book since we first saw garvin on tvone needless to say i am pleased with this book the layout and directions are clear and concise the entire book is not in color but i can deal with that here 's the table of contents simple style fresh food made at home a great dish sticks and steaks with g thoughts my one criticism is that i wish a hardback edition of this book was available

the story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy i liked very much how softly the author gives us the readers so much information on the lives of bees and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested although i do not consider it a masterpiece it is very very likable
i read this book 2 years ago and i must say that it is one of my favorite books the imagry that kidd uses is amazing i could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia you fall right in love with the charicters this book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged and in love it is such a dynamic story with suspense i felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book and i wish there were a sequal i would reccomend this book to anyone
a wonderful gentle informative coming of age story and the reader was a pleasure to listen to
this book really great i enjoyed the story immensley character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized i really could picture myself at the flamingo pink '' house in tiburon the main character lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother the group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life love faith and understanding it 's very heartfelt
one of the best books ever ! ! ! ! i was disappointed that the story was n't longer as i was so sorry when it was over i even contemplated rereading it immediately but decided to try another sue monk kidd novel instead and read the mermaid chair different genre but also very entertaining ! i have become an overnight true fan of this author
lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south her mother was shot unclear by who but lilly feels responsible in infancy and she has been raised by her mean hateful father who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits among other tortures lilly 's only friend is the african american rosaleen when rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character and she and lily end up in jail lilly is bailed out by her father but she escapes and then breaks rosaleen out of the hospital she was beaten half to death by the police after lilly was bailed out on the lam lilly decides to try and find out about her mother she and rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of black sisters who survive making the best honey in the county of course ultimately their summer of freedom ends and reality comes crashing back in when lilly is found by her father while the story is somewhat predictable kidd keeps the tension moves the plot forward and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters while the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot it is with a few obvious exceptions the subtext and not the foreground this allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside a very good read
the era and the setting of the novel was something i could relate to growing up in the 60 's and 70 's and knew it was a tumultuous time the book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the south during the civil rights era it was wonderfully told and beautifully written
the messenger by daniel silva is just as interesting exciting and intriguing as every other gabriel allon book has been i was hooked on page one and had a hard time putting it down until i reached the last page my only regret is that more of the story is not set in venice my favorite city there is just enough of a parallel to characters and events in the real world to make the stories plausible and just enough romance and action to make it gripping and absorbing i am already looking forward to the next gabriel allon story
well imho not as great as the other books in the allon series but well worth the read ! i 'm looking forward to the next in the series
very pleased with the price and speedy delievery and quality of the product
in this novel we have the characters we have come to love the writing is tighter and the plot clear not quite as exciting or fresh some further development with leah happens which i wo n't reveal
a caveat to all westerners who may think our most sacrosanct values are protected silva reaches into inner space to warn us of the dedicated nature of the enemy if this is fiction it is well dressed as a call to its readers
daniel silva has taken his protaganist right onto the front pages of the worlds ' newspapers with his best work to date
this is a timely well written and exciting book i enjoyed reading it
love silva 's characters and plots only wish is for more more more
i think this is a brilliant book a great selection of interesting and relevant ideas on art politics and technology beautiful images too and well published
this book is a gift for readers maybe not all readers but those who are genuinely interested in human values and culture bruners ideas are bright and deep making us understand that the future of education depends on human beings as agents of their destiny the importance of every cultures history and the transmission of experiences is only possible through human interactions we can not be naive and think that technology is not an instrument of culture it is and we must acknowledge it otherwise we will be overridden by it but education is only possible by means of intersubjective exchanges they are the key to the development of human beings
i do n't know about you but sometimes i stumble upon a book that is a salve to my soul i am not happy about one thing or another and i need someone to talk to talk at or listen to i need to look into someone else 's life so that i can feel human again and not totally strange and alone nora ephron 's heartburn did that for me and for that i will put it on my bookshelf along with the many books that have served the same purpose on my second reading i could not remember if the story was based on the author 's life i was afraid that i might not enjoy it if it was pure fiction i was wrong the book is a very very funny satire of the washington scene whch has not changed it is also a tale of real angst and heartbreak what is basically a sad story has delicious veins of humor wistfulness sadness prosaic pragmatism and real recipes marbling through it all of which magically meld into a satisfying whole but that is what a work of art can do
every year or so i heartburn '' one of my favorite novels of all time it is and possibly the best and most memorable form of revenge that a spurned wife ever had today 's of heartburn '' was inspired by the revelation that mark felt is the real name of deep throat the former fbi mole who fed watergate information to ephron 's former husband carl bernstein in this roman a clef the chatacter based on bernstein is called mark feldman '' today i read ephron 's admission in the huffington post blog that living with the knowledge of deep throat 's true identity was a very heavy burden '' so was her estranged husband 's character name inspired consciously by deep throat 's name or subconsciously i do n't really need an answer to that question however it does prove that the novels we love are gifts that keep on giving thanks nora thanks felt for everything
if i had it to do over again i would have made a different kind of pie the pie i threw at mark made a terrific mess but a blueberry pie would have been even better since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer rachel samstat muses on her marriage to mark feldman nora ephron 's thinly disguised account of her marriage to famed watergate journalist carl bernstein is funny in parts though if you 're looking for advice on how to save your marriage the aforementioned tidbit is typical of the advice you 'll get rachel is seven months pregnant with her second child when she learns her husband is not only having an affair with a mutual acquaintance but has fallen in love with her this indignity is compounded because due to rachel 's advanced preganancy she ca n't even date she does manage one innocent flirtation on the subway which in true slapstick fashion leads to armed robbery ah the perils of life flitting between new york and washington short and savvy this contemporary 80 's novel is peppered with recipes since rachel is a cookbook editor and host of her own cooking show a collapsing marriage does n't seem suitable for comedy but nora ephron makes it work and will have you laughing all the way to the bitter end
this book took a little getting used to this was my first of reading books with recipes within the storylines but once i did boy did i laugh ! great story along with recipes who could n't beat a book that was funny witty and full of recipes ! ! a great read for anyone whom wants to curl up with a good book
nora crafted one of my favorite books why i picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me why i finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery why i 've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat sadness steeped in life 's tea in real life i 've played the part of the toddler in this tale wish i could say my folks were class acts such as the author and her former spouse but chicken fried steak is more common in middle america than lillian hellman 's pot roast
this is one of contemporary fictions first books it was written in the early eighties before bridget jones became a household name it is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage it is a quick read but its not an premise i recommend it for the beach or the bathtub
now that our democratic system has been eroded almost to the point of no repair perhaps we should read books like this one to refresh our minds about what this country has always stood for
i am unfortunately not suprised by any of the revelations in this book it seems that the vast majority of americans simply do not care what kind of scumbags claim to represent '' us unfortunately i do not own a multibillion dollar corporation so i suppose i do not deserve representation hey did n't the declaration of independence say something about people not being represented properly oh pardon me i have mentioned america 's true patriotic roots god forbid anyone not agree with dick bush 's or is that conservative it 's hard to tell version of patriotism anyhow i 'll save a seat for you other treasonous free thinkers in the prison camp or hell we all know that those are the only two suitable places for those who do not agree with the decider ''
this book is a terrific volume for understanding what 's gone wrong in america over the past 30 years unlike many authors who spout only uninformed opinions and vitriolic ones at that this guy actually does substantive research on his issues and helps us understand the deeper context behind them the history the players their connections to other folks what good is that you 'll learn how much of our world is being by people and regulations that you 've never even hear of or about if everyone read this book and spoke up we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives we 'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this
actually you ca n't according to greg palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges jeb bush with instituting his own style of jim crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected it 's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that bush would have won anyway palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up but palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote and the votes that were not counted he charges that more than citizens were improperly labeled as felons and were kept from voting in florida these were almost all who universally vote democrat there was an 80 criteria for finding a match of felon names the company choice point started with a 90 match but the state told them that was too high ! they were told to make it an 80 match so a felon named john johnson would also keep a citizen named jack johnson or john johnson from voting too when did the state of florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote they did n't even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected the company that got the job of putting the fix in choice point was awarded a dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter florida decided to pay much more per voter with choice point now here 's the lie choice point said that they did not use race as a criterion but it was used as a matching criterion presto ! even with the disproportionate number of blacks in the prison population palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons just to ensure the outcome the voting machines in black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in white neighborhoods in some cases 18 of the black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in white neighborhoods were 1 to 2 was the norm this was the perfect scam since anyone knows that blacks would overwhelmingly vote for gore and the whites would have had a large voting block for bush florida 's official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting they did n't want any felons to try to vote palast asks what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it good point ! not one person in florida was arrested for voting twice then there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process palast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged when he offered the story to cbs a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias they refused why the cbs executive called the state of florida to verify the story they the state assured them there was nothing to it is n't that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse palast gained a large audience in europe bringing this story to light it received almost no attention here and when it did it was way after the election this was the most important part of the book for me while i enjoyed his commentary on wackenhut and other exposes this one was the most riveting it scares me this is n't supposed to happen in the us that is why i recommend this book and especially his newer one armed madhouse '' palast proves by showing leaked documents pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing i thought this was only supposed to happen in a third world nation should n't someone go to jail for this should n't we be able to count on it
i read this book in record time greg palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government ' i am ashamed that our own us media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government from iran to iran contra to iraq and the oil fields from the halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of all the people and how important freedom of the press and the fourth estate is to your democracy
palast bares it all put me through all 5 stages of from disbelief to anger to despair
greg palast loves and sarcastic now you can understand why emergent countries will always remain in the third world for the benefit of big corporations and corruptous politicians not surprising that all the info provided by palast was never shown on the america 's news
the first time i read this book it was because i 'd heard an interview with the author on npr and felt compelled to get the whole story it 's a fast entertaining and scary read do n't skip any parts if you can help it it 's not just about corporate and political corruption it details with evidence how this world of ours works and what we need to keep our eyes open for when the bad guys get into our neighborhoods the sections on what us corporations do in other countries is appalling the sections on the terms of imf and world bank loans is horrifying and if you 've ever wondered what the heck public utility privatization is all about this explains it and it 's ugly
devour this book in small bites or you 're likely to choke on the raw truth of it between these covers palast demonstrates repeatedly why everyone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts while i 'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations the policies and actions carried out by the bush administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of palast 's claims in broad daylight if only the mainstream media were paying attention then again the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers viewers listeners so why should we expect otherwise occasionally palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually know the motivations and responsibilities blame of various people he is writing about here more often than not however he simply puts forth so many facts and connects so many dots for us that it 's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has and again the actions of the bush administration and various members and associates of the bush family have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years read this book and compare it with news stories from the past years and if you have done any digging at all you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be hopefully you 'll also see how important it is now to stand up speak out and fight for genuine middle class america and those folks even less fortunate than us one thing you can put money on our current government sure is n't looking out for them or you good luck to us all
how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told this book was a read for me not because i could n't put it down but because i felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing i ca n't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and i frequently felt sick reading it but truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it i 'm glad i did i was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive which was no easy feat
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
lula cruz and her best gay friend jeff embark on a trip to miami just before college eats her time up after a series of misfortune they find themselves working for a somewhat latin woman cece in a cuban cafe sobe 's south beach environment was n't the only one that caught her attention guy named enrique a man who you could never go wrong swooned her heart but what if enrique turns out to be her best competition later on the first time i read the book i got hooked with it when i finished reading it the book left me amused and it somehow satisfied me what i did n't like in the book was its too predictable however because i was hooked in this book the first time i read it it did n't show as for me however though i enjoyed it i wish the authors put some sense of mystery and quality '' in it that keeps the readers guessing until the very end

then you will absolutely fall in love with this book this book is full of images from a wide range of media and artists the short bios on the artists are short but informative and do n't take up much space more room for pictures if you 're something of an artist yourself then you can certainly pull lots of ideas from this book i definitely am glad i bought this book
not only the content is insightful but the design of this book is just wonderful it is a good source of international drawing 's world and a good coffee table book get it now
beautifully bound and a pleasure to hold what a book is all about vs the digital stuff two small niggles the larger drafted works when reduced for the book become virtually unreadible maybe they could have got a page each and second the dust cover while beautiful and reflecting the texture and aesthetics of the book is virtually useless for it 's purpose as it is too easily torn i gave it 5 because i 'm prejudiced
it has many interesting works in the book it is great to have it
this is a book that when you first open it up and flip through a couple of pages you will be saying to yourself that you have to sit down with it for a long considered look myself i just looked at the care that phaidon press took while publishing this from its rough artistic pages to the look at contemporary drawing and knew instantly that this was a survey book that i would be opening time and again for years to come the artists that are covered here are not neccisarily unknown pettibon peyton and other long standing luminaries stand along side scores of other artists that i had never heard of what it is is a survey of conceptualy based drawing that is occuring today be the artist known or obscure if you are into drawing this is a must have book one thing to keep in mind is that the format presented here is pretty much along the lines of vitamin p and the three 'cream ' books i think all four of these ranged from good to great if you disagree with this sentiment you might not like 'vitamin d '
david kennedy 's freedom from fear '' the volume of the oxford history of the united states is a generally exceptionally well researched history covering from the great depression to the end of world war ii in this book kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals i believe most of david kennedy 's interpretations and judgments are well reasoned however i disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 1931 as one of the main causes of the great depression even more so i dissent very strongly with david kennedy 's suggestion the roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with japan by essentially appeasing japanese aggression against china to quote from his book kennedy writes on page 513 why not acquiesce however complainingly in the japanese action in china reopen at least limited trade with japan '' given the fact that japanese aggression and atrocities in china were as bad or worse as germany 's in europe by late 1941 i find kennedy 's opinion morally reprehensible in general this is a very good book covering social economic political and military history of the era however do n't read freedom from fear '' expecting to learn much about cultural history in the united states between the great depression and world war ii
freedom from fear is an exhaustive study of america and its people during two of this country 's most defining periods the great depression and world war ii david kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in american history while the book is geared towards the general reader it does n't lack for analysis which makes this both an accessible and very informative book this period in question covers which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant but in reality was anything but insignificant from the early stages of the depression in the late during the hoover administration to the atomic bombs used against japan in 1945 during the truman presidency which ended the war in the pacific this books covers many important people and events in both the social political and economic realms of american life the depression years are the focus of the first part of the book obviously and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis how the hoover and roosevelt administrations confronted the crisis how the american people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the new deal was both successful and unsuccessful hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation contrary to what many believe hoover was an extremely capable man but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as franklin roosevelt proved during his presidency the new deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the new deal 's objectives it was n't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery only world war ii would bring that about i think i 'm summarizing kennedy 's view on the new deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program there is so much covered that it 's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely the turmoil in europe caused by hitler 's regime the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before pearl harbor and the eventual american intervention and allied efforts to defeat the german and japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding america 's entry and involvement in the second world war from the mobilization of the country 's industrial and supply to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the european and pacific fronts and the people who played such important roles in the conflict the major battles fought the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies the changing nature on the american homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many americans after world war ii are all covered difficult subjects are n't left out either including the internment of the status of african americans during the war years and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides most especially in the pacific theater of the war this book is yet very analytical when it needs to be quite rare maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate which is not unusual when writing history he at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made lost opportunities and the likes and that should be discussed he does disagree with the theory i suppose advocated by some that roosevelt wanted pearl harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues but overall it is i 've studied this period before but i found this book very rewarding in that i also learned quite a bit i knew little or nothing about i would highly recommend this book
despite the newfound popularity of social history and ethnic history and gender history it 's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice survey history of america heavy on political history freedom from fear tells the story of america during the great depression and the second world war it is a survey but it is broad and deep running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years david kennedy 's pulitzer prize winning text is worth every penny given the two broad subjects it 's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections in the first kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the american economy during the hoover years maligned by history hoover could have been a better president than he was but events overwhelmed him even his great success in life prior to winning the white house did not prepare him for the immensity of the task indeed possibly no one could have handled it but roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge not of actually fixing the problems kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of roosevelt 's new deal programs and his performance in such matters in many places roosevelt could have done better perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community more broadly we see the decline in living conditions and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not we see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted we see a country scared and in turmoil unsure of itself and its destiny but though the depression dragged on waxing and waning events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait though america was among the hardest hit of countries it was not the worst behaving on the international scene rumbles of war began in europe and in asia and america stood aside hoping to avoid it all of course this was not to be and with the japanese attack america found itself thrust into total war the economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending the people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle alliances solidified and the enemies were targeted and america joined the war in its own unique way it could never be said that america takes no advantage of its industrial strength while the countries of europe dealt with the situation forced upon them america armed itself and prepped for battle it built its forces it provided machinery and equipment to allies it transformed factories to a war production mode industrial geniuses pumped with cash streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before and newer and better weapons came to be more than in most books kennedy makes it clear that the american effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort when the western front opened it was run with industrial clarity of purpose if there is a dominant theme in freedom from fear it is that america runs on its commerce the business of america really is business with or without government regulation with or without organized labor it is economy that runs kennedy 's america but with such sweeping vision and engaging style the reader could do much worse to learn about america in the interesting times than to read this gripping account
there is much to like in david kennedy 's history of the united states during the and early his book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period his examination of the new deal is both insightful and judicious while his description of america in the second world war is gripping and informative throughout the book kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the american people and their government yet in some respects the volume is something of a disappointment the book is a contribution to the superb oxford history of the united states '' series which has set a high standard with its earlier volumes it is by this measure that kennedy 's book is wanting it is hardly the comprehensive examination of its topic that the earlier volumes were as his focus on politics and economics gives short shrift to american culture and society during the period moreover his prose often seems excessively grandiose efforts to create soaring metaphors often become too labored and fall flat making for a stark contrast with the clear descriptions and analysis they buttress nevertheless kennedy 's achievement with this book is impressive he has provided a account of america 's efforts to deal with some of the greatest challenges that the nation ever faced readers seeking a history of the period would be hard pressed to find a better and more readable book with which to start
with bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the new deal whether you agree with him or not i ca n't think of a better time and reason for reading this remarkable study by david kennedy kennedy debunks much of what the remnants of history have left most of us about herbert hoover i think this was the most surprising part of the book because everything i had read seen or heard up until now left only negative impressions of the man i have a both a new respect for hoover as a man dour though he was and a clearer understanding of why he failed as a politician i also have a fresh reminder of how nothing is really original fdr borrowed much of the new deal from hoover but where hoover could n't make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance fdr was amenable to trying anything including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with federal regulation an of the playing field between business which had corporatized and labor which until fdr had n't the power to do the same and labor to massive government spending although fdr did n't understand keyensian economics he nevertheless proved the theory fdr defined the general welfare '' clause of the constitution and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since and continues to do so today beside the look at the great depression kennedy also provides a survey of wwii debunking many more myths along the way and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in fdr churchill 's unkept promises to stalin about the opening of a second front in europe i consider this a must read '' for anyone who considers interested in american history
this is a very literate and enjoyable history it explains some of the greatest crises of western civilization and parades in all their glory heroes like fdr churchill truman and marshall and it singles out others for less glowing treatment professor kennedy 's survey of the period from 1929 to the end of is in my view the finest of those perilous times naturally the great depression and world war ii are too vast for any one volume and if one has an interest in any specific topic personage or chapter the author has provided an unrivalled bibliography to kick off the quest the professor 's writing is simple and straightforward and he knows how to keep his narrative moving at a good clip this is essential in such a lengthy document all in all i 'd classify it as a tour de force essential reading for those interested in the depression and the war after the wonderfully enjoyable read the book sits well on the shelf and comes down quickly for solid reference this is definitely a five star effort
i thoroughly enjoyed this book the book is exactly what it says it is a general history of the united stated during the depression and wwii i found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote this should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together the book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it after reading it i can see why it won the pulitzer prize
freedom from fear '' by david kennedy is a highly respectable history book for the great depression and wwii era professor kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research as well as his own opinions on the great depression in the beginning of this book kennedy begins with herbert hoover and how he did things wrong '' but then he turned to fdr who kept up with the changing economy at that time kennedy portrays fdr as powerful and willing for change he was an inspiring character for those during the depression further into the book kennedy devotes his research to the new deal and the effects it had on the depression kennedy did go into detail about the effects but he should have researched more about the causes of the depression even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader it was kennedy 's writing style that made the book hard to put down it was very enjoyable to read and we recommend it to any history lovers who want to learn more about the depression
management new paradigms strategy the change leader information challenges knowledge worker productivity managing oneself druker proved himself more than capable in his definitions and unique challenge to managers rather of a retrospective of his past work he set aside to wirte not the known past but the unknown future '' peter drucker discusses the profound social and economic changes occurring today and considers how management not government or free markets should address these new realities in the workplace management is business management in all kind of organizations '' this book is easy to read for most content may be wider than how we think management usually is druker wrote in his introduction the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century '' peter drucker discusses how the new paradigms of management have change and will continue to change our basics assumptions and principles of management
drucker outlines lessons that management can learn from the changing world economy and population 1. management is not just business management but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future like education the professions and healthcare 2. recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise both team '' organization and the ceo cult of personality '' have their shortcomings it can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular ceo 's must have successors you must find the right balance of organization that fits your company 's business needs 3. there is no one way to organize employees you need to lead workers rather than manage employees this is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work 4. national boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries innovations in an industry do n't necessarily come from within the industry anymore further national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business drucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries a declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older new relationships must be forged with older workers especially knowledge workers companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage managers must become change leaders who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity
peter drucker an editorial columnist for the wall street journal a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world 's most respected management thinkers his books over 20 of them have been called the landmarks of the managerial profession '' by the harvard business review he has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought in 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams ' in 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers ' concept here drucker lays out six of the 'new ' challenges facing the businesses of the early century first involves management 's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people there is no 'one size fits all ' approach the method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value ' employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers 'persuaded ' rather than 'ordered ' the next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape the collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for global competitiveness is a must for survival performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers ' to their mission third is becoming a change leader educate others that change equals opportunity regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company study what is working or not in the market with other companies do n't confuse motion with action fourth are the information challenges the purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity competence and allocation of scarce resources information the fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers ' into high productivity attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow differing from manual laborers knowledge workers carry the 'means of production ' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work the sixth challenge is managiing ourself ourselves the biggest possible increase in production lies here intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance concentrate on your strengths avoid trying to change yourself ask yourself what your strengths are determine how you work do you like to work alone would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker what are your values this type of questioning will help determine where you belong most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once you must learn what makes 'you ' tick five stars
this book is first published in 1999. right in the beginning drucker defined management as not only business management but management in all kinds of organization government university hospital army organization etc the book is easy to read just below 200 pages the scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is it describes the certainties collapsing birthrate shift in performance global competitiveness etc and of course how it affects all kinds of organizations it talks about information challenges the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century concepts like individuals will outlive their organization '' how to defines one 's goal and contribution '' are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face since this is the realities i highly recommend this book to anyone not just but those want to know more about oneself how to behave and contribute in this knowledge base world
regrettably peter drucker passed away just a few days after i picked up this 1999 release at the age of 89 in 1999 drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business his chapter on information challenges '' at 38 pages one of the longest in the book drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data few companies exemplify this better than with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer drucker recognized that more and more people in the workforce and most knowledge works will have to manage themselves '' emphasis in original drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives something he himself did as drucker put it in his introduction the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century with this book as with all of his others drucker may be gone physicially but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come jerr
if you manage a large firm be responsible and read it
drucker is a master at business management and a great visionary this book is a must for anyone planning for the future

harper neeld 's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author 's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband interviews with other and discussions of phases of the grieving process i would rate this book highly along with one of my favorite grief authors thanatologist alan wolfelt understanding your grief books harper neeld seamlessly combines her painful personal story with factual helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks i have read on widowhood i used the introspective questions with my grief therapist who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught
my friends keep telling me i should write a book about my grief but i think that what elizabeth harper neeld has written is better than anything i could produce this book is so readable and covers every aspect of grief my husband died four months ago and i have found this book exceedingly helpful elixabeth put the most important step first to experience and express grief fully '' there are hundreds of ways to run away from grief but it is necessary to feel it to heal it '' i was given the best advice by a friend who said to lean into the pain '' the second choice to endure with patience '' has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself thank you elizabeth for this beautiful book i will buy it for everyone i know who loses someone dear
after my husband died suddenly i was beside myself my aunt insisted on placing this book in my hands it has been a lifeline to me i have purchased well over 20 copies of it for friends and continue to haunt my local bookstore when they do n't have it on the shelf for immediate purchase having read almost every grief book out there do n't waste your money just buy this one and learn to live again
my husband of 1.5 years but my of a lifetime passed away a year ago i have read so many books of grief but only seven choices helped me find hope this book is an honest account of a difficult journey and like all things that are done with honesty it touches the core of who we are
i bought this book in audio for a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer after 44 years of marriage the day it arrived she listened to both tapes and said she could so identify with the author she thanked me profusely for this gift and said she was going to listen to it in her car as she drove her husband has only been dead a month as of this writing and neither of us expects her to heal '' in record time but she found comfort in this book and made me so glad this is the one i chose to send her based on her comments i strongly recommend it to the grieving especially widows
this is a great guide that i recommend to all of you who are looking for scholarships check this out thoroughly and if you feel you 're up to the total scholarship plus being paid for training that west point offers i recommend that you then go on to read west point character leadership education '' by norman thomas remick to understand the importance of this college that is the best kept secret and the one that everyone has a good chance of getting into
it covered a lot of ground i feel like i got my money 's worth
tobias writes a bible in personal financial investment without the lack of humor and personal touch he is clear on investing principles he preaches states his opinions precisely and still provide overviews of investments he believes are pure baloney american investors would be thrilled that he goes indepth with certain investments and terms but international readers might skip 30 of this book that deals with investment products policies and law regarding the subject in us
this is the only investment book i can get my husband to read i gave copies of the 1987 edition to my sons when they graduated from college and i am giving them the 2005 edition as they approach 40. tobias has been consistent with his advice over the years he does not promise to make you rich but he gives guidelines for ending up with a comfortable retirement partly by getting one to acknowledge what one does not know he helps create a saving mind set his explanations are clear and useful even for more sohpsticated investors than i am plus i enjoy his sense of humor which makes for an enjoyable read
i can honestly say this book changed my life by opening my eyes on how investing and money really work over the long term
i have found the advice in this book to be invaluable you simply ca n't go wrong those looking for a book with fund investing howtos should keep looking however this is a broad brush stroke at handling one 's money period if you are going to read this book be sure to read my vast fortune as well the two tell quite a story and show that mr tobias is not just blowing air between his gums this book is eminently readable and there is just not much wrong with it everything from what to do if you inherit wealth to what type of life insurance to buy to how to buy a car to how to use the internet to save money on staying at a hotel are covered as well as everything in between read this and prosper
it 's clear easy to understand and remember also entertaining and insightful
first and foremost tobias has a keen sense of humor which makes this book an enjoyment to read in my opinion that is the most important thing because if a book is dull albeit with good advice then you 're probably not going to get much from it the examples and suggestions make this something for everyone not just the wealthy this was the first investment book that i had ever purchased and although it is n't the only one i own it 's the one i refer to most often i 've never taken a business class and my career is completely unrelated but i needed something to help me plan my finances i learned an extraordinary about from tobias and i definitely feel confident going into the investment world i 've since began buying this book for my siblings as a college graduation gift i think that you ca n't go wrong purchasing this item
i enjoy andrew tobias ' writings he is witty concise and intelligent while i do n't agree with all of his advice most of his reasoning stands up i also highly recommend tyson 's investing for dummies personal finance for dummies and mutual funds for dummies
i read this book because of i thought it was going to be funny and it was but i was not expecting to learn anything new having read several books on investing so i got a pleasant surprise when i actually did learn something i would say this would be a great first investment book to read btw if you are looking for more humorous and worthwhile investment books a rare thing out there i would recommend where are the customers ' yachts '' and the money game

danielle steele is a writer who wields the written word like an artist using story lines that attract you by their sheer difference from what people experience in their own tame '' lives widowhood single parenting trauma and grudging admiration make this story compelling a tear jerker i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the talent of a successful story teller

the beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end the house on hope st has tones of her earlier and much superior book accident '' which i highly recommend pick it up for a good read but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor everything is textbook romance
this book is a predictable love story what we 've all come to love about danielle steel 's books perhaps we 'd like a bit more unpredictability but most of the time i enjoy the story anyway reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have that 's always a good thing it also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you you could probably survive this was n't her best book but i thought it was decent if you want to read a really great love story by steel check out the ring to love again summers end answered prayers passions promise
august escoffier was known as the king of chefs and the chef of kings '' this book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts escoffier defined the benchmark for classic french cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music you can find essences of classic french cooking in even the lowliest diner fare much of what is taught in culinary schools today is based on escoffier 's tecniques by purchasing this book you are getting this information straight from the horse 's mouth so to speak rather than with the possibility of influences instilled by the instructor skewing the information i believe the most surprising section of the book is that dealing with treatments for various types of game this section contains comprehensive instructions for dealing with a wide variety of game from buffalo to venison that are very useful today i have noticed in at least two places escoffier appears to contradict himself i believe this is due to the problems with translation and if you follow carefully what he is saying you can figure out the correct meaning
i am very annoyed that people who do not have any idea of what this book is have the audacity to rate it if you made the mistake of buying this book thinking it was a cookbook that is your own fault ! please do n't rate escoffiers culinary writings based on your own stupidity as other reviewers have pointed out this is a reference guide or encyclopedia of french cooking and not a cookbook the author assumes that you have more than basic knowledge of french cooking and has no glossy pretty pictures it is complicated yet simple and an is indispensable guide for anybody that wishes to research classic french cooking to give an example of how this book is arranged if you wanted to prepare a velout alboufera first you would have to know what a velout is and how to prepare a basic velout then you would follow the directions to prepare a velout d ' ecrevisses and finish with a liaison of egg yolks butter and cream if you do n't know that a velout is a type of soup skip this book and please please for those of you that made the mistake of buying it please do n't rate it !
it has been said that the true test of any work whether it be a piece of art music or a book is the test of time this volume has done just that ! first written almost 100 years ago these recipes are just as relavent today as they were in escoffier 's time please be aware that this book is not for the beginner the author assumes that the reader has developed the skills and methods that are needed in any kitchen i have worked professionally as a chef for 25 years and assure you that this work will always be on my bookshelf when it comes to classic french cuisine this work is indispensible
this is the book on classic french technique and cuisine by the master chef auguste escoffier this the english translation of the edition of the guide culinaire by cracknell and kaufmann and it supersedes translations of the guide to modern cookery 1907 this is the real '' english translation with over brief recipes for sauces garnishes soups hors d'oeuvres eggs fish poultry game garde manger vegetables desserts ice creams and ices on and on ! do n't waste your money on the new abridged versions which have less than or less than recipes as you 'll be missing thousands of recipes and their commentary for no good reason ! classic terms are clearly defined and described and just about any recipe you have heard of in french cooking is here this is for intermediate level and up cooks and chefs as unlike conventional cookbooks a knowlege of cooking is presumed lest this be far more than than it 's 646 pages in length there are no pictures none are really needed some recipes do make a gallon of sauce rather than just enough for a couple or foursome to enjoy so scale back or freeze a lot ! why read it for me it 's living culinary history and the recipes can make one drool with their simplicity or lushness it 's the source of thousands of tried and true '' recipes unsullied by fusion '' fads or foolishness where a souffle '' defines anything from a pancake to a meringue topping and even molten chocolate brownies '' are also called souffles '' by food writers '' who apparently do not bother to read a recipe nor have made or tasted a true souffle i read the name of a tasty dish at a restaurant and later see how closely it adheres to the recipes of almost a hundred years ago and surprisingly there 's little variation when cooked by a traditional french trained chef there are many pointers on how to prepare things unusual combinations to try how to tie a roast all sorts of tricks of the trade that are passed from one chef to the next and not found in joy of cooking or most celebrity chef recipes if you are serious about learning and appreciating french cuisine do n't need your hand held while evaluating or following a recipe and appreciate access to thousands of classic recipes collected in one book then this is the source and the book for you
great book not for the home maker of course must have a basic understanding of the art this book is great for refference there is no pics only usefull infomatio
i teach culinary arts and this is a must have for every serious cook and future chef you must have some knowledge of professional culinary techniques to be able to understand and use this book as one reviewer wrote this is not a cookbook it is a reference book and my students use it when they have to do research work
the book is probably the best reference i 've seen what it is n't is a cookbook for beginners i 'd recommend it for someone that already knows their way around a kitchen and wants a source for myriad well only 5100 ideas
winchester a geologist and proven writer is a perfect choice for chronicling the 1906 san francisco earthquake i currently live and work in sf and enjoyed listening to the book on my player while commuting in the muni subways true to form winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself and instead develops the events which lead up to the event first in a geological perspective and second in a sociological one unfortunately this book does not come together as well as his book on krakatoa being a current san franciscan i found his history of the city lacking his conclusions about the current christian revival as being strongly influenced by the quake is tenuous but his points about its pyschological impact on society are the best parts of the books were the descriptions of the science and history of plate tectonics as well as the detailed historical descriptions of the quake itself if you 're at all interested in the quake you should pick this up and also try his other books
plate tectontics yawn hey the continents move we all know that but what you did n't know is why what happens with they suddenly move quite quickly if you live along either the northern or southern end of the san andreas fault you owe it to yourself to read this book lets just say i wo n't be living there anytime soon i liked simon 's other book the professor and the madman '' and that book seemed less dry and fragmented than this one but krakatoa and the map that changed the world '' are now both on my reading list for the summer all and all good stuff the way that history should be taught in high school and in this case geology too
a lot of good factual information written in a readable fashion i want my family to read this book anyone who lives in the san francisco bay area should read this ! i 've already ordered another copy as a gift
a crack in the edge of the world '' is a great read that i especially recommend to all whom live have lived or who have simply just visited the san francisco region of california to all these individuals it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906. this book covers that momentous year and much more as well i had the good fortune of living in san francisco for two years in the mid and experienced one relatively small earthquake these tremors from below are no laughing matter they are terrifying one can only guess at the magnitude of the quake of 1906. yet californians are so are they foolhardy or simply ignorant i think the former as no one could be unaware of the brittleness of the ground on which they tread simon winchester 's book provides the reader with a brief history of plate tectonics the precise events of 18 april 1906 as well as some ruminations about the future he puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way his analysis of portola valley as a deeply dangerous place that is liable to be destroyed at any moment '' is courageously and provocatively true i have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb no doubt his further view that many of its houses and offices deserve to be evacuated and abandoned '' will be ignored in the long run he will inevitably be proved prescient winchester probably says much that people particularly those who reside in california do n't want to hear however he is no crackpot rather he is a writer who deserves to be read by a wider audience this book is a great work that i recommend to all that includes the residents of california
a crack in the edge of the world by simon winchester is about the catastrophic 1906 san francisco earthquake and fire this being the centennial of the event there have been a lot of books produced about it but i had heard good things about winchester and his writing so this is the one i picked i 'll have to find another one to read that has the info i was looking for i was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives i wanted to read about families separated and united romances and businesses i wanted to read about human emotion this is not the book for that but that 's not to say that it does n't have merit i learned about plate tectonics the formation of the world the settlement of the american west earthquakes in the midwest and much more but only pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in san francisco and once the fire it put out the book quickly ends there is a little discussion about the rebuilding but mostly just to disparage the effort winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling his research is excellent and i did learn quite a bit enough to sleep well in my stable state of wisconsin and ensure that i 'll never visit california
geologist turned journalist simon winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing of which a crack in the edge of the world america and the great california earthquake of 1906 '' is a very good example however his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books krakatoa '' and the map that changed the world '' for example though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes from plate to shining plate '' it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the new madrid missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811 transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake 's history than a lucid mesmerizing account of north america 's tectonic history for a more lucid better written account one should turn to john mcphee 's books most notably those comprising his annals of the former world '' in a similar vein his chapters on the san francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself but to his credit winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information most notably in his descriptions of seismologist frank richter 's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears richter 's name however if you are interested in a sprawling occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake then a crack in the edge of the world '' may indeed be of interest to you the potential customer and reader
i am always sad to finish one of winchester 's books they are definitely not to be read in one sitting and because they stay with you for so long it is as if you have finished a memorable semester by the time you put the book back on the shelf true they are discursive but wonderfully so and crack '' more than most indeed the cover serves as a hint of things to come folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear if one truly wishes to understand the 1906 san francisco earthquake and the geological sociological historical and other effects that rippled outward in time from the central namesake event one must prepare for a journey as with any great journey some parts are better and more interesting than others but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled suffice it to say that upon completion of crack '' the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world think of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for winchester 's style a style wryly as bloviation his diversions are often entirely unexpected and not always entirely supportable but enjoyable and nonetheless he communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery being able to drive up to alaska for example just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive denali quake being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster pointing to that most californian of attitudes the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to san francisco according to a grand master plan a mistake echoed in southern california 's loss of the redcars in favor of freeways what winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content something along the old timelife science series or the dorling kindersley formats anyone that can work opera immigration arizona 's meteor crater watson lake bashing fault finding geologic and roadtrips into an interesting book about earthquakes needs all the resources he can get give the man a series and run him around the world like michael palin
with the anniversary of the great san francisco earthquake i eagerly anticipated winchester 's latest book i highly enjoyed the map that changed the world '' and krakatoa '' and i expected a similarly great book this time winchester again delivers a wonderful narrative on the san francisco earthquake and the tragedy that befalls the city a lot of his personal narrative is a bit rambling at times but the overall theme of the book the journey across the north american tectonic plate is a good one though i think john mcphee does it better in his book annals of the former world '' winchester again displays an uncanny ability to make the complex plate tectonics understandable i only wished he 'd gone into a bit more detail like he did on krakatoa '' still i enjoyed the book and i recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the san francisco earthquake and the science behind why it happened then and will happen again
the alternate title of this book should be the and only guide to college degrees by mail and internet you will need to read excellent and information regarding courses tuition residency requirements i will finally be able to confidently and comfortably select 'the ' masters program that is right for me ! tuition is quite varied and ranges from low to very high bears ' guide saved me the time and frustration of looking at schools with astronomically high tuition rates if you are just beginning to look at distance learning programs have been looking for awhile and are not able to make a decision or you are just thinking about a dlp this book is essential

and the band played on is an act of phenomenal research and writing and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling political bumbling and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many the scientific which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they did n't want to do the work did n't want to spend the money or did n't want to anger certain political groups gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many it 's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions this book provoked in me anger rage confusion compassion sadness and tears i wish i could thank all those like don francis michael gottlieb selma dritz marc conant dale lawrence paul volberding and arye rubenstein who tried so hard against such overwhelming odds to save lives quickly i would also chastise president ronald reagan and merve silverman and give margaret heckler and bob gallo a piece of my mind the skunks ! i am thankful that there are politicians like orrin hatch and people behind the scenes like bill kraus and cleve jones though he was woefully slow in responding i 'm grateful for the response of everett koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could randy shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the united states and france and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the he also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death enno poersch gary walsh frances borchelt bill kraus and gaetan dugas and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it it was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line the amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding requiring shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material in reading this book my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed it is a great tragedy that aids killed randy shilts as it had killed so many other innocents and that as i write this there is still no cure for aids as far as i can tell it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community where will the next randy shilts bill kraus and gottlieb and the other saviors come from and will they come soon enough
good stories work on several levels they are views of the same event to honor the anniversary of the beginning of the aids epidemic i reread randy shilts 's groundbreaking work which was published a mere six years after the reports of a cancer ' first surfaced at the cdc it is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease shilts who tested positive during the research for his book but said he did n't ask for the results until his writing was finished nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research his regret he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal as a result and the band played on '' survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice fear and love exuberance and panic loss and redemption contrasts that the play angels in america '' perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991. shilts explored aids in america as a disease of both body and spirit seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances it 's a timeless and priceless view
to me this important expose on the begining of the aids crises and reagan 's response is extremely important it 's now classic and old information but it 's a valuable history lesson we all must read
the sexual revolution is over wrote an old revolutionist named o'rourke and the microbes won this book by an sf journalist now dead from aids tells how the microbes won the war author randy shilts tells the story of playgrounds on america 's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses aids was n't the gay plague shilts reports it was the or gay plague nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of stonewall 's closet gay sexual activists took it for granted writes shilts that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases when the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early did n't magically appear sexual athletes did what any normal americans would do they blamed reagan shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game his scorn for bath house behaviors for blood banks is loud clear of reagan is muted reagan after all had other wars and a rocky economy on his hands by the time shilts ' book became a tv however reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain if only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved after all we are now told we all have aids ponder what reagan might have said if he 'd been convinced by koop or somebody to speak the name of aids in 1982 or 1983 well as your mothers probably should have told you reagan being a realist understood that aids in america overwhelmingly a behavioral disease read and the band played on in tandem with dragon within the gates by stephen joseph former health commissioner of new york city and former clintonista these books together are the best war reporting of the recent past they show how microbes won the war and how microbes then won civil rights
you want to read a horror story this is it this is the shameful way our government dealt with aids in the first six years it appeared in the by doing nothing at all everyone ignored it the cdc the nih the national cancer institute it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors and they were ignored too over 2000 gay men and hemophiliacs and straight people and babies died before the government even acknowleged that yes something new was going around newspapers and media did not report this because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a gay disease '' gay men did n't want to discuss that it might '' be spread through sex and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of liberation was unthinkable blood banks would n't even acknowlege the fact that their products were contaminated even after it was proven that transfusion aids was possible and happening by the time president reagan first uttered the word aids over americans were dead from the disease this book made me cry the entire way through it i wanted to scream i wanted to throw things i wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too a university official that was denying aids researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark well at least aids is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people '' how absolutely disgusting this is a dauntingly large 621 pages of reading all of it frustrating angering and yet still inspiring they did n't give up no one threw in the towel until their last breath or until funding sufficient funding was finally granted sadly the author himself died of aids in 1994. god bless everyone who worked so hard to make aids a household word which finally happened oh about seven stinking years after it first started killing people in the us what the heck is wrong with this country why did people have their heads in the sand for so long what 's so stinking wrong with us another book everyone should read if only to know how our government helped spread aids around the world by ignoring it for six damn years how many people did they kill by doing that far far too many we were the last civilized nation to institute an aids program this book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more and i did n't think that was possible god bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with aids
having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy it is extremely informative and if read with an open mind refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on '' just to let the information sink in
having seen the film that this book is based on several times i was curious to read into the whole story and this book does not pack any punches whilst i did not expect a 'g ' rated book i certianly did not expect some of the in depth writing that is included however it is all relevant to the story definately a book for our times
i was required to read this text for a class i would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure i found that this text is very attention grabbing and it is extremly informational i would recommend this text to others
shilts ' great book shows us how much of the aids related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided the book opens with the july 1976 bicentennial celebration of american independence and closes with the death of hollywood star rock hudson whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous aids casualties could not in between the book revolves around the hedonistic community of san francisco 's castro street area and brings us an amazing array of villains victims and plain heroes the villains include the bathhouse owners who used america 's first amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus bob gallo of america 's national cancer institute who put his own prestige ahead of everything else normal scientific and academic ethics included and the reagan administration which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted america during those years because the air bridges between los angeles new york and san francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed shilts also introduces us to gaetan dugas the canadian air line steward who is credited with infecting many of america 's earliest victims shilts paints him as half victim and half villain dugas he shows went from being the pretty boy everybody in castro street wanted to bed to being the terminal aids case they all eventually feared rock hudson liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims michael foucault the fashionable french philosopher must rank with the vilest villains he hid his diagnosis from everyone even his devoted lover so much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer ! but even in the blighted world of aids there were many heroes these include the french scientists who discovered the hiv virus and gallo excepted the american ones who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness many of these american heroes shilts shows were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind the bathhouse chain owners who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming aids were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years the blood banks by refusing to screen blood also contributed to the death of thousands of americans the reagan administration 's preoccupation with central america and the soviet union was also a godsend to the virus and as the band played on aids wormed its way through america 's marginalized communities of hookers hemophiliacs heroin addicts and haitians gay activists who tried to sound the alarm bells were dismissed as sexual nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in castro street 's backroom bars and bathhouses even though as shilts constantly reminds us it meant almost certain death shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril aids means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later the world 's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for aids hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues so too will other marginalized and uneducated people so too of course will people like robert gallo who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity 's on the positive side the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes not the least of whom is randy shilts who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity
i teach practical game theory for executives this book its an excellent complementary material for the course
if you are really into learning microeconomics right form the start this is the book for
i am an unabashed admirer of howard zinn but i am tremendously impressed with paul johnson 's a history of the american people i read this book while attending graduate school years after reading zinn 's fascinating people 's history of the united states johnson 's interrogation of the polemic characters social movements and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and although i consider myself a moderate liberal i was intrigued on how johnson describes certain historical figures for instances unlike zinn johnson reveres business potentates such as rockefeller and drew for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century he is exceedingly critical of thomas jefferson but he adulates andrew jackson for his gallantry during the battle of new orleans i recommend students scholars general readers and history buffs to read this book with zinn 's people 's history to procure a understanding of american history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation
while i would n't recommend that my students read only paul johnson 's work on us history i would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the american than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today he does not shy away from criticism where it is due but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due even if it means offending some politically correct ears while i agree that he can be classified as a conservative i would also note that this is not a conservative 's conservative '' book by that i mean that people who are unabashedly republican religious right will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history while johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures he does so on a basis always aiming to support his evaluations with fact in many instances these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks they are not however smelling of the party line indeed johnson 's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship research and deep analysis his coverage of forgotten '' spans of time grant arthur hayes garfield is welcome as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage lincoln jfk i found the chapters to be personally most enlightening johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life he is not a social or sociological commentator which will relieve some of his more liberal readers and in fact i believe most people liberal or conservatve would gain an awful lot from his research and presentation if they read with an open mind
paul johnson 's history of the american people is a great response to howard zinn 's work johnson 's offers a conservative take on much of the events and people that zinn criticizes harshly the book is a fairly optimistic work speaking to the resilience and ingenuity of the american people i particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the nixon and coolidge presidency and his criticisms of jfk paul johnson has an interesting perspective on american history as he did not learn about as a child growing up in england he appproaches american history with a certain zeal not found in other historian 's works i really enjoyed reading the book after reading zinn 's work
i had to read this for a us history class i took in college and when i received it groaned at the size of the book but when i started reading it i found that i really enjoyed it it gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book its a big one but very interesting so you wo n't mind that at all like one of the other reviewers mentioned i wish that i did n't have to stop and highlight and take notes as i was reading because this could be purely a '' leisurely '' read if you are into history
this is perhaps the best concise history of the united states out there johnson writes beautifully and unlike howard zinn he does not let ideology completely dominate the book but be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one as it 's a heavyweight
i had to read this book for my college us history class this is the most interesting history book i have ever read besides making a good college text this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature true he does go on and on about how good the north american weather is but i say this is only natural for a british chap SMILE it is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book a history of the american people reads a bit like alexis de tocqueville 's democracy in america in that it is a european that is just fascinated by our experiment in republican
this has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a british historian the author admittedly is a strong admirer of the american people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live he supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey we are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that i studied going through school in the 1930 's and 1940 's alas maybe washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all
johnson brings the history of the united states to life in profound and exciting ways i now emerge from four months of reading and intensive cross study with a well marked copy of this book and a better understanding of our great nation than ever before i am already anticipating certain portions in order to use them in teaching more than anything this book has helped me to reawaken a passion for history learning and understanding johnson 's unique voice has become that of an old and wise friend that calls us to take back up the moral imperative that has made this country great i recommend this book very highly especially to teachers ministers parents and anyone else who has a part in shaping the minds of others this is a vital missing link in a complete education
at over pages of information this book looks very intimidating it 's so fascinating however and so well constructed that the pages go by very quickly entertaining and highly educational
i really enjoyed this book in that its not the usual wine and roses type text he shows america warts and all and i found it most refreshing well done
i just reread this book for the second time i have n't read it since it came out a few years ago i enjoyed it this time around as much as i did the first time the book has everything mystery romance humor and sadness it 's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end the main plot is around callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on tv she is approached by a woman suzanne who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant after some investigating and tests suzanne is proved correct but a baby scheme is uncovered in the process callie is determined to get to the bottom of it while that is going on she has to deal with her jake being brought in on her dig he 's an anthropologist i do n't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed reconciled and explored callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval it is a wonderful love story and mystery i think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction
the story seems to go on forever it is a novel after all a very long one each character possesses own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession the final showdown is worth the reading and waiting it is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery who is the person behind all the killings romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception conveniently dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case her own that leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth the man she never gets over is there to win her heart again her brother who she did n't grow up with has his own love interest a divorced couple find each other once more everything boils down to loyalty among friends lovers and family members not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading
roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer this is a gripping story i was glued to the book till the very end
as the previous reviewers have already stated this story encompasses many plots all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another callie dunbrook archeologist out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team her jake graystone not only do callie and jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of woodsboro md callie has a bigger surprise in store for her the discovery of a birth mother father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction this story plays many different angles but nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters doug lana little ty suzanne jay vivian and elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team and i especially like digger ! definitely a nora book you wo n't want to miss birthright is a great find
this is one of nora roberts ' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite i adore this book the characters are interesting and very human the plot is gripping and the background fascinating callie an archeologist comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment like most romances including roberts definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
i have been a longtime fan of robert 's work lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive this was refreshingly new and i read it twice before putting it down there are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book everything from baby selling to ancient civilizations their cultures to theories of ghosts curses to dealing with in the workplace only roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing here is the version witty and beautiful archaeologist callie dunnbrook is sent to small town woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site unfortunately the town is n't that friendly when people start vanishing many wonder could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site but her partner for the dig sent from the university is none other than her jake ! ! to make matters worse local famous baker suzanne smith 's claims callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant only problem is callie was n't adopted or was she poor callie must decipher clues to the past suzanne 's jake 's the remains in the ground and her own as the old adage proves true secrets never last forever
this book is worth reading if only for his journalistic sections of his personal stay in an abandoned station in the arctic also his section which describes the equipment used is pretty fun to read once you 've finished the story i found sections of the rifles to be quite monotonous and the historical thread seems to run a lot thinner here than in dreams 1 and 2
having now read all four currently published dreams in this series the rifles which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages 70 of source notes glossaries etc seems the most strange and it is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue historical research and imagination the franklin expedition of to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume 's take on the larger series theme of european and native american interaction two central aspects of this theme are the canadian relocation of inuit peoples in the 1950 's from quebec to various arctic islands and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples as in each of the other dreams vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the '' having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children 's and jutting from a tranquil sea landscape descriptions are consistent in their portrayal of desolation serenity and danger as vollmann states in an it is a sort of to the ice shirt both take place in the north american arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the ages '' in which each novel dwells beyond the historical contexts of this novel there is the sad twisted love story '' between the modern girl reepah subzero who should be added to the list of counterparts i mention in my review of argall but this is no ordinary love since it sometimes involves captain franklin his wife the author himself and the inuit goddess sedna the author 's subzero exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with captain franklin as though time and place were immaterial in fact distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it 's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters on page 120 vollmann or is it subzero asks are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you '' there are similar sequences in the ice shirt and to lesser degrees in fathers crows and argall each work uniquely powerful worthwhile but here in the most modern '' dream this timelessness is much more pronounced sound confusing check out the source notes for hints clues if necessary but it definitely helps to stay alert to which voices '' are speaking the narrative frequently alters between and and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author 's own adventures in arctic quebec in relation to for insight into the original franklin expeditions with vollmann 's seven dreams series it 's best to read on and not get bogged down because a lot of stuff that does n't make sense at first will make sense later next up volume 7 cloud shirt from what i understand this will be about the hopi navajo in the american southwest during the 's volume 4 poison shirt might be about king phillip the great swamp war of the century and volume 5 dying grass is slated to cover chief joseph of the nez pierce plains indians whatever he turns out whenever i ca n't wait vollmann 's dream series is forcing a much needed in the consciousness of the various ages '' of our north american continent
i enjoyed reading the rifles quite a bit that being said it was not quite up to par with the ice shirt the plight of the native people of northern canada it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves is not something one usually reads about while there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the great white explorers '' and have little to do with those living there i enjoy how vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters leaving them to become real humans i will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment
although though it may be hard to begin vollmann 's 7 dreams '' series because each book in the series is so massive it is certainly worth the time not only is vollman attempting to create with some fiction the entire history of north america each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking new people names histories and unique grammar reflective to the period a truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears but since each is complete in itself that does not matter i look forward to his next quot
this book was given to me the copy i have is the 1932 printing i know now how lucky i am to own it after finishing it was very hard to put down other books i have read about him did n't touch on his gentleness and how it affected not only his marriage but the war sometimes i think now he worried too much about others feelings such as inept generals and that lunatic wife mary todd who 's temper tantrums were infamous like he had enough rocks in his sack without strife at home i so pity him even now that he is beyond all cares and woe god bless you sir and give you the peace that so eluded you here on earth
the storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes americans do n't have to abraham lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic this book is a labor of love by carnegie about his hero it 's his way of making his hero available to us all i love particularly the introduction in which carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it this is one of the best books i 've ever read all the wisdom and insight carnegie ever collected in his how to '' books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here because lincoln exemplified everything that carnegie ever taught this book is what will keep carnegie 's name alive long after his institute has folded and his how to '' books have gone out of print in this book carnegie captures the living reality of lincoln his wisdom his virtues his beautiful and unfettered english prose his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind his deep reverence and his abiding love this is a book that you never finish the experience remains with you besides changing forever the way you think about lincoln it 'll change the way you think about yourself this book is not overtly religious but i 'd recommend it alongside bonhoeffer 's cost of discipleship chesterton 's everlasting man and thomas merton 's mountain
if you do n't know anything about lincoln this book is for you ! the author carnegie was enthralled with lincoln and by the end of the book you will be too the book does an excellent job portraying who loncoln was from childhood to adult to presidency it was the first book i ever read on lincoln and i ended up learning so much about this superlative man a great introduction to lincoln
i agree with oceandweller who said wished this book were still in print so could send a copy to all friends this book is terrific right from page one until the very end i bought this book used i forget how much i paid whatever i paid it was worth it it 's not often in one 's lifetime that one comes across a book like this both educational and entertaining dale carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just ca n't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends not only was the story so interesting but lincoln comes across as the wisest of men with malice towards none and charity for all '' these his words keep echoing in my mind though he fought the civil war a terribly bloody war he did this to save this great nation his words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies ' st luke lincoln had no church he said when i do good i feel good when i do bad i feel bad and that 's my religion '' but through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to after reading this book for me lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom i know something there may be others like him but i have n't met or read about them this book should be required reading in all the high schools in my humble opinion
i first read this book in early 1994. it left a lasting impression on me the account of abraham lincoln 's life is remarkably written by dale carnegie this is not the story about the lincoln that we learned about in school lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest presidents carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the white house we can see the problems that lincoln had while in the office of president it would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if lincoln had not been president because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable for example the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly this book should be read by anyone who has an interest in political science or just wants to know more about the president this is a very interesting book that i found hard to put down i have read this many times and i cherish each moment that i spend reading the book
all i can say is if you really want to get most out of your life and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day you should read this book
i recieved this book which is how to win friends and influence people '' and how to stop worrying and start living '' in one edition as a gift from a dale carnegie instructor thanks again ron ! this has been quite possible the greatest gift anyone has given me i recommend this book to anybody and everybody reading this book will increase your confidence and your skills incredibly not reading it would be a punishment to yourself and you deserve better
a lost love he mourned for his whole life an extremely difficult wife endless attempts to undermine his authority constant personal sorrow who knew this book helped me understand and admire lincoln the man versus lincoln the president they are both likable characters
this is a thoroughly engrossing book i could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother 's collection of old books it inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that i do this book talks about the lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes i was impressed with the fact that lincoln totally despised slavery especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers his triumphs and failures make him seem much more human not only was he a great president but a great human being as well it illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain if you can get your hands on this book it is a must read
it is a superbly written book about one of the greatest leaders that mankind has known it is amazing how lincoln from humble origins shaped up to become so great he is an insipiration to all i only wish that this book was in print i would send it to several of my friends
i have been a manager for over 10 years and have worked in different industries and different countries and i gladly admit i still have a lot to learn concerning management this book talks about concepts we know we should all be applying such as learning from mistakes responsibility and organization attention to details as well as to a master plan communication etc however understanding how churchill put these concepts to work is fascinating i did not know that much about churchill in the first place perhaps that is why i enjoyed the book so much it is a nice change from ceos ' biographies and yes i am putting some of what i read to work so it was worth my time and money
as we all know too well in the flow of flotsam from academe there is seldom material that is both readable and edifying often neither quality is present this book churchill on leadership scores high in both categories hayward 's obvious in depth knowledge of churchill and his times enabled him to organize the vast storehouse of material available into a useful and unique way of teaching the leadership principles churchill personified god knows the lak of leadership today evidences the extreme need for what hayward has wrought
churchill 's leadership and perseverance carry this book the lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial as if summing up churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims what mr hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us women included i learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work i too can work on my he had many failures some fatal for a politician but continued to soldier on i too can persevere he stuck with his own sense of when every one else proclaimed him as finished i too can maintain confidence against adversity the maxims mr hayward are not needed but thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth where we can all learn from his extraordinary life
steven hayward places churchill 's experience and approach to executive problem solving into historical context this is a must read book for students of leadership management as well as fans of sir winston a relatively short book about such a significant topic but well worth the tim
i love these examples explanations books the rules make sense when you can get decent examples and these books do a good job of that if you find your outline frustrating like emmanuels gilberts both of which drive me nuts with frustration try the finals series books i like them much better as outlines than the official outlines ''
great book definitely does n't cover every area of torts that you 're going to need to know for your course iied false imprisonment get gilberts or emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though also if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules even if it 's just a difference in semantics use your prof 's rules when working the examples writing out your answers to the examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you wo n't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester
the book is great as it is no doubt but the older editions do not have products liability in them which is vital to your studies make sure you get the latest edition which has two chapters on pl aside from that one missing element in the older edition the rest of the book is excellent
this book is very easy to read and allows for easy digestion of complex principles i find it to be very useful in understanding torts
very seldom is a sequel better than the original terminator 2 comes to mind along with perhaps the empire strikes back and the aliens series but for the most part sequels suck the opposite is true in law school support texts i borrowed the edition of this book from a friend and found it to be utter crap think crap on the level of the third austin powers or the mummy returns it was almost as if glannon during a celebration over the success of his civ pro e e success got hammered and wrote torts e e and eds in a drunken stupor it seems though that for the ed he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor it 's still not civ pro e e which single handedly rescued me from oblivion and likely suicide in that course but it is definitely worth having
for some reason i think amazon 's reviews bleed through different editions ie you will find reviews of the edition on the editions page this often misleads distorts the promotion of a product the newest editions of examples explanations are fabulous and settle a few issues that may have been present in the past all to often students expect these to be comprehensive outlines like emanuels that do all the work for them the grades come to those who work and that is where this series shines it gives you practice and furthers understanding
this book was actually recommended for our torts class and i am so glad it was glannon is a great writer and he makes things easy and fun to read sometimes he is a little too punny his examples are a great help too especially around exam time his practice exams are great at helping you to spot the issues and organize them clearly glannon also wrote examples and explanations for civil pro that is highly recommended also
buy this and high court summaries keyed to your casebook and you 're set i also used the gilberts and sum and substance tapes while commuting to school the best preparation with the least effort awesome ! this book make torts my best subject even though i forgot a lot of details the substance stayed with me for and it got me an a in torts i 'd recommend reading prior to the first year and then reviewing as you complete each chapter during the semester awesome especially since glannon includes a sample exam good luck trying to find many profs to offer that ! an absolute must for ! you will get your money 's worth and if you keep it in good shape you 'll find another to buy it from you when you 're done with it unless you keep it for bar review this book is like good foreign cars the resale value stays up
my first complete dickens book was a tale of two cities '' since that was an idealistic romance novel this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature instead of sacrifices i found painful ingratitude instead of perfect heroines i found scheming insensitive women this book was not anything i expected with regards to characterization and theme however i would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much much better it was not a very entertaining read at all but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better this book may not turn one 's daydreams on paper but it is a solid landmark work of literature
perhaps the greates novel i have ever read not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life you ca n't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance
first of all in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos all i can say is that i hope that they did n't read the book for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic i digress i am here to dispel some myths since this book is often assigned in school and perceived as important '' as another reviewer noted i think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand dickens ' novels however work on multiple level there certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel but on the surface it 's just a good read i read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it so do n't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you one piece of advice read the real ending before the changed ending though the changed one will appear first i felt that the original one was far better more relevant and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first happy reading
of all the dickens novels i 've read this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life in terms of art this is probably his supreme achievement the plot is n't as convoluted as it is in bleak house the action is more dramatic the female characters particularly estella are more believable and in the case of miss havisham for instance more intriguing the sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control the humor still abounds the language is easier to read but no less descriptive no it 's not a perfect work there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents and far too many ridiculous coincidences but to me at least great expectations is dickens ' greatest achievement
read it no matter what no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years get into it and you wo n't be able to put it down and then you 'll think that reviewer was right i love this book it was the best book that i read in my junior year it was n't required reading but it should be ! and miss havisham and estella ! after reading about the endless virtues of lucy manette in a tale of two cities i found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected read the book love the book accept the book and all of its truths and then name your cat pip
great expectations is filled with ambition greed cruelty and love it is one of the best books i have ever read in my high school years get entertained with joe and her violence towards pip and her husband joe gargery also pip travels to france to become a gentlemen which is one of the best parts of this novel
great expectations by charles dickens was a very good novel in my eyes the main character pip believed as a true victorian that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions upon recieving his great expectations he moves to london for a further education and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen through pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be and his views of a true gentlemen start to change with thanks to dickens and great expectations we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen he may start as a poor orphan boy like pip or labour as a blacksmith like joe truly what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen and social prestige has not a bit to do with it
dickens explores various sides of human nature in great expectations as he tells the story of pip a common laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman along the storyline dickens inserts several points that man has several sides the book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur how quickly man can turn on his closest friend a very well written story great expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences
this book is well written and very ambitious in its scope it is fascinating to get a people 's eye '' view of the rise of sun yat additionally it empathically covers the social response to mixed marriages by two very different cultures this is a women orienated book about a very tumultous time and ties the events together skillfully in the western and the emerging china of 100 years ago
using stories told by her grandfather aimee liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in china the story starts in san francisco at the time of the big quake it is a love story of an american girl and a very educated chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a chinese person much less married one her husband is a part of sun 's battle to topple the manchu dynasty within the novel is the history of china from the opium war in 1840 to the communist 's war of liberation in 1949. good insight into the people of china and their relationship with the western powers
i had to write a few words every now and then i hit upon an author that pulls and pushes at your heart i listen to dozens of audio books every month driving to and from work this story was so very well written it has real life in it it has passion love danger devotion understanding pain it has it all it is a must for historical and just plain enjoyment reasons the plot is in the description i must now seek out other books by this author if you want to fill moments of your life with a treasure include this story doroth
while i do n't believe that elizabeth was totally the excellent strategizer i do believe she was well advised and did her own thinking this book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by and how it would apply in business today there are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples the major portion of the book covers the image that elizabeth set forth by taking on being the image of the mother mary catholic church to her subjects thus to make the people more accepting of the new church of england as the religious seat of power thus diffusing the vatican 's hold over the people my only complaint like others opinions there were no mention of where things went wrong only highlighting the good things this is a very good book still and i recommend it along with another book called big chief elizabeth which is more of the history of the new world and elizabeth 's funding of the voyages to capture more land
elizabeth i ceo was a wonderful reading that inspired me a lot my wife and i kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished the lessons of elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring i never thought that i would need a book on inspiration in my life but this book indeed changed this view as well excellent work
i do have a comment on history content in response to one of other reviews i read 's keep in mind that if it was n't for elizabeth i there would be no empire to pass along to james would be swallowed up by either france or spain surely elizabeth i made a few mistakes like every other monarch but they fade out in comparison to her achievements she truly did build an empire and serves as a great example of a true leader tudor schola
oriana fallaci died recently and loss will be felt in the europe that decided to ignore her once she voiced her criticism of it mindless poltical correctness that threatens its very existence the force of reason '' is a call for europe to wake up and fight back against islamization fallaci knew her time was limited when she wrote this book in a way it is to be regretted that not only was she aware of her impending death but that she decided to do her own english version fallaci 's english was not up to the task and as a result the book is an unnecessarily difficult read which will understandably put many people off too bad because fallaci 's message is important fallaci correcetly perceives the menace of islam in europe she recognizes the mass migration of muslims and their refusal to assimilate as an invasion intended to conquer europe she laments loudly and shrilly the craven cowardice of the politically correct left what really infuriated europe 's liberals was fallaci 's tracing of their history back through their origins as socialists fascists and communists fallaci distinguishes between the left '' of days and the left '' that emerged after wwii and predominates in europe today fallaci engages in a lot of comments talking about her martyrdom '' she was badly treated by the intellectuals in europe who did not like her message her is understandable but a distraction fallaci 's message is simple in the end the decline of intelligence is he decline of reason refusing to admit that all islam is a pond inside which we are drowning in fact is against '' fallaci provides more than ample evidence of her latter point which proves the former many will not appreciate fallaci 's message but no one will be able to disprove her facts jerr
a comprhensive expose ' of islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in america that the muslims are just like us ''
if you are up to challenge your own traditional views and the daily bland diet of information that is churned by the conventional media and pundits on the oral and written media then you are for a ride ! the author compels critical action from her readers if you are up to challenge your very own traditional views on islam and not satisfied with the bland diet of information that is churned by the conventional media and pundits then you are for a ride ! whether you agree with author or not she compels you to critical mental and emotional reaction
oriana fallaci is no longer among the living we will have to do without her unrelenting opposition to islamic nihilism she died in the united states her fellow europeans essentially expelled her from the continent they made fallaci 's final years a living hell as an i am more then a little irritated by the roman church 's capitulation to the radical muslims fallaci described herself as a christian atheist and was more of a defender of the true faith '' than its own hierarchy ! this catholic church without which the islamization of europe the degeneration of europe into eurabia could have never have developed this catholic church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted '' added the author fallaci rebukes the politically correct and cowardly european culture which is unwilling to combat islam 's racist sexist and homophobic doctrines fallaci quotes denis diderot 's accurate description of islam as the enemy of reason '' the and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of mohammed can not be disputed what has the muslim world accomplished in the last years will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the century are there any life affirming moderate muslims if so where are they oriana fallaci deserves a statue erected in her honor will her memory encourage us during our inevitable future trials and tribulations i strongly believe that this will indeed be the case david thomson flares into darknes
the force of reason '' by the late oriana fallaci is an interesting book which provides criticisms of islam while exploring the possibility of widespread conquest of western civilizations and europe by the muslims apparently the opposition was not too pleased with the force of reason '' or her previous publication the rage and the pride '' as they have attempted numerous times to have the text banned and fallaci has also been the proud recipient of numerous threatening messages as a result of this yet the text has become a bestseller in europe and apparently north america as well as the book is currently ranked at 8 on this site 's bestseller list as of today she shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named master cecco who in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the troy burnings fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them
this is high octane stuff and not for the faint of heart fallaci pulls no punches
oriana fallaci is the rocky marciano of italian letters to her the best defense is a good offense if you 're you will hate this book if you 're you will love it if you 're sitting on the fence you 're in for a rough ride i 've never read anything like this book the pugnacious fallaci picks you right up out of the crowd and drops you in the center of the ring where the fight is taking place her emotionally charged first person style draws you into her mind heart and soul you soon feel you are fighting for your very life right alongside her it 's been years since i 've read a book i just could n't put down had to take a brief break for some pressing concerns and grabbed the book up again as soon as possible another stint of intense and exhilarating reading and finally radical islam was left reeling on the ropes winner by a knockout champion of polemical prose oriana fallaci addendum obit blog by david horowitz on his website a great warrior is gone friday september 15 2006 am oriana fallaci has died after a long struggle with cancer at the age of her last years were spent in the united states in part because she was hunted in her own beloved italy because of her war against the islamic jihad a fatwa calling for death was issued an islamic jihadist an italian judge attempted to put her in jail for offending the invaders she found refuge in the united states but she also embraced america as her homeland in exile because she understood that america was the global center of resistance to the islamic threat the attacks of inspired her from her sick bed she wrote two polemics the rage and the pride and the force of reason which are clarion calls to action to defend the west if we prevail in this battle to defend our civilization they will be remembered in the same way that tom paine 's common sense is remembered as a summons to americans to defend their freedom orianna fallaci was a woman of unbelievable courage we will not see her like again soon may we honor her by heeding her warnings and dedicating ourselves to the struggle to which she gave her final hours ''
this is fallaci 's forceful reason against the rising and insidious spread of radical islam into europe which she refers to as eurabia does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is are europe 's leaders especially in her native italy biased towards muslim sympathies in opposition to christian values an argument not likely to be considered by muslims or their leaders though the muslim side should take note that 1. opposing and contrary views are inherent to the western tradition and 2. many in the west remain skeptical about muslim claims to be a religion of peace while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to that women are accorded merely partial human rights depending on the degree of fundamentalist view and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social grievances ''
very informative and scary ms fallaci offers firsthand observances of what 's going on and what we may expect if we do n't wake up scary to read about a minority group within a country browbeating the citizens to do just as they want if the do n't develop spines we 'll all be in trouble am waiting for fallaci 's next book

being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen i was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor this book is a great read and certainly we need to understand human nature and include it in our understanding of our history and ourselves today mcelvaine makes a good first stab at this and i will not repeat his argument again but point out a few important errors the faults with the book concern the biology both the factual errors and the lack of real exploration the descriptions of the mating behavior of primates are not fully correct especially regarding gorillas the silverback has a very small penis and testicles and little interest in sex except when a female is ovulating which means at intervals of three to four years hardly comparable to humans mcelvaine also says that animals rarely kill members of their own species but dian fossey stated that 25 of gorilla mortality was due to the male gorilla he kills both other males and infants if he ousts a resident male the biggest error is that apes are in fact not matrilineal in chimpanzees and bonobos the males remain for life in their natal group and the females leave at puberty this is most likely the case for hominids and humans ie human females have hardly ever been matilineal and had the benefit of this base for kin or bonding mcelvaine makes a big case for human 'mounting ' behavior which may be valid but amongst other primate species there is no universal evidence for it correlating directly with dominance and submission sometimes the dominant individual is mounted sometimes females mount their female 'friends ' sometimes a presentation is a way to give an olfactory signal by a dominant also presentations that are submissive are very different from the upright assertive stance of a female soliciting a copulation these errors do not greatly undermine any of the arguments but do show that when we are going to use biology in an argument we need to know more than just a little biology the fact that human males have nearly always spent their whole life with kin when females have had to join a new group to breed is an enormously important factor in the repression of human females and the dominance of men and masculine values including men fighting over possession of such females looking at primate behavior tends to show that the roots of some of our behavior were very deep and strong well before agriculture came along also even if we do think more about the spectrum of human nature there may well be a number of males at the masculine end of the spectrum who are not striving to be anything other than they naturally are ie are extreme males who simply have little or no capacity for feminine values if these are the dangerous males then the best we can do is to stop allowing them and their virtual 100 masculinity to be the role models for the more average male or even the average human mcelvaine 's points about the false metaphors we use language and attitudes misogyny a male creator the belittling of feminine values and behaviors and the impossible way men try to be 'notawoman ' are certainly strong and in many ways obvious when pointed out and it is surely foolish to think that such a species can hope for anything other than toppling over in the mightiest of falls mcelvaine offers a few ideas about how we might be able to overcome our maladaptive proclivities but it is an enormous task both to recognize our human errors and for men to ever overcome their maladaptive inheritance and genuinely not feel so much contempt for the feminine in human nature it is hard to imagine the necessary changes coming any time soon a highly recommended read and hopefully it will open up essential further explorations in this area
i liked this book it definitely gets you thinking about things differently i found it very interesting to look at how society and culture changed including the dynamics between women and men as a result of or coinciding with the onset of agriculture i would also highly recommend the book guns germs and steel for a look at how society evolves and changes in response to similarities and differences in climate population technology both these books offer very interesting perspectives not hum drum at all
this book has been especially useful for a university paper i was working on it passed some time since that but the concepts i read are still fresh in my memory since it were concepts i 've been suspicious for a long time one might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male impotence '' but if you take an impartial look you 'll find he is right do n't get me wrong i have no problems in beeing a man but i 'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman that he is not a sissy or a gay wich is even worse but on the contrary that he is a real macho a sex machine that can score '' as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence it 's sad but it 's the reality fortunately things are changing in spain we had notice of the first girl she 's 16 that joined a senior male soccer team as an advancee in germany angela merkel is the first woman to be nominated chancelor in the great majority of western countries the armed forces do accept equally male and female recruits it reminds me the movie of 007 goldeneye '' when the admiral said to m a woman that she did n't had the balls '' to stand in face of the situation to wich she replied that she had the advantage of not having to be thinking with them all the time it would be nice if in the future our leaders will think less with the balls '' and more with the
this is the book i 've been looking for it explains the world we 're living in right now and where we 've been this book really gets to the root of the basic problem men ar n't able to be men because we 're afraid of our femininity so we 're and we 're so angry at being that we take it out on women we blame them for it that 's it in a nutshell and it all started thousands of years ago with the agricultural revolution when we lost our place in society we were out of a job and we 've been playing ever since and still are today it 's still going on note i 'm writing this on the day of the insane war we 're waging on iraq after reading this book you 'll understand why these insecure infantile itiots mask their impotence by waging war we are at this moment witnessing the catastrophic consequences of the that he talks about as long as we define man as '' we 're stuck
after reading an editorial in the washington post written by this author concerning the taliban 's treatment of women i had to read this book this is truly an important and timely book that touches on everything that vexes our society today women 's rights where men fit into the modern society racism and how religion has played an unfortunate part in keeping women down and that 's just the tip of the iceberg it is a dense and challenging but worthwhile read and when you get your copy pass it around it should be shared ps someone should tell bill maher about this one it 's right up his alley

how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told this book was a read for me not because i could n't put it down but because i felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing i ca n't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and i frequently felt sick reading it but truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it i 'm glad i did i was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive which was no easy feat
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
one of the things i love about james patterson 's books is his prose it 's a no frills i am what i am '' voice that does n't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language in judge jury the story is written from a perspective that of fbi senior agent nick pellisante for years nick has been on the trail of a powerful mafia don named dominic cavello and his efforts are about to pay off nick trails cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him the story picks up the pace after andie is introduced as one of the jurors selected for the court case against cavello andie is a single mom and an actress who is trying to make ends meet with acting jobs that her agent can get for her the suspense heats up when cavello 's people hires a assassin to help him get out of jail the assassin is successful and what follows is a devastating tragedy that forever changes the lives of those involved cavello 's ruthlessness however puts him squarely in the path of an enraged mother who will stop at nothing to get her revenge judge jury is an easy read but also very entertaining you 'll not be disappointed
great book one of patterson 's best i had a hard time putting it down once i started on it combined some of the legal ease of john grisham really enjoyed reading this book
oh this was a grabber nothing 's missing in this thrill a minute saga which has been voted the book i most enjoyed while staying in barbara 's guest room '' two guests now have been up all night reading judge and jury '' it 's featured prominently on my guest room book shelf with a strong recommendation that if they want to read a good yarn this is it although everyone reports favorably on the book it does make for some pretty siteseeing the next day i loved the premise of this one felt i knew the characters and i thoroughly enjoyed the trip to ushuaia i never knew what the end of the world was like but now i feel i 've been there as a writer myself i marvel at james patterson 's output i guess if he experiences writer 's block he just says here andrew you write for a while '' whatever the procedure they hit an ace with this one and what 's really great is that while i 'm still riding the crest of the wave on judge and jury the news reports another new book about to be launched cross '' i ca n't wait !
once again james patterson has us on the edge of our seats in another he has created a brand new villain equally as detestable as gary soneji in the persona of mob boss dominic cavello when nicholas pellisante nicky smiles joins forces with the sole survivor of a bus carrying the jurors for cavello 's trial which has been bombed by one of cavello 's guns for hire to catch the escaped cavello the reader is in for the ride of a lifetime
if you 've read other patterson mysteries and enjoyed them you 'll like this one too there are no real surprises this novel trods the mystery formula but does so entertainingly yes there are legal bloopers but people do n't read novels like this to learn the law if you have n't read any patterson you 'll probably like this if you like john grisham for instance these are novels with not too much description or fine character development if you like law order you 'll probably like this too
i enjoyed the book i like the suspense the connection with the characters i enjoyed james patterson suspense novels in the way he writes them and how the characters have their own identity and pesonaility
this book like most all of james patterson 's books kept me on the edge of my seat ! i could n't put it down
an engrossing story well written with twists and turns that make the reader want to turn the page or start the next chapter i personally found judge jury '' a more rewarding read than beach road ''
as judge jury i would highly recommend this book patterson ca n't write a bad book but this is one of his best
the watcher and other stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories i personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing the watcher deals with our protagonist watching '' the voting procedures in a home for the home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of italian society smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution the argentine ants is a type of mock horror story all of the above are extremely well written and executed although i did enjoy this book i would suggest that readers unfamiliar with calvino try some of his masterpieces first and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these
grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time arkansas the events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young luke chandler the author creates much the same feel that you get from rawling 's the yearling though this is not really a story as you sit on the porch listening to the cardinals baseball game on the radio you become one of the family in this book you hear the local gossip worry about the uncle in korea and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop the relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant mexican workers the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks i 'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of luke
while reading a painted house i had to keep reminding myself that this was a grisham book ! ! it honestly was not like anything else of his that i 've read and i was happily surprised the story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton is one that sweeps you up almost immediately the characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you 're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him in the meantime he 's growing up a bit too fast the conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story i 'd definitely recommend this book to someone especially grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law
john steinbeck is one of my favorite authors the grapes of wrath east of eden grisham has managed to capture steinbeck 's style and weave a tale that captures the reader right from the first paragraph ! luke is a 7 year old farm boy who dreams of leaving the farm and playing baseball for the louis cardinals his family are cotton farmers and every summer they hire a group of hill '' people and mexican migrants to help them pick the year 's cotton crop the work is grueling long hours in the hot sun and luke must pitch in the only respite luke gets is a trip to town on saturday afternoons where he can get a coke and see a movie usually a gene autry western or something along that genre what happens is that the group hired has a scary dangerous man hank who loves to beat up and maim people a young girl named talley who likes to charm young luke and a simple minded boy i forgot his name who decides that he will paint luke 's house it has never been painted in 50 years and thus the title of the book comes from this luke is exposed to a good deal of secrets two murders and the knowledge that his brother who is away fighting in korea may have gotton a neighboring 15 year old pregnant the writing is superb and it excellently captures a forgotten time life on a farm in the early 50 's i liked this book better than grisham 's courtroom dramas and i hope he has some more of these type of novels up his sleeve
i really enjoyed this book and not being a grisham fan at all this is really saying something i do n't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading a painted house by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found and right he was this story was touching and it was enjoyable along the same lines as to kill a mockingbird the only courtroom story i 've ever enjoyed in its background and overall feel i did n't like the ending not because it was n't good and not because it did n't flow with the rest of the book a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together but because it 's not the way i wished it would go a great book and highly recommendable
a painted house is a truely refreshing departure from the typical grisham novel i do believe twain would have been pleased sp may parallels not the least of which is the painting not since the client another grisham favorite has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist like some reviews i found it hard to imagine that luke was a i think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does but the atmosphere painted by grisham draws the reader right into the backwater arkansas area in the hot humid fields humorous touching and above all riveting
fast pace and at times intense kept my interest through the entire book
one of those very lovely coming of age stories this was truly an enjoyable book it has been 4 or 5 years since i have read it and the characters and unforgettable scenes still linger in my head grisham steps out of the box and encircles a world of writing that i would like to see more of from him this story is supposed to be loosely based on his own upbringing and the passion and honesty of his experiences are transposed into an adventurous tale i agree with the other reviewer that the boy should n't have been 7 years old and more like 10 or 11 i have 4 boys myself i think this is the only weak spot in the story it just is n't convincing enough to me that he is that young especially in 1952 when a 7 year old was truly a 7 year old
i realize this is an old title i 've not had a chance to get to all of the back list i only first read hiaasen a couple years ago anyway hiaasen is a writer pure and simple but he also has a good idea of what goes on in the human mind and behind closed doors that kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well but he pulls it off and i 've enjoyed the several titles i 've had a chance to read this one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government while the story centers around a stripper it is really a story about corruption and politics in any case if you have n't had a chance to check out this author this is a good a place as any i suppose and i give this one a strong recommendation
the mystery of why every single carl hiaasen book has n't been made into a movie has finally been solved suffice it to say that hiaasen should be allowed to slap demi moore until her head falls off and his readers should have the right to go skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was strip tease '' the movie unbeknownst to stripper erin grant she is at the center of a big the night one drunk beats up another with a champagne bottle while she 's onstage the bottle wielder is none other than us congressman david dilbeck who heads the committee that keeps sugar prices artificially high and ensuring fat profits for corporate sugar farmers who in turn pay their workers disgustingly low wages dilbeck is recognized by one customer who is so infatuated with erin he offers to blackmail the congressman into helping her get custody of her daughter which she lost in the divorce because of the job she had to take in order to pay her attorney fees when the customer disappears his body later found by florida detective al garcia while on vacation in montana garcia links the death to a missing attorney and his cousin who happened to be the fiance of the man who was bludgeoned by dilbeck with the champagne bottle at the same time the bouncer at erin 's strip club the eager beaver had been attempting to earn a huge settlement by planting a roach in a carton of yogurt his attorney happened to be the same one who went missing erin 's ex also goes off the deep end his drug habit and wheelchair stealing getting out of control as he gets closer and closer to losing it there 's quite a cast of characters between the bigshots behind the scenes keeping dilbeck 's career on track to the cast of dancers and crooked managers of both the eager beaver and its rival club the flesh farm it 's great entertainment all the way which just makes me wonder how the unskilled moron who hacked this book into a screenplay managed to miss it all and come up with the script that made it to the big screen maybe i was a little prejudiced because of that awful excuse for a movie but it took me a few chapters to really get into this book erin was a bit much of a powerless victim at the beginning but once she gets mad enough to start taking some drastic action things get going and this wound up being one of my favorite hiaasen novels it 's got everything we expect from him a convoluted plot full of characters and plenty of laughs it even managed to overcome the stigma of sharing a title with the worst movie i have ever seen
hiaasen and dave barry in the same office how did anything ever get done at the miami herald another in a series of entertaining off beat adventures where the quasi good guy '' triumphs over an insensitive self absorbed environmentally destructive no
i just finished reading strip tease by carl hiaasen i found his writing to be typical hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected sarcastic and witty in this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past in this book his protagonist is a young woman erin who loses her job at the fbi because of her husbands felonious past she then loses her daughter when her husbands past is hidden by the very people sworn to protect her when he is 'hired ' as a confidential informant erin ends up turning to exotic dancing as it is the only way for her to make the money she needs to fight for her daughters ' custody i found this commentary on society in particular our views on women 's jobs and pay to very poignant the only way erin can make thousands of dollars is to expose herself to the very men who are judging her to be an unfit mother following the theme of previous hiaasen novels the antagonists are corrupt and oblivious to the harm they cause to both the environment and their constituents the descriptions of the misconduct is both intriguing and scary hiaasen continues to impress with his sarcastic and witty style if dark humor is what you fancy you wo n't be dissapointed in this outing from one of the best writers in the genre
i would give it an 11 if i could this book is flawless from the first page i was hooked the characters were the best i had ever read in a novel hiaasen 's humor was found myself laughing often even though the movie did n't cover as much ground as the book i think the movie was much better than most people have let on read this will love it i have gone through 3 copies i 've read it so much
great book easy to read perfect for the beginner cook spiral bound so it 's easy to fold the pages back would be nice to have some sort of menu planner for example buy the ingredients for one dinner and some of those can be used the next day for lunch or another dinner so i dont have a box of 11 eggs left over i could dig and find another recipe that calls for eggs too but i 'm a begginer cook i need someone to point me to the next recipe
this book is a good cookbook for poor mac and cheese eating college students the receipes are easy to follow and cheap to make the only thing i did n't like about it was that is was too short more receipes please
as jean patterson 's sister i was the target audience for this book since i was a college student with little to no experience in the kitchen i needed help scrambled eggs were a nightmare and macaroni and cheese from the box was as good as got after testing recipes that my sister sent me i discovered that the directions were not only easy to follow but the results were incredible my brownies have even been praised as the best ever tasted yes even better than grandma 's i find with this book i am eating much healthier and saving money as well this book did wonders plus it makes a great gift for students !
these recipes are quite simple and perhaps someone who is an experienced chef might not like them but i am a singleton who works 60 hours per week and this book is full of quick dinners and more importantly stuff that i can make and take to work to reheat for lunch
i do n't know about college students but i do know that i 'm not sure how i 've made it 33 years in life without this book the great thing about this cookbook is the meals do n't take 5 hours to prepare and it 's all very simple almost as fast and easy as calling up the pizza delivery guy and a helluva lot healthier i even impressed my new fiance
i wish somebody had given this book to me when i left the nest it covers all the basics and would have saved me a lot of calls to mom everything is organized so well with what you need listed at the top of the page and careful instructions below the spiral cover makes it easy to set it down on the countertop and not worry about it flipping over to another page the perfect gift for a graduate
if it was n't for this book i would have starved
interesting and insightful however it can occasionally lack clarity lose the thread of what is being said even so this is well worth snapping up for a summer read especially so if you have not read this kind of stuff before
to paraphrase from preface 's the famous noam chomsky 's a personal hero suggestion regarding our ignorance we do not have any idea how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved i have read this book the year it first came out 1997 and many times over since should one still belive that thoughts feelings beliefs meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we i mean any take for granted every day i use my mind every day my wife and might want to argue otherwise but they are wrong ! i do think on a daily yet i do n't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain is the 17 th century french philiospher rene descart right when he proclaimed i think therefore i am '' what insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since descart 's time another words do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind pinker now at harvard and a gaint in this field do not have the answers as a matter of fact he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true however he has painted an overall picture on the research on cognition oh the book it has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried i think and hope to tickle readers ' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs for example under the standard equipment chapter rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind he used the working definition of intlliegence ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one 's action to reach that point to illustrate that we use our desires ie the latest big screen sony tv and use our beliefs ie if i work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income to increase the chance of achieving that result watching the final four basketball games on sony big screen tv yet is this stimluli vivid and beautiful live college hoops on tv and response working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input do we endlessly shop for junks we can not possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere response to stimuli what about the level of the brain can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work from page 99 pinker stated from the mathematicians warren mcculloch and walter pitts that neurons have one purpose in life add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded '' are you joking me with a description like this it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks that might be more important than any single cell another words perhaps thoghts ideas imagination emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these supercomputer '' networking this conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless what about complexity itself can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival it is beyond imagination of my limited mind no pun intended that perhaps i do n't have adequate brain power to understand my mind so why should i or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way a mental life is the result of my mind and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings why can i be peaceful and happy like i want to be every time i am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in los angeles pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish he only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas i keep this book close to me at an arm 's reach every time my mind fails me more frequent than i like now days and i am only 36 years old and i it over and over for its shear beauty audacity and clarity unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one 's mind
have you been amazed by the things your body can do and probably can not do like the great stereo vision the spatial hearing capability the ease at which we multiple languages how does our brain achieve all this how does our brain stores and incorporates new information where do human emotions come from what is the reason behind anger fear and other multitudes of human emotions what is this thing called consciousness what is the reason behind the peculiar male female behaviour what makes our ties to blood relations so strong why we find enjoyment in art what is life why do we exist i personally have been intrigued by these and more of these questions most of the time we relegate answers to these questions to some divine entity and many of them we just take for granted however this is one of the books that attempts to answer or shares insights to answers to some of these questions in short this book is going to blow your mind away literally figuratively this book not only tries to enlighten us but also makes us ask more questions about our own existence in general author contends that the evolution process contributed towards the development of different faculties in affect we own most of our cool faculties to survival instinct of our genes the author a great scientist provides some interesting evidences to support his thinking one thing i liked about this book is that it is written in a very simple and easy to comprehend language it avoids references to tongue twisting weird words like myelography parietal occipital another thing i liked about this book is that it conveys lots of nice via the means of references to interesting anecdotes from calvin and hobbes godfather and like all in all this is a must must read it is going to leave your !
as a layman even athough i was trained as an engineer i was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book especially after i have read most of the editorial readers ' reviews on the net i was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author his book my decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick over 600 pages the apparent level of complexity judging from my random test however my deep personal interest in understanding brain science the curiosity streak in me finally drove me to buy the book the first half was quite an easy ride for me as the author offered a general model to explain how why the mind works the way it does this is despite the fact that the writing was dry monotonous in most areas witty crisp in some areas cram packed with seemingly irrelevant information the second half was a tough ride for me as the author touched on the implications of social behaviours frankly i am not disappointed by the book even though i am still puzzled by some parts of the book my own personal assessment of the book is that it is an intellectual smorgasbord of disparate scientific natural selection artificial intelligence neural networks economics biology anthropology philosophy psychology family values feminism emotions etc which probably make my reading somewhat difficult especially towards the second half of the book at the end i have really enjoyed reading this book particularly in terms of what i am looking for in the first place i also like the author 's extensive notes and large reading lists the most productive learning experience for me is a better understanding may be i should say another perspective of visual perception in fact in chapter 4 the author has dedicated an almost entire chapter from page 214 to 242 to the perception of sterograms or visual illusions as far as i know this is the only brain book after discounting bela julesz 's book that i have come across that touches on this wonderful topic which also happens to be one of my pet subjects on the whole from my personal perspective this somewhat wonderful book definitely gives a reasonably good coverage on the intricacies idiosyncracies of the human mind in spite of what the author had admitted in the preface first we do n't understand how the mind works ''
after becoming thoroughly jaded by the 'standard social science model ' and the brow beating of religion this book was a near epiphany for myself the writing is crisp witty lucid and provocative i contented myself with how he substantiated his research albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior i 'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized but the genie is out of the bottle now and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book pinker will bring you under this compulsion if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry dare to read dare to change dare to think for some pinker will open up a 'pandora 's box ' but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well this read will stike you like dorothy stepping into color for the first time this book is now permanently shelved for future reference which is very telling because i simply ca n't say that about the vast majority of material i 've read to this date
i first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection from being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last i had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense the natural world human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole so the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and family values rather than the workings of the human mind though these sections are also a very good read having read widely since i know there is far more that needs to be understood particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women like myself who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male also with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating and not necessarily with only one male it is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father in other species though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them which naturally overrides female mate choice he is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another in this book pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'the blank slate ' when he writes about rape though i now know enough to be able to question points in this book i still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone

when thoroughly digested and fully comprehended the principles and their practical application of james allen 's classic will change your life and more importantly the way you think about it instantaneously
the idea in the book is known to most of us yet we do n't realize how much impact it has on our life i wish i read this book when i was a teenager it might have changed the course of my life for better but it is never too late the ideas in this book make you take charge of your life inspires you to steer your own ship of life it is truly life changing book i ordered the audio cd the begining was a bit confusing but after i got used to their style i started to comprehend it
1. discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you a man thinketh ' by james allen encompasses the idea that all that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts '' james allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that in a justly ordered universe where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction individual responsibility must be absolute a man 's weakness and strength purity and impurity are his own and not another man 's '' before reading the book i was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience i have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to though i was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create after reading this book i felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective i felt as though i had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture a world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance i could begin to experiment to see just what exactly i can create this same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself as each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results '' mentally reviewing past experiences i can see and understand the correlation between thoughts i had chosen to entertain and my circumstances looking at my present situation i can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality i see before me at an ever increasing pace i am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present my future and my past the more i practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way until thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment with the majority the bark of thought is allowed to drift '' upon the ocean of life aimlessness is a vice and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction reading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody if there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created 2. can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships your beliefs your goals your values etc explain since reading as a man thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me as i can to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society i believe this would push us all in a more positive direction i can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box if our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking if we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality and even learn to positively influence reality then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking my goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision i see of a world that works for everybody into a reality reading a man thinketh ' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet which is that there is no such thing as chance looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined i do however think we every situation in our lives through our thinking our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we do n't pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the ' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience realizing i have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life the idea to me makes life in my mind fair at least for the experiences i can vouch for when i read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and i had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences about three years ago just before i left england i fell out with my best friend huw who i had been friends with for ten years one weekend in the summer of after i had just come back from a holiday with huw and some of our other friends in the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place the crux of the story is that huw decided to take somebody else 's word over mine with regards to a then recent situation the information huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being at first the situation seemed like a chance happening and i was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about having arisen from decisions based on what i knew to be a fabrication i felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary i really did n't understand how such a situation could have come about could it be that sometimes life was unfair for days i was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts searching for the cause of the situation i started with thinking that the person who had lied to huw was to blame and that huw had had issues anyway i came to various conclusions however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over this stirred more confusion in me as it was something i did not wish to believe after really stepping out of the picture leaving the country for cambodia which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life and then thinking about my relationship with huw retrospectively i came to see that just as 'circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself ' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship i asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant if i had been a good enough friend to huw then trust would have gone without question i had lost the trust and faith of a friend the deterioration of my relationship with huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where i was forced to pay attention the situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important it was n't anything to do with one situation i had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues i should have paid attention to until finally it was right in my face and i had to pay attention a man does not come to the or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires nor does a man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power circumstance does not make the man it reveals him to himself no such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations and man therefore as the lord and master of thought is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity its strength and weakness 3. what are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book please explain one of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances after reading as a man thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it 's supposed to indeed quite perfectly and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules james allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way if there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer my understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow it is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another i believe we all have what i can at best describe as a magical force inside us ever seen starwars i feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force or whether it controls us where does cancer come from i think we create it i think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to and through our neglect of certain areas of our life that we cause such a thing as cancer and indeed everything else to manifest we all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse i think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness i think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world all the conflicts of the world or the cancers of the world so to speak take for example the conflict in iraq or the israeli situation the problems in south asia i believe it 's all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us we are in control you me everybody and we all have blood on our hands paul sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become there is no fixed human nature no predestination no god that determines our course and we suffer because we can not handle this burden the power to think feel express believe will do and progress is from the start all within our hands this is an extremely dangerous distribution of power and on some level we all know it as a result most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to that responsibility and we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity life in orthodoxy is comfortable familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency we sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment the world around us is an extension of the world inside of us when we do wrong we are only doing it to ourselves i think our whole world has got cancer and it could even look as thought it 's dying although i hope its getting better if you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it thinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully ever since reading as a man thinketh i 've been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality i think as a man thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race the more i think about it the more it makes sense 4. has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way if so explain how this book has entirely changed my thinking and now i look at life from a totally different standpoint one where i can see how i am in complete control of my circumstances now when i look at seemingly problematic situations i ask myself why and how i have created the situation and i ask what can be learned from the situation reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended i think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened if we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us no matter what they are i now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts i allow myself to entertain oftentimes i am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from but now when i find myself thinking something less than constructive i stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling he who cherishes a beautiful vision a lofty ideal in his heart will one day realize it
this book is a quick read on how your thoughts determine your life it is shocking and hard for people to believe but your thoughts are the power that creates your inner and outer book shows how your thoughts cause your character circumstances health purpose ideals and level of achievement start with this book to learn how to control your thoughts and create your life
the concepts are not new and hardly there are no new ideas in this book mr allan was just the first to present them is all james allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book he states in the book he who would accomplish little must sacrifice little he who would achieve much must sacrifice much he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly '' effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book james allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure
okay it 's a collection of far side comics which is what i want so it 's awesome for that reason but the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing first all the comics are black and white yeah it 's not about the art and you do n't miss much without color but come on would a little color kill anyone especially ones that were originally color second it 's pretty thin on strips with 4 to a page most of the time a good amount sometimes 2 on a page and even occassionally one comic on a single page ! it looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page
some of my earliest memories are filled with reading the far side on my father 's lap after the evening meal whenever i asked my parents for a one of the standard collections they told me to wait one day they would all be in one book then for christmas one year i got this book what can i say but thank you mom and dad and thank you larson ! the far side was and still is funny original and timeless this collection gives you some of the best of the original strips and lends itself well to watching the progression of humor up and through until the end
gary larson never ceases to amaze me i 've been a religious follower of the far side for as long as i can remember i love the way he looks at the lighter side of life yet some of the comics really hit home my favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark ! go larry you 're my super hero
lol ! ! ! ! this is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick in a good way mind the far side is timeless i laugh every time i read them and that 's a good thing
how gary larson keeps coming up with this stuff i have no idea it seems like the more i read the more i begin to laugh this particular gallery is totally hilarious if you do n't get the humor in the far side '' my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books in fact i heard the current president has n't got a far side chuckle since 1991
the far side is my favorite comic out of all it is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard larson 's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on comparing the picture to the caption and it is hysterical there are scizophrenic kangaroos plane driving sheep duck relays and pretty much any other twisted idea out there any far side book is one that will never fail to please
sick absurd humor is larson 's specialty and in this collection larson is at his best many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species where animals get their revenge on humans others are based on themes from popular culture such as tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling kemosabe that the music is starting they are funny but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram if you are a fan of larson 's unique brand of humor then you will love this collection
why not write a cartoon book that does n't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next ! '' that must have been similar to what gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books every joke is truly different from the next one ! and every joke is refreshingly original ! each joke comes from a thoughtful clever and of course playful mind
i do n't know how the guy does it they keep getting funnier and there are always ones i 've never seen before as well as the ones i 've always loved you wo n't be disappointed if you are a far side fan if you 're not a far side fan well then i ca n't help you
when i started work at my present job almost two years ago i found that the place needed a little 'lightening up ' it was casual already to some extent so on my next 'office supply ' shopping 'trip ' i picked up this calendar for my desk well it began a new office ritual everyone wants to know the '' ! sometimes it 's the only funny thing to happen all day larson needs to come out of retirement
intriguing as always exciting from the first page strong for the first and less editorializing '' than usual but it 's just not as good as his higher concept novels but it 's still very enjoyable all the way through and as always makes you think it feels a little dated now but i it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time sphere should definitely be a part of any crichton fan 's library skip the movie though here the science is less convincing '' than in jurrassic park which is mostly convincing but stretched and prey which is better writing and fun but not convincing but that does n't matter because crichton can write an adventure like few others as long as character is n't important character 's here take backseat to concept and science pace as always is good more a rollicking adventure than something to think about '' typical of later novels and quite enjoyable on that level it 's the kind of novel you 'll tear through in a weekend at most and that 's a good thing
this is my favorite book by crichton i have read every book by him that i can find i just found the plot to be very suspenseful and granted i am 15 so maybe my knowledge of literature is not as high as some adults but this is a great read !
sphere by michael crichton is an excellant novel this was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the crichton novels that i have read the story revolves around a man named norman johnson johnson is a phycologist he travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the pacific ocean to help the navy in a top secret misssion they quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship the civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft they are joined by 5 navy personel to help them run operations however on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave the team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean after a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an american ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth this novel does not have the research that some of the other crichton novels have but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis i would strongly recommend this book
this is one of the most enjoyable books i have ever read it turned me into a crichton fanatic i have since read all of his books he creates suspense like no one else forget the movie is notorious for ending chapters with such a cliffhanger you feel compelled to read on
i 'm amazed at how diverse a writer michael crichton is i really liked the concept of this book man builds a spaceship in the future to leap across space and gather data it returns back to earth in the past due to an error the spaceship not only creates a paradox it also brings something back from its distant journey great story
i am satified with the servic
i am pleasantly surprised by the readability of this useful book the book kept my attention and it was very helpful and informative
bryan garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing legal writing in plain english '' contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney some of these are obvious use a readable typeface while others are more nuanced delete perhaps the legal drafter 's favorite legalism provided that '' each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal be a good writer so that your reader does n't have to work so darn hard to understand you as everyone knows a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief these exercises range from basic '' to advanced '' and are well worth the time after reading this book and attending garner 's seminar i submit that this book should be required reading for every and associate
bryan garner is leading what might be a quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear clean unambiguous and even interesting prose this book is a recent addition to the garner arsenal which includes the excellent the winning brief and a dictionary of modern legal usage the anonymous writer from new york who slams garner is wrong he claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges who ultimately have to interpret it if the writing were clear to begin with the parties would n't get to a judge they 'd likely settle and that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands perhaps millions of legal decisions over contract disputes almost all arising from documents that were traditionally drafted '' and different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause that writer askes rhetorically whether garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople the rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language legal writing is written in english the same english used to buy groceries talk lovingly to your spouse and complain to the doctor about what ails you there is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson other than lawyers ' need to feel like they 're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana and the writer 's praise of notwithstanding anything to the contrary '' as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement despite anything in this agreement to the contrary '' garner is a brilliant insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use we know what happens with legalese litigation and contention and noncomprehension give plain english a try with garner as your guide to aquinas 's trinity of wholeness harmony radiance and of course clarity clarity clarity
excellent book also modern legal usage edition enough said
yikes ! there is no longer anywhere to hide and there are no more excuses this book shows you how to drop the jargon the gobbledygook the archaisms and the fluff so your writing is exposed now you must think and write clearly and legal writing in plain english will help lawyers and law students have needed this book for a long time it 's superb from back cover
typical danielle steel fluff but one of her better books a little of everything love betrayal tragedy and hope
what i love most about danielle steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character and this one is no different she has had in my opinion some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her
i usually do n't even browse through a ds book for some reason i bought and read this one i could n't put it down could hardly stand to take a break to sleep i did cheer for deanna ben cried my eyes out over pilar even though her character in the book was totally unlovable i did get frustrated in the end with deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting ben about the baby the visual descriptions make you feel like you 're really there i liked the fact that danielle and ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and did n't play games about their feelings the ending is a let down though the epilogue should have been set a few years down the road i loved it when marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the ending would reccomend
i loved this story ! ! ! the action is and the romance sizzles ! buy this one a nd then buy a few copies for friends they will be glad you did ! !
i enjoyed this book very much i 'm surprised that this one was n't made into a once in a lifetime the ring no greater love fine things but i still liked it deanna was very realistic she was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter pilar who died as a result of a motorcycle accident she met ben thompson and found fullfillment with him was already having an affair with a woman named chantal i thought that he was a jerk for doing that to deanna but when it was all said and done and when i finished reading the book deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was ben 's at last she could have a happy life with someone keep up the good work danielle !
i really really hate that she uses the same names in a lot of her books it drives me insane she is always using grace liz dont get me wrong i love danielle steel 's books more that anything but come one can we just get a little insee weensee bit more creative and think of some different names for her books please im sure that other danielle steel readers will feel the same
this is the first danielle steele book i 've read and it will definitely not be my last i really enjoyed reading this book by the time i got to chapter 25 i was wishing that i could read faster because i could n't wait to find out what was going to happen i was torn between 5 and 4 stars i chose 5 stars because it has been 2 weeks since i finished the book and i 'm still thinking about it why i even entertained 4 stars is because the characters committed adultery from the very begining you can tell that this was going to happen and i did n't like that betrayal was involved as i continued to read the book i fell in love with ben it took a while to like deanna because an affair is still an affair but i enventually started to feel for her overall i recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story

whether you like sandy weil or not is not the issue here this is just a fascinating book and one of the best books i have read in a while you will not regret the time that you spend reading this
this book could be considered a corner stone foundation marker in understanding what makes people relevant even when they are not sandy weill shows how consistentcy and planning directed to delivering real value for others will result in producing positive results monica langley describes well how a strong basis in fundamental value wins over adversity and fills in a vacume the book does a good job in reflecting the transition from family to business and the process of creating an icon that sandy weill became with his challenges as a broker american express travelers and citibank as a reader you can see how these companies needed sandy 's pivotal instincts to solve their problems and evolve
as a person used to work in wall street and live now in china i read the chinese version of this book it was as if i lived breathed angered and cheered with weill dimon prince one of the best books about wall street of past 10 years i ordered this book in english and will read it again for at least once
the top business journalists in the world are the ones that research and pen the groundbreaking page stories in the wall street journal the journal breaks these stories over and over again and other news organizations simply trail in their wake monica langley is one of these trailblazers in 'tearing down the walls ' she expands upon a lengthy page profile she had written about sandy weill and details his horatio alger story the title refers to how weill had torn down one wall after another barriers based on religion class even the law to get to where he was '' the cover blurbs refer to this book as 'riveting ' forbes and 'rollicking ' the economist that seems close to impossible for a business book but 'walls ' is a tale of a character you 'll blast through these 438 pages effortlessly it 's also worth noting that based on langley 's reporting chuck prince earned his stripes and was duly rewarded in getting tabbed as weill 's successor and bank one and now chase made a great choice in naming jamie dimon as its ceo dimon leaps off the page as the crown prince of wall street langley is clearly taken with the guy 's obvious charisma and skills dimon seems to have this effect on everyone throughout the course of the book
tearing down the walls '' charts the ascent of citigroup chairman sandy weill from lowly brokerage clerk to master of a financial empire what emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute but also seriously flawed prone to fits of rage weill regularly unleashes streams of expletives on petrified subordinates sometimes reducing them to tears he is quick to punish close lieutenants foolish enough to evince the slightest bit of disloyalty and his focus on tends to sow disaffection among employees but he is also something of an enigma despite his fearsome temper he has a tremendous capacity for empathy often moved to tears upon learning of the plight of others shy and unassertive in his early days he later metamorphoses into a and forceful leader langley is a skilled raconteur and her silken prose is a pleasure to read her ability to glean the finer details of weill 's life is also impressive without a doubt this is one of the best business books of the year
this is a very good book very inspiring langley is successfull in making a very human sandy weill
monica langley follows sandford weill a shy jewish boy from brooklyn through his youthful struggles against adversity his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success seen through the prism of weill 's tumultuous career the financial world is small despite its importance internally more like a village than a city the book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class we recommended langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier 's career into such a compelling narrative

i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer imho it has romance treasure hunting and a little magic great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down read it several years ago the scenery mystery romance all intertwined makes for a great novel
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed maybe because i did not want it to end ! also i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree the water the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read however i am an avid jd robb reader this book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun how exciting ! the plot was wonderful the characters were likable the villians were nasty this is one book that i am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat and i will read it again when the cold starts setting in so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book whether you like romance novels or not
first let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read her stories tend to be very formulaic and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books this one went against convention in many ways while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain but the love story was touching as other readers have said i liked how she spread it out over the years which made it slightly more realistic and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream this is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist tate beaumont and matthew lassiter and their families the families run into each other while for angelique 's curse a treasure that has eluded everyone and many think it is only a myth but this artifact is worth everything to some even worth killing another as this joint expedition continues it holds all of the elements needed for a great story mystery romance secrets that ca n't be shared deceptions and threats there are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader is n't sure which avenue nora roberts will take until she delivers them to it this always keeps you on the edge of your seat and gives you a first hand view '' of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue i highly recommend the reef and only wish it would have continued or at least had a sequel in the works ! great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning one of nora roberts better works !
this book is good but not exactly what i wanted i received these books in excellent condition and in a timely fashion thank you
this update is aces ! the added information on safety came just in time i had just started the l d rotation the quick feature is very helpful ! overall this drug guide is a must for nursing students and licensed nurses
while working as an office rn i am often asked by a patient questions about the new '' medication they are on this book provides the answers it 's easy to read each drug is broken into quick to find sections and it is very do n't practice nursing without this book
this is one of the best drug guides i have found it contains everything you need and then some it also has a handy with tons of information on it
this book is very helpful it has lots of drugs in it and a lot of valuable info for planning patient care and ensuring there are no medication reactions
this excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital pda version of davis 's drug guide for nurses the best drug guide which i have used how many errors could be alleviated if more nurses looked up their meds ! however since on most units medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases the sad fact is that meds are not looked up my first pda drug guide was mosby 's which i have had for over a year i now also own davis 's i can not tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages adverse reactions or nursing considerations more than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result but had i not been in the room the med likely would have been given how nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket searchable by both generic and brand names no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name always accessible so now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a pda drug guide but which one should you buy like i said i have owned mosby 's drug guide for over a year and have just recently purchased davis i have found davis 's drug guide to be more thorough davis is also easier to navigate both davis and mosby have menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the mechanism of action adverse effects compatibility nursing considerations client education etc however since davis has the content divided into more subsections it is quicker to navigate to the desired content so my personal choice is davis however i do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these i only encourage you to move out of the and to the pda version you may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides such as pagana pagana 's diagnostic laboratory test reference isbn 0323033954 or the one included in nursing clinical companion isbn 0323031994 medical dictionaries like taber 's isbn and more i hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice improved patient outcomes and reduced errors http
for the first time i ordered my school texts to save money i am so pleased with the results shipment was fast product was perfect and i saved money great for a forever '' student
you ca n't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide ! it is listed under generic names but if you do n't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name i had a professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all this book delivered it all classification pregnancy catagory indications mechanism of action contraindications and precautions adverse reactions and side effects interactions route and dosage availability nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses ! also implementation teaching and evaluation wow ! i 've been very impressed it came through for me so i did n't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something ! davis 's drug guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including recent drug approvals additional drugs combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that include class indications adverse reactions and side effects route and dosage and contraindications and warnings appendix e is about products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book there are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites formulas helpful for calculating doses routine pediatric and adult immunizations recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs schedules of controlled substances food sources for specific nutrients ie foods rich in k na ca fe vit k vit d low na foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine and insulin and insulin therapy also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past the organized easily found references in this guide could save your client 's lives just because a doctor orders it does n't mean it is ok to give as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all ! highly recommended ! good luck all future nurses ! soar !
the book i received was in good condition it had a minor crease on the cover were it had been opened overall i would buy from this seller again
i got this book when i started nursing school in 2003. this year fall 2005 as a senior i wanted to get an updated drug guide so i asked my adult ii instructor what she recommended and purchased it it was from another company and was in shrink wrap so i did not look at it before i purchased the company is very reputable but i found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as davis 's that was 35 down the tubes ! i would like to see a newer editon of davis 's that covers the many new drugs as soon as i do i will purchase
bill rancic the dashing winner of the first season of donald trump 's reality show the apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book you 're hired how to succeed in business and life that he never went to business school and that he does n't believe that business theory can be learned from a book what then is the affable rancic doing offering advice on good and ethical business practices making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame that 's what in two hundred pages he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out applicants to become the donald 's first ' the reader is privy to rancic 's early entrepreneurial efforts businesses that whet his appetite for something larger readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition through it all rancic recounts the lessons he 's learned persons he 's admired falls from which he 's risen he offers opinions on kwame jackson his fellow to the apprentice title and ' omarosa whom many believed was the cause of jackson 's loss he also details lessons he 's learned on goals values strategies leadership vision and success while business school grads may scoff at rancic 's and simplistic advice it is less idealistic than the one minute manager series of books here rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams the result is one that is as memorable yet as pleasing as a tall glass of lemonade
this is not the type of book i usually read but the persona that came through was so engaging that after flipping through a few pages i decided to buy the book rancic personifies the american ideal wholesome grounded in a loving family that emphasizes hard work and integrity and genetically blessed in the looks department ! this fortuitous mix of apple pie '' ingrediants have garnered him national fame and this book outlines his experiences along with the lessons he learnt along the way that propelled him to be the apprentice the accounts of his experiences are modern day fables with the moral of the story encapsulated as life lessons at the end of each chapter in addition each chapter contains vignettes of wisdom boxed in grey shading many of these are commonsense admonitions we 've been hearing all our lives to the point that they have become cliches rancic shows that these tried and true maxims of the american dream still apply i gave the book four stars for two reasons one the editing is sloppy writing a book in a conversational tone does not override the need for proper grammar two rancic 's references to himself sometimes tend to sound smarmy as when he refers to himself as master chef '' in the pancake story from his childhood and later when he calls himself an eligible bachelor this takes away from his as humble such relatively minor flaws aside this is a book worth reading
while lots of books give you high level theories on how to succeed in your business they usually leave you hanging at the end of the reading not know what actions to take in order to apply the theories in your operation rancic 's book however has a recount of how he did it with his cigar business you will get specific actions that you can do tomorrow to generate sales while other books give you general directions and lots of bullsh ts rancic tells you specifically what he had done to succeed his business what radio station he called how much he paids for what 's the account was how much he charged if you are an entrepreneur starting out or already struggling with your size business this book is your road map
if you are looking for a book filled with tactics and ideas this is not it move along if you are looking for an inspirational addition to your business collection then this should be yours personally i loved this book and read it in one sitting it profiles rancic demonstrating the obstacles he has overturned on his road to success you 're hired '' shows what can be and motivates one to achieve
from the moment i picked up this book and started reading it i could not put it down ! literally thank goodness my toddler was still sleeping in the early morning hours which allowed me to do so bill talks about how he was brought up and how is entreprenral mind was formed it was a very interesting and inspiring read if you are thinking about going into business for yourself read this book it confirms the fact that if you do not go for it it will never happen bill took his dreams and ideas and turned them into reality
i really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series if you are a fan of dean koontz you will not be disappointed i give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in but well worth the wait whew what a ride
this character is a very unlikely hero a total geek who is absolutley story fast paced and well was my first koontz book and it will not be my last i 'm actually reading forever odd '' and that too is very this book
for me this was one of starters of dean koontz 's books i really liked the book dean koontz is my favorite writers cause of him i am doing my own book pick this one up really good characters main character really good story and plot
i did n't know what to expect before reading this book but after reading it i recommend it to any and everyone one of the best i 've read of koontz and i 've read quite a few
kirk 's book is supposedly the bible of conservatives not but conservatives he sets up the long standing debate between the french and voltaie and the english using burke as it 's spokesman supposedly kirk would limit the vote have a professional class of government officials reduce if not eliminate most taxes and let each individual strive for success this is the basic mantra of classical conservatives and is all well and good as far as it goes but only a few of the many ever succeed this way one of the surprises is how young kirk was when this book was written it 's as if he had some inspiration for on high probably not or was cherry picking history probably closer to the truth after reading this book i had a better understanding of where the conservatives are coming from althohgh i still do n't understand why an obscure royalist politician from the century should be their flag bearer royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the us although we seem to flirt with it from time to time conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy as we currently have in the us they would rather rely on accidents of birth cronyism and college organizations to select administrators rather than people who have succeeded in other venues a very informative albeit frightening book
this book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking it is not very difficult to go online and read any number of conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day but this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of conservative intellectuals often times it is portrayed not without some merit that conservatives are i have frequently heard that liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual but the conservative mind blows a hole through all of that kirk examines major conservative thinkers like edmund burke john adams george canning benjamin disraeli john randolph of roanoke orestes brownson samuel taylor coleridge john calhoun and s eliot amung many many others the most difficult aspect of this book is to accept john randolph and john calhoun as figures to be celebrated they both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery although as another reviewer elquently noted kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that just the fact that conservatism is a the negation of ideology '' and that change will happen in kirk 's prospective calhoun was only following that line of thinking i personally do n't agree with it that far as obviously slavery was antithesis of what the declaration of independence and the constitution stand for but again stating kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been only that change has to follow the methods of that society i would recommend this to conservative or liberal it is a magifnicent study of conservativism it can be a little dense at times but that is to be expected and it should n't detour anyone from reading it
probably most people reading this already know of this book 's reputation and influence so i 'll skip over both the analysis and the praise i 'd end up in what kirk would call overweening '' praise anyway but i do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer the caricature to which i refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change in fact the reviewer even argued that the soviet union could have been seen as a conservative '' system an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media perhaps the reviewer missed or did n't understand kirk 's repeated references to conservatism as the negation of ideology '' an ideologist is anyone who tries to a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture think of the new soviet man '' in the soviet union think of the cultural revolution '' in china for that matter although it was n't imposed militarily think of the great society '' in america it worked out about as well as the first two the negation of ideology '' then is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies rather than imposing it on them from the top think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule america through the supreme court for a good example of the imposing from the top '' model sometimes this change can be quite radical radical in the sense of getting to the roots '' of something as in the american revolution which kirk discusses extensively the colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed and fought to extend it the reviewer also slanders kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery no our own constitution details life and liberty for all and the organic application of it as we see in our subsequent history extends that life and liberty to all even the writers of the constitution some of whom owned slaves themselves knew that the constitution 's principles would lead to freedom for all lincoln a republican let 's never forget certainly knew it if you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism this book is where to start do n't be put off by reviewers whose lack of sympathy for the subject leads them as well to a lack of understanding of the subject
i found kirk 's work to be an excellant antidote to the religious right and neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as conservatism '' today a good place to take back the conservative philosophy a philosophy of tolerance respect fairness and progress from the extremists bent on right wing christian '' tyranny
kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism among them pessimism conservatives do not trust human beings to seek the good we believe human beings are concupiscent and that government as an institution made up of concupiscent human beings is untrustworthy and corrupt a liberal believes human beings are essentially good modern liberalism '' aka socialism having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from has turned cynical there is a difference between healthy pessimism and cynicism anyway kirk begins by outlining 6 key points of conservative thought which are forgotten by our current liberal republican president then he discusses the major thinkers who defined conservatism from the late to early centuries
this was by far the most informational book i have ever read on conservatism i learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism also this book is very practicle and worthwhile no hype just fact and purpose anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking to those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book it is a book that should not be taken lightly the very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers a must have in every library it is in mine
what a charming story ! this book is a perfect quick read for an adult over a cup of hot cocoa a great adventure for a young girl it beckons to those who enjoyed the secret garden or isle of the blue dolphins i would heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting a good clean adventure into an old fashioned fantasy world
this story is exactly what it is supposed to be a good story for kids i do n't seem to recall jk rowling saying anything about it having a single thing to do with harry potter she loved the book as a child had she said she loved green eggs and ham someone would inevitably launch into why the flying ford anglia was based on the blue car sam i am drove up a tree give it a chance and form your own opinion
i just found out about this book as an adult read it and loved it i wish i had heard about it as a preteen or teenager it was exactly the type of book i read as a child while it does have magical elements it is not full of harry potter '' magic if people are lead here by jk rowling 's comments it is more fanciful and mysterious with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in a perfect escape from the real world for a bit it sounds like a movie is being made which intrigues me i ca n't wait to see how it translates to the big screen altogether it was an absolutely lovely book one i am going to recommend to others to read 'tween teen or adult
after reading some negative reviews of this book i needed to buy and read it myself i could n't believe that if the story was so bad they would be making a movie of it i believe that this is a charming fantasy '' nothing more so why make it anything else let children read and enjoy the story after all it is not meant to entertain adults silver horses magic and peculiar circustances do n't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie i for one am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen i will let my imagination run free with the little white horse and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement i recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops their imagine will soar !
my mother read me this book nearly 30 years ago i remember being totally drawn in by the magic maria 's special room with the star ceiling the big cat who turns out to be a lion so wonderful for a budding brain all children should read it
i recently purchased a new copy of this book i read it years ago in grade i enjoyed the book the second time and i 'm glad i have it for my future children to read someday the story is a pretty heartwarming one everyone gets along pretty well and there really is n't too much unhappiness in it everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt this is mainly a story about learning to compromise i would recommend this book for children primarily girls since the main character is a girl ages younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them it 's a nice story for adults too for the child within it 's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a dog '' and the unicorn as just a little white horse '' i must say that i prefer the picture on the cover of the first book i read it was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn i think that one was much prettier than the current cover art also a suggestion for parents or teachers when i originally read this book it was for a school book report part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book it was actually kind of fun though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as i did
if blood and gore is your preference do not read this book it is a simple story with a touch of magic i first read it when i was about 12 and have been looking for it ever since it has joined my home library for neighborhood children and my grandchildren
after literally stumbling across wallace 's brief interviews with hideous men '' i immediately purchased broom of the system '' through a series of dialouge and absurdly detailed passages the story of young lenore beadsmen unfolds before the reader 's enchanted eyes among the funnier characters there are lenore 's violently jealous boss who is coincedently her lover a friend from college and norman bombardini an obscenely obese with an unhealthy obsession for lenore although there are really no key plots the story is never dull and a lot of the short stories within the book critiqued by none other then lenore 's boss who runs a publishing company are reason enough alone to buy this paperback edition although i think the ending was overly abrupt it fits in well with the context of the character especially considering his apparent fixation on words '' the word itself is the word that should appear as the last word in the book if this made any sense to you whatsoever nonetheless this book is a definite must have for any wallace fan and an excellent introduction to him which will not give you a workout every time you pick it up to read like the hefty infinite jest '' undoubtedly will
i hate dfw i love dfw and so it goes this appears to be the tenor of the reviews as well as the general reaction that david foster wallaces writing seems to induce i became interested in reading the late century greats '' and began with infinite jest one hundred pages later i was sufficiently confused and decided to back off and read some early or shorter works by my authors of interest thus i read delillo 's body artist and dfws broom of the system despite the fact that dfw is clearly more intelligent than me i managed to finish the broom of the system it is more approachable than infinite jest funny and entertaining if you are new to dfw i would say that this book has a similar feel '' as the films the royal tenenbaums or i heart huckabees is this a perfect book no is the writing outstanding yes but not completely perfected is the plot compelling no then the historian and davinci code are compelling but thats all they offer what is it that makes this book worth 4 stars it is simply dfws ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late century he does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched it may be dfws lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated however recall that the greatest american novel '' moby dick was panned commercially and critically when first published was melville ahead of the collective curve probably is dfw also ahead of the curve given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing it is not unlikely either way the broom of the system offers an approachable starting point to one of the great writers of our time march onward delillo wallace and pynchon
this novel provides an interesting angle for fans of david foster a great book but clearly the product of a fascinating and inventive writer who is still figuring out the true extent of his voice thus while the book has many of the hallmarks of his writing the must '' of his subsequent works it also has a kind dare we brevity that is refreshing and works in the book 's favor while it stops short of the brilliance that followed this is still a wonderful book full of amazing characters amazing situations and is just plain an amazing read
one of the best books available on the subject of what is really happening in america recommended reading for those over the age of 18 thhat truly wants to understand what is happening to our country
with william cooper now dead killed in a shooting i feel it shows he was right trying to pass on this information he gave his life so we would know the truth
alot of folks love to criticize bill cooper i personally think he was reporting truths from his experiences information he got his hands on he claims right up front that some info may not be accurate he never claims to be 100 accurate and gives you his sources for the info not just opinions he took a stand to expose secret information he felt the public should know whether you agree with him or not you 've got to respect the man he fought to get this book published ultimately lost his life holding on to that stand '' it 's like him that gives us knowledge information to see hidden truths thank you god bless you bill rest in peace
this book is not for those who wish to continue living their monotonous and stressful lifestyles this is meant to make you aware and to further draw your own conclusions critical thinkers only ! ! also this is for the reviewer robert from jacksonvile florida you stated that you know the 'truth ' about william coopers death uhhm were you there no all you did was research on the internet and all of a sudden these truths emerged from the files revealing cooper 's death you stated that he was shot and killed by deputies like the govt for resisting arrest right okay then aparently you did not extract any information from this book and you are a waste of life watch these movies the island the matrix v for vendetta and countless others
there is some who would say that bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below but i just think is a liberal dupe there is also lots and i mean lots of conservative dupes i 'd say bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather to dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong there is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the federal reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts do your homework and you 'll see the crash of 29 ' was no accident the irs is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers now i do n't know about the illuminati or skull and bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected this book covers it all not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface this is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt slime and worms are as for bill 's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this either way this book is a good and informative read
and every american should read this book then pass it on to bush his friends and family members
pay no attention to reviews about this book read and dicide for yourself what is going on in these 500 pages of mind boggling information you ca n't really take the book as proven fact though as cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book himself behold a pale horse '' is really just a collection of information that cooper had been distributing for many years he faxed news letters held public lectures and debates and dedicated his life and perhaps even his death to revealing the truth about the people that rule our nation and possibly our world if he 's not one of them '' as he states several times in the book then william cooper is a true or puppet i 'm really not sure the thing that i liked about the book though was that he simply proposes several conclusions '' the book based on whatever information he 'd found he attempted to verify everything that he came across and i think that cooper honestly felt like he had a real chance at hendering whatever might be coming however what affects might this book have had on the world if you 're on a search for truth this book is the origin of a lot of the information that people will hand you i could n't even begin to think about all of the ways that this book alone might have inspired people heh or the number of watch lists i could have put myself on for posting this review
a friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right it is one of the most underrated books out there it 's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old the real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives one of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity buy it read it and pass along to your friends and family
if you do n't have it then buy it everyone should own a copy
i recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life and i 'm grateful that i did it encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type however it does n't leave anything out while addressing each topic in a succinct way it is not new and a few of the examples given will be dated that does n't lessen it 's messages in anyway
written around 50 years ago this book still holds true it is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success like most 'success ' based books the concepts in here wo n't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple think success and gain success the belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success believing you can will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons it will find a how so you can achieve your goal conversely if you believe you ca n't your mind will find reasons to support your claim the application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within coincidentally this book arrived a few days before i had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind i passed the first interview easily nailed the second one and got the job ! it 's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind it 's also a book you will want to lend people you care about highly reccommended buy it !
this book has made a huge difference in the way i react work play and think about things that come up all the time the highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel
i am not sure i would have used the word magic '' in the title actually there is no magic in thinking big but the results of following the advice given by schwartz might seem like magic the simple truth is that most people have very beliefs and as a result think in terms of small achievements change your way of thinking and you change your life as schwartz points out success is achieved by following conscientiously and continuously a plan for and growth '' and he gives you a plan the book is well written full of interesting stories and great advice if you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward you will make considerable improvement in your life some of the more notable bits of wisdom '' we learn nothing from telling but there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening '' others see in us what we see in ourselves '' people who tell you it can not be done almost always are unsuccessful people '' '' before you start out know where you want to go '' the book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom however like any great advice it is useless unless and until the reader takes action for the words to benefit you you must take action a great blueprint for taking action but taking action is up to the reader
refreshing audio letting yourself be and then relate and apply what you hare to your present situation this audio cd will is good for those people that are constantly on the go
this book is a classic just like napoleon hill 's think and grow rich the idea is basic and simple you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful it does not matter what degrees you have if you are not going to think about how to overcome your problems be it social economical or whatever problem you must take action as stated in this book action cures fear so if you fear something then do something and the fear is gone
i enjoyed this book very much the author was very clear about her research and the conclusions she reached it really helps explain the cultural setting of belly dance in egypt better than any other book i 've read and it 's fascinating reading as well due to the little details she tells us about dancers living in egypt a book for those interested in egyptian belly dance
too many books about eastern dance lean toward fantasy rather than scholarship van nieuwkerk 's book explores the seemingly paradoxical relationship many people have toward egyptian belly dancing and dancers and details the history of the dance over the past few centuries
while probably not the best handicapping book even from the beyer set this is one of the more entertaining handicapping books around you should read his earlier stuff first to see how he evolved as a handicapper to incorporate some ideas such as pace trip and form cycles where earlier he had largely dismissed those where i spent a lot of time taking notes from other handicapping books i spent more time turning pages and just enjoying a good read here
a very well written book easy to read entertaining and full of useful information this book makes otherwise complex theories easy to follow the use of anecdotes and real life examples allow for easier understanding of the ideas presented this is a useful addition to the library of any horseracing fan the serious student of horse racing handicapping should easily recover several times the price of the book from using the information presented that is a safe bet
andrew beyer is the godfather of speed figures in thoroughbred racing in preparing to bet the kentucky derby and other races this year i read andrew beyer 's fantastic book beyer on speed '' and joe cardello 's book speed to spare '' these two books fundamentally changed the way i handicap races it is simply careless to handicap races without understanding beyer speed ratings and use them to your advantage this book explains the origins of the beyer speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work i used the information on beyer on speed '' and speed to spare '' this year march 2005 to hit a big trifecta at santa anita without beyer speed ratings and the information they provide i would have never made the bet i made andrew beyer is not only a great author but he is at the forefront of making a day at the races enjoyable to all beyer on speed '' is a book that will absolutely make your trip to the track more enjoyable than you can imagine beyer does n't the various elements that make handicapping a science but he does help you understand the fundamentals in a very concise way i appreciate andrew beyer 's commitment to that is so evident in this book and in all his other writings andrew beyer remains at the forefront of the war against doping in racing and other issues andrew beyer is one of the reasons that horse racing is such a great sport this book is for anyone wanting to know how to quickly understand the joys and pitfalls of handicapping and why thorougbred racing is so much fun
this book is not for the beginning handicapper but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book i have read most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks but little knowledge is given to the reader beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper i wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days then show you how they break down the races to make their selections not with programs they want to sell it would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track if they would bet it or pass it
this book is not for the beginning handicapper but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book i have read most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks but little knowledge is given to the reader beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper i wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days then show you how they break down the races to make their selections not with programs they want to sell it would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track if they would bet it or pass it
reading andrew beyer is at once informative and entertaining which anything on handicapping has no excuse not being while his first book introduced speed figures and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping this book revisits the holistic approach always emphasizing speed figures in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever and many even know how to use it what makes reading beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see vividly the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches in the stories one might call them lessons he recounts the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing beyer like bill james is a scientist and thinks like one to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides and making the same old mistakes people like beyer and steve davidowitz are largely responsible for the arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves it 's a wonderful game but if you do n't want to get left behind better read this

wonderful yet so very sad at the same time i am a huge danielle steele fan this book along with all her others are tops

this book is very an excellent description of a woman who is in a bad relationship and feels trapped interesting how she manages to wiggle free and start her life over again
this is the third edition of this book that i own as a dual diagnosis counselor i have found this book to be an invaluable resource the psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible i find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action
a primer of drug action is a nontechnical guide to the actions uses and side effects of psychoactive drugs which will prove important for any psychology or health library collection a primer of drug action covers everything from herbal applications to clinical treatments of psychological disorders revealing the latest findings in the applications of drug therapy to various conditions
i first read a friend 's copy of this book which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course i soon acquired my own copy and a number of my friends have read it it 's a very accessible introduction to drugs with generally good pointers into more specific literature julien 's strengths are in the area of legitimate prescription use i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less complete the chapter on psychedelics is unfortunately errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book this book has been an indespensible reference for me
i became aware of this book because it was used as the textbook for a recent upper level biopsychology seminar it was one of the best books i have ever had to use for a class and i believe is an extremely valuable reference for anyone with interest in the way drugs affect the brain the writing is clear concise informative interesting and complete each chapter gives an overview of the family of drugs and then goes into detail on a few of the most common examples everything from delivery to to molecular action to side effects is covered many of my friends went out and bought the book after looking at my copy to learn about either their recreational habits or prescription drugs a background in biology would be useful for understanding all of the information but there are also appendices which explain the basics
this book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations there are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this however after reading it it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material i am sure that some of that is for effect but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring i still recommend it as a read but i do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message
the information and the examples in the book are easily applied and really do make a difference i used the book as a reference working with first line managers it is especially useful to them in confronting passive aggressive communication styles
i kept thinking that this book was about business and would n't be applicabable to me but boy was i wrong this is an amazingly insightful book that helped me in every area of my life business and personal take susan scott 's advice and apply her suggestions to all areas of your life and you will be living at a much heightened level as she states it it helps you come out from behind yourself and become real
i 've just come back to fierce conversations for about the tenth time scott has developed the clearest instructions on open direct communication i 've seen in years of working with clients around communication issues she gives easy to understand guidelines and supports each with excellent examples anyone who has been around long enough to have read the early texts on action science will appreciate scott 's ability to put complex concepts into understandable action this is a for anyone wishing to practice communication at its best
if you 've ever wondered about how to have a single conversation that will make a difference this book will provide the guidance for that conversation scott is quite skilled at creating a simple approach to difficult situations one caution that i would offer is that this book is not a magic silver bullet you have to do some work and actually call upon some courage on your own the tools that this book provides is only have the battle that which you bring will provide the missing link there is great value here this book is truly a gift that you will find valuable i recommend it highly
this is a worthwhile book for personal and leadership development it contains practical tools such as 1 the decision tree for delegation and professional development 2 a confrontation model 3 questions for fuel for discussion with colleagues and direct reports 4 a leader 's stump speech where am i going why am i going there who is going with me how will i get there 5 the concept of our emotional wake '' worth reading and pondering about an emotional wake is what you remember after i 'm gone the aftermath aftertaste or afterglow '' 6 the image of the crucible to remind us that our job is simply to hold so that whatever needs to be said what needs to be heard can safely be said and heard '' and much more there are also many fresh metaphors one is tempted to keep highlighting the book rich quotations references to books music poetry good examples and stories i also appreciated the assignments '' and brief summaries at the end of each chapter
i bought the book on cd listened to it and immediately listened to it a second time it contains invaluable information for business leadership development practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions i assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation it was not it was about encouraging and accepting honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact
susan scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all pretending not to know '' i was consistently impacted while reading it not so much that the material is brand new but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious one of the topics discussed is called mineral rights '' a type of conversation designed to get deep past the surface and into the truth of what is going on the approach accomplishes four purposes interrogate reality provoke learning tackle tough challenges and enrich relationships it has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate america and is rarer still where i work now the book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them the many questions posed throughout the book and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace the answers usually are in the room '' if we can really get honest and start looking for them in addition to some great business council much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves often we are the problem and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships another great approach used is the decision tree '' to help build empowerment in others communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others page 252 her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool both internally and in interactions with others were right on while this was all excellent and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our emotional wake '' we all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people the question is what kind of wake do we want to leave how do we want people to feel this served as a great wake up call for me while reading overall this book is so full of great wisdom and insights i could n't begin to do it justice here from the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout i believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication i have read it is both deep and practical both academically sound and real world tested and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself highly recommended !
a must read a possible next target for the us or israel check today 's news let's hope our new congress is able to make the right decision after getting the best unbiased intelligence they should make sure scott ritter who was very accurate on iraq he s not as knowledgeable on who is is thoroughly involved in their discussions before any military action strenuous efforts at real diplomacy with all the players in the region are essential
scott ritter and seymour hersh have made at least two appearances at the new york society for ethical culture in the past year to discuss us foreign policy issues concerning iraq and more recently iran the october 16 2006 appearance covered the issues of ritter 's current book target iran transcripts and podcasts are available it is ritter 's contention that the busch administration 's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed this administration will not talk to those it considers it 's enemies this has been challenged in the media by the james baker group but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes target iran according to ritter in based on press coverage in the middle east and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community the story is that america is already working inside iran with dissidents to identify targets we are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the middle east war once that is completed this administration intends to attack the public is and will be sold the same scenario in which ala downing street memo the facts will be fixed around the policy why will this happen one element is the influence of israel iran is perceived and not incorrectly as a major threat to israel but ritter makes the point that israeli and american interests are not identical after the recent events in southern lebanon watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever israel was going to do it 's hard to see much separation whatever the threat to us from iran ritter says it 's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war iran according to ritter approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it 's nuclear research they were rebuffed busch can only visualize regime change if this goes forward as hersh and ritter both seem to think is inevitable what are the chances of success according to these gentlemen the results will be utter catastrophe iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their us contracts us troops in iraq will be under attack by the shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack iranian missiles will be directed against the saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets the world economy will be plunged into a massive recession this could lead to a ground invasion of us troops most likely from uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already here is where ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of iran he thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an american city these scenarios seem outlandish except there are so many radical republican sources cheering on war with iran that one can not expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business of course they visualize success not the failure predicted by ritter the massive failure of our government during katrina and the fiasco in iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the busch administration what if war with iran leads to the doomsday scenario that ritter and hersh talk about this book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public the potential of a democratic house of representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by ritter american militarism is ascendant as ritter says if the war in iraq were going well the public would be very satisfied the fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about too many democrats only talk about running a competent war
scott ritter provides chapter and verse on how conflict with the axis of evil nations could have been avoided with direct negotiation the mullahs of iran sought to negotiate with everything on the table including nuclear weapons and a treaty with israel north korea still wants direct negotiations so did saddam we do n't negotiate with regimes we want to remove bush prefers to take them out '' no matter how many americans die
first published in 1999 and its still going selling strong ! this manual has a lot going for it it is a practical manual with clear pictures illustrating every posture with a descriptive teaching of the postures david covers the basics intermediate right through to the full flow with 263 pages of davids yoga and teachings i reccomend this book to anyone starting out in yoga in particular because it does give visual learners good pictures to grasp and learn from
this book is the best book on ashtanga yoga on the market a must have for any person interested in ashtanga yoga it covers all aspects showing easier versions of the poses so that the beginner can also follow it the back of the book has shorter versions of the full primary series so that when you are limited for time you can do a shorter workout the only thing about this book that is not so great is that when you have used it for a long time the edges of the pages start to tear due to the way it has been bound it has been bound this way so that the pages stay open while you are practising a pose
this was recommended to me by my ashtanga teacher it has great photos and really complements what you hear in class i understand more the drishti eye gazes and what the modifications to the poses are when i think about it i open it up and read about a particular pose that i am having some trouble with it 's really nice to have around i do wish it had the sanskrit counting in it but that is a minor thing
this book is a fantastic guide for your ashtanga yoga i would recommend reading yoga mala pattabhi jois first and then using this book as a guide for your practice illustrations are clear vivid and easy to follow the binding of the book allows for propping while praticing david swenson does a fantastic walking through step by step how to get into each pose i use it everyday
david swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal ashtanga practice i have been doing ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by david 's primary series dvd and this book since i first began my practice for anyone who does not have ashtanga experience can not find a teacher in their area or want to practice outside of a yoga class david 's dvds are incredible and instructive this book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace this book is also phenomenal for those experienced in ashtanga who want to create a mysore practice a mysore practice is a quiet practice the only sound is your breath while you go through the sequence at your own pace it 's a profound opportunity to hear your own voice '' and in my experience builds a deep inner trust swenson 's book not only lets you look at one asana at a time but it also provides an '' sequence for a kind of cliff notes '' effect this was excellent to have by my mat as a reminder of the sequence while creating my mysore practice i have had the great fortune to take a class and teacher training with david swenson he has a style humor and an incredible knowledge of ashtanga that shines through in his book and dvds i highly recommend his work to anyone interested in ashtanga yoga
as an ashtanga enthusiast i am always on the look out for new things to add to my collection my first ashtanga teacher made copies of this book for me years ago and i loved those few pages now that i have bought the entire book i see just how wonderful it really is ! it explains each posture in both the primary and intermediate series in simple to understand language plus david swenson includes various modifications for difficult poses which is always helpful also included in this book are a few short practices sequenced togethery by swenson lasting 15 30 45 minutes these are excellent as well ! this is a wonderful ashtanga book that any yogi or yogini who practices ashtanga needs to own ! good for all levels beginner through expert highly recommended !
i 've reviewed most ashtanga books out there and this is by far the best ! ! ! the fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or really like how swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that ca n't stretch like gumby '' recommended
this is an excellent look at ashtanga yoga swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at yoga standing series and finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich with the primary series as the filling in the sandwich and the idea of a vinyasa as the etch a sketch '' which clears the slate for each new asana and his physics of flight '' and ground transportation '' as a means to jumping forward my only wish for the book would be that it would contain a page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page it would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down also ok i have one more wish i appreciated the break down of the sanskrit word into meanings but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too otherwise it is nearly perfect
this book is a classic and david swenson is well loved by the yoga community i 'll admit that i find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes david did the design and layout himself but you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import overall i find david 's voice friendly supportive and unassuming he does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students this book covers a lot of information including primary series and intermediate series between owning this book and astanga '' by jean hall 0754810747 which has lots of luscious color photos featuring a variety of models especially jean hall i have access to a balanced presentation of astanga
even for the this is a great book normally i 'm not too sympathetic to lefty books that will cleary be read by a number of conservatives that you could count on your hands and maybe one foot but even the choir will find this a fair assessment of the liberal media myth and best of all the american public comes off looking like a culprit as much as a victim ultimately people vote with their eyes ears and wallets if the public demands and devours media slop then that 's what they 'll get and to a large extent deserve this is great read he 's a talented writer who knows his stuff and he is very clear about his background potential conflicts of interest and personal relationships to those about whom he writes no exaggeration to call this a great book
as a student at oklahoma state university i am very interested in journalism and broadcasting eric alterman 's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media the purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media after reading through the book i came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than i look at it i recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media
after having lived in nyc for 12 years i finally read this book it had been recommended as a for anyone who had ever lived in the city many reviewers commented on the leisurely '' pace of the story and i agree the description of the event in the climax of the story though i found too long and almost unbearably tedious especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book the time travel part was especially troubling to me i was n't at all convinced of its process however i still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending as many have said stick with it
this book was on my summer reading list and i was thinking that it was going to be horrible but it was the exact opposite i love the book and enjoyed every minute that i read it ! i love how finney uses pictures in the book it helps you to grasp the changes that occured in the scenery of manhattan
others have summarized i 'll add that this novel is one of the best i 've read slow starting but stick with it read the sequel also try to find the third level '' one of finney 's lesser known short stories also about time
the descriptions of 1882 new york smack of reality more than anything i have ever read the reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel i have ever read truly amazingly authentic the tale starts out slowly but brings the reader to an awesome conclusion extremely satisfying a beautiful story there is everything here science fiction mystery action philosophy and a bit of romance highly recommended
i bought this book in 1970 when i had just started college it is one of the few books i have kept for all these years and have regularly the premise for the story is a young man si morley who joins a government program to go back in time to the ny of 1880 's the past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story not only is it entertaining containing romance and mystery but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today this is a book you 'll enjoy reading one i ca n't recommend highly enough
a quantum leap of reading how his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable and personal story around each one is an amazing feat i found myself wondering if he did travel back in time was it possible could i do it i even tried the he told about picking the civil war as my target no did n't work for me yet ! would i love to do it ! the ending of this book shook me he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way it 's amazing read the mirror '' read diana gabaldon 's time travel series but please do n't miss including this book as your number one best dog eared copy of your library you wo n't be sorry
this book starts out slow but once you get past the first few chapters you wo n't be able to put it down if you know anything about new york you will find it fascinating i 'm not sure if it would be as appealing to someone who has never been to new york but the story is good regardless
the sense of actually being in the 's was so strong that i felt i had to decompress to bring myself back to my own time and i did so very reluctantly a wonderful story with amazing images ! highly recommended
i love o'reilly there are aspects of his personality that i do not like but bill is a voice in the wilderness of cable news today he yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up this separates him from everyone else cable news and radio weather those people are liberal or conservative i honestly do n't know what side of the aisle bill sits on think reading this book is worth your time
my husband brought this home and reading some of it it reflects some very common sense realities about politics along with some fairly harsh criticisms of many of the players '' associated with campaigns and elections a long time boston resident and close to the action in most cases the author exhibits an uncommon knowledge of more than a few events '' and cautions the readers to try and look beyond the momentary hype to assess the value and the progress of our american political campaigns to see who really winds up on top and too often who really winds up on the bottom and often screwed a highly informative read and one that appeals to logic as the ruler by which american democracy is played out and its relation to ordinary citizens ''
i find bill 's books to be easy reads which is important if he wants to reach a diverse audience this book is a great motivator for personal growth i finished it feeling much like i did after reading the o'reilly factor '' i wanted to improve myself and my life i would recommend this book to anyone regardless of their interest in bill 's show on fox news i have a friend who dislikes bill and she would benefit from reading this book it 's too bad her mind is n't open enough to give it a try do n't make the same mistake this book is extremely informative motivational and
if you are a fan of o'reilly and are interested in his personal anecdotes and their place in his life 's journey then you 'll enjoy this book do n't expect any startling revelations but do expect a good dose of common sense and a challenge to apply it in your own life
thought the book was great and factual certainly worth the time and money
i 'm like many of the statistical women described in the book who found themselves living well while married and then found themselves divorced and broke with little to show for years of sacrifice and hard work it was then i discovered how dependent i had become on someone else to provide for my financial future i call it marital welfare '' and i do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands kim kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart it was the you 're on the right track '' message that i needed to hear to further my resolve not just in finances but in every area where needs to evolve the good news is that i am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans goals and dreams and shares in the excitement this book does not give a but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you view your life for many people that 's all it takes and in that regard this book has accomplished wonders

this was not the book i expected it to be but it has won me over kim is n't saying that the mechanics of investing are different for women but the motivations rewards and value of investing groups are that 's why there 's so many references to rich dad poor dad '' etc go there to learn more about pure investing this book is about defining yours goals motivations and getting some tips and if you do something you 're probably going to succeed the stories of the group of friends are sometimes distracting but they serve an important purpose of letting you identify with situations activating your empathy and getting the message across much more effective than a dry objective book i 'm telling my friends about it

this is a good read this is what happens when you work hard at something and belive in yourself just like tavis has
i am white grew up in a small ohio town with no blacks went in the marine corp my first exposure to the black community you might say then spent a couple decades in corporate america as our country has moved along from the sixties and the appropriate black activities of the time i have to say this book is a pleasent surprise it has no big discussion on the whites that cause all their problems it is just a downright honest book about one life lived well sometimes tavis arrogance comes through and i imagine there are those along the way that would have some say about that but it doesnt matter this book outlines a black success story against incredible odds but more importantly it is an american success story you can all learn alot about growing up black and growing up impoverished in america as i did from this more importantly tavis outlines how we can forgive and love one another which is most important great book and a greater person
tavis is a man that puts god first and he has never made him last the book is truly remarkable just when i thought he had reached his highest potential here he goes again just like the man the book intrigues the mind to think outside of the box he tells of his strengths his weaknesses his successes his failures and each lesson that was learned along the way keep it coming tavis keep intriguing the mind to think this is story about how he became the man he is today ! i just gave my teenage son the book and i will be purchasing copies for each of the young men in my family
the most creative power given to the human spirit is the power to heal the wounds of a past it can not change we do our forgiving alone inside our hearts and minds what happens to the people we forgive depends on them the first person to benefit from forgiveness is the one who forgives forgiveness happens in three stages we rediscover the humanity of the person who wronged us we surrender our right to get even and we wish that person well forgiveness is a journey the deeper the wound the longer the journey forgiveness does not require us to reunite with the person who broke our trust we do not forgive because we are supposed to we forgive when we are ready to be healed waiting for someone to repent before we forgive is to surrender our future to the person who wronged us forgiveness is not a way to avoid pain but to heal the pain forgiveness is the only way to be fair to ourselves forgivers are not doormats to forgive a person is not a signal that we are willing to put up with what he does forgiveness is essential talking about it is optional when we forgive we set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner we set free is us when we forgive we walk in stride with the forgiving god
after i read obama 's book i chanced to check out what other black writers were writing that lead me to tavis smiley s what i know for sure and the proper criticism of some decent people by theophilus green obama 's critique of american politics and green's evaluation of black american politics and their leaders combined to give me perhaps the most comprehensive review of modern american politics that i have ever read after reading smiley 's book i had a more personal perspective and most certainly after reading his covenant with black america what i found most telling about obama 's book was his honesty and straight forwardness green 's book was honest in an irreverent directness that stimulated as much thinking about america as it did the definition of american smiley 's book wrapped it up with a personal reflection on all that was hoped for dreamt for and needed to have happen all three are must reads preferably at the same time
what i know for sure is that tavis smiley 's testimony and transparency through this book was a refreshing read he is a prolific speaker and a voice for this generation i applaud him for allowing us to share intimately into his life i was deeply moved by his honesty in retelling the experiences that shaped the man we now see today the candidness expressed in each chapter allowed us to witness the forces that birth his purpose and propelled his drive ambition and advocacy his love for people was greatly evident this book is a must read not just for but for anyone who has faced adversity challenges and trying circumstances in life greatly inspiring
who is tavis smiley initially tavis ' prominence in the media led me to think this guy was just a ' a person simply trying to find a means to move up in this world however years have shown me i was wrong tavis smiley is a man of conviction i have witnessed his passion and service and have been an indirect recipient of its affects his book what i know for sure '' shows that he is indeed a man of great determination and drive and yes he is in fact trying to go somewhere yet the beauty of the story and his life is that he desires to take a nation of folks with him i greatly appreciate tavis for having the courage to share his trials and triumphs with the public it was refreshing to read a story where a black man 's battles were not with drugs or sex but with deeper elements that tend to birth destructive surface habits that deceivedly garner too much of our attention the deeper issues are how do we navigate our spirituality and poverty or better yet our spirituality and our god given gifts is one married to the other does one negate the other are there gifts to be used in religious confines and then others meant for worldly consumption how do we as african americans mature in mind to understand that god so loved the world '' that he gave gifts gifts to be used to open college doors and business opportunities and platforms for change a freeing of his people what i know for sure '' is a great story i am requiring my 17 year old son to read it i will give it as a gift to my nephews brother and i plan to send it to my childhood friend who is now in prison in fact it is my hope that everyone who struggles to define understand or find evidence of black man '' in today 's society might read this book read yellow black '' by haki madhubuti the pact '' by davis jenkins and hunt and denzel washington 's new book a hand to guide me '' these books speak to contemporary situations and will undoubtedly prove to be as relevant for this period of time as souls of black folks '' black boy '' and invisible man '' were for theirs great work tavis !
i 've always dug respected tavis smiley big time i 've always respected his vast knowledge ability to communicate be direct just do his thing this book takes you back to his upbringing this book pulls no punches about what he dealt with as a young black man growing up in a household of a large family also dealing with getting whippings this was the era which back in the day only applied to sports games and dealing with his own self in the process everybody sees hears the success but not many people are aware of the struggle this man had to endure the many lasting images things he had to deal with mentally i applad brother tavis smiley for not being afraid to settting the record straight this book will hit you in so many ways depending on your own upbringing it might be close to your own story i can relate to it big does n't back down to bet or npr without a doubt is one of the most important voices out here he keeps it real this book is very direct real

i just finished think and grow rich for the time the first time i read it i was a twenty something and did n't fully grasp it the next time i read it i was a forty something and i reaped great benefits by implementing these principles into my life and career now i am almost sixty and i finally understand the book napoleon hill was clearly correct when he stated that it is very seldom that a young person can grasp the master keys to riches after completing this book for the third time i am looking forward to an even more satisfying and productive future i highly recommend this book to those who want to find the keys to success and riches as well as peace of mind there should be a college curriculum built around this book in today 's society the concepts of and individualism are dying concepts this book will teach you how to use your mind to achieve anything that you desire everyone desiring success and riches should read this book please do not take offense to the masculine references contained in the book it should be remembered that this book was completed almost 70 years ago and society was different '' it 's principles apply to both genders and all races and ethnic groups
whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve '' hill if you asked me to recommend to you the single best book i have ever read my answer would be a very definite think and grow rich '' first published in 1937 this is the end product of two decades of research conducted by napoleon hill his research started when andrew carnegie the steel tycoon who was then the richest man on earth gave him the assignment of organizing a philosophy of personal achievement hill who was a poor journalist armed with just an introductory letter from carnegie set out to interview over five hundred successful people including henry ford thomas edison alexander graham bell john rockefeller george eastman william wrigley and charles schwab hill then revealed the priceless wisdom of his research in the form of the thirteen steps to success in think and grow rich and the seventeen principles of success in courses and lectures he conducted the concepts taught by napoleon hill transformed my life some of these include developing a definite purpose building a positive mental attitude pma channeling the power of the mind and dealing with adversity everything he wrote about or talked about is thought provoking he was wise humble and funny his philosophy is universal he did not mix it with religion the riches he referred to were more than money for the philosophy of personal achievement can be applied to anything in life this is a classic and hence the examples are old not to be confused with outdated but they are as relevant today as they were in the early twentieth century here is an example from t gr in the chapter on desire on the morning after the great fire of chicago 1871 a group of merchants on chicago 's state street went into a conference to decide whether to rebuild their stores or leave chicago all but one decided to leave the merchant who decided to stay pointed a finger to the remains of his store and said gentlemen on that very spot i will build the world 's greatest store no matter how many times it may burn down '' his name was marshall field and his store still exists and in hill 's words is a towering monument to that state of mind known as a burning desire '' i lived in chicago from 2002 through 2004 and worked three blocks away from this impressive store on state street sometimes i would visit it or stand outside it to derive inspiration and be reminded of the power of desire it is amazing that hill describes burning desire '' with a story based on the chicago fire there are thousands of books out in the market and hundreds of self proclaimed gurus '' who have made a living by copying the wisdom in hill 's books as i went through some of those books i realized that there was not much in them that hill had not already written about i recommend quality over quantity instead of reading through many books i recommend that you study the following works of hill and internalize his wisdom 1. think and grow rich 1937 i recommend the action pack edition 2. napoleon hill 's keys to success the 17 principles of personal achievement this is an excellent guide to his principles 3. your right to be rich unabridged this consists of 12 hours of live lectures covering the 17 principles that hill conducted in chicago in 1954. by internalizing i mean studying in depth analyzing the ideas making notes and summaries i own more cds by hill but i believe that these 3 items make the perfect study plan on the philosophy of personal achievement some have criticized hill 's work by stating that his research was unscientific they pass him up for jim collins whose good to great '' dedicates 76 out of its 300 pages to research methodology and notes that hardly anybody ever reads or marcus buckingham whose first break '' similarly uses 25 pages for gallup 's meta analysis and what not these people do n't know what they are missing i am greatly indebted to napoleon hill the purpose of my writing this is to spread awareness of his work so that more people can benefit from it this i believe is the best way in which hill would have liked to have been repaid if my review was helpful to you i request you to select yes '' so that the rating is improved and more readers will get to read it for more information on this author please read my so you 'd like to guides '' on the best management books and my other reviews select my username to get to those pages please also see the website of the napoleon hill foundation naphill dot org which has helpful resources
i have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that i have read to make the material come to life after reading think grow rich and after reading so many positive reviews here i decided to go out and buy this one as well to tell you the truth it was sort of anticlimatic the exercises were good but i pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide i had already read think grow rich at least a dozen times so thought i knew this material i did but i went to the back of the book and took the 5 examinations i had to admit that i knew what napolean hill wanted as answers but could n't truly say in all honesty that i was where i needed to be or wanted to be in the five categories listed so i went to work on my weak areas which i thought i did n't have before reading this book this part of the book alone was for me well worth the price of buying this version of think and grow rich i think a lot of people will benefit from the action pack because so many people i know will read the book once and think they 've got it the action pack will make you roll up your sleeves clear the mental cobwebs learn the material but even more importantly make the material bring out the qualities inside you that lead to success
i am a huge fan of napolean hill and this book in particular this book is think grow rich plus an action guide when i first read the book think grow rich i got great results but when i used this book with the action guide my results were greatly magnified
seems that anyone who 's anyone worth knowing has read this old classic that usually sets me off i do n't like being mainstream yet so many successful entrepreneurs told me to read it and i knew i 'd be spending hours at the beach last summer anyway so i snatched up a copy this book was the start of a new way of thinking for me a new way to think about business relationships money my own power and the world the exercises in the back were at times cumbersome i was really hoping that this book was an actual workbook that i could pen even still the exercises were a necessary part of my growth i suggest everyone should get the action pack instead of the standard edition
the think grow rich action pack is a phenomenal book that will help you to reach your maximum potential achieve your goals build your character and develop your leadership skills the think grow rich action pack is a great guide on how to personalize '' think grow rich to your walk in life i discovered think and grow rich when i read former heavyweight boxing champion and international boxing hall of famer ken norton 's autobiography going the distance '' norton shared in his book that he read think grow rich and it changed his life norton 's book states he was prescribed to read think grow rich after he suffered his first boxing defeat and had to start over he then went on to beat muhammed ali for the title norton shares in his book that he read think grow rich repeatedly during his career and he became a stonger person for it
i still have my original copy it 's very tattered and worn after the of hours of reading and but it remains an important part of my life this book has had the most significant impact on my life than any other book i 've read not including the bible many years ago i fell into some very difficult times i went from riches to rags by a stroke of luck this book jumped off the bookshelf and saved my life it lifted me up got me positive and helped me reshape who i was it has been my source of strength ever since it taught me how to take my dreams and make them a reality how i could focus my energy and teach myself how to become what it was i dreamed it taught me how i could organize my life make a decision about what i wanted to do with it and go after my goals with persistence itstead of being depressed i could establish a state of mind that could overcome any obstacle and go after any desire with confidence napoleon hill interviewed the most successful people of his time and extracted the secrets that made them rich successful and happy i highly recommend this book if you 're down in the dumps it will lift you up if you 're rich in money but unhappy it will show you how to refocus and join the riches of money with happiness or even if your life seems perfect it will revitalize you and help you realize the potential you did n't even realize you possessed so pick up this book the cost is insignificant when you see what it does for your life it will change it forever and the action pack reinforces the concepts and helps you apply them to your life
after graduating from college i questioned my education i guess i was n't happy with the path that i chose too bad that i realized that right after i graduated however just by chance i read michael gerber 's the e myth revisited the book completely geared me towards a different goal instead of going into education i decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business that 's when i decided to research books about success and what it takes i stumbled upon think and grow rich i read all the reviews on and instead of buying the book i decided to rent a copy from the library i took few days to read it right after i finished reading it i decided to purchase my own copy it was possibly the most important decision i 've made in my life i 'd like to claim that the book changed my life in addition i read several other books written by napoleon hill og mandino zig ziglar jeff keller and many more however i found that think and grow rich served as a template to everyone else 's work napoleon hill presented his discoveries quite clearly and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone 's life ever since then i 've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of louis i 'm proud to say that i could n't have done it without the help of napoleon hill and his book think and grow rich this book was not only written to get rich but also to change people in a positive way whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete this book will definitely help you achieve any goals like napoleon hill said whatever your mind can conceive and believe it can achieve '' these are the words to live by ! this book should be your starting point towards life 's riches you can then follow up by reading napoleon hill 's other books as well as books written by other authors on the same topic
i am a personal growth coach and i do some work in the area of sexuality there are many people that are inhibited around their fantasies or feel guilt for having normal sexual feelings i feel this book is useful because it provides a wide array of different types of fantasies that are common in themes in the female population this can be a very helpful book to help people normalize their feelings of shame and guilt around their innocent fantasies i also like that this book provides some psychological interpretation of female fantasies and is organized around themes the content is erotic but tasteful on the other hand people 's authentic experience is captured and the content is not necessarily i think this book will appeal more to women than to men among other things it will help women to realize that they are not unique in having certain desires that they do n't fully understand or want to have happen in real life two other great books that describe the psychology of sex and sexual fantasy are the erotic mind by jack morin and the evolution of desire by david buss
if we can get beyond the fact that all of us guys get super by this and love to read these fantasies then we can objectively take a look at this book what is interesting to note is that women down deep have the same drives basically that men do they may have been taught to repress them or express them differently but we are sexual of us male and female nancy friday does a great job of reminding us of that fact yes some things you read here are shocking and maybe unsettling but remember she just took the information sent to her and compiled the book i found this book fascinating for many reasons
i found this book on a shelf at a library over 10 years ago it was a hardcover book and the artwork was rather nondescript what i browsed through within though is seared into my conscience and really opened my eyes to the world of female lust thought i admit nothing has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside even hardcore it 's all about intent motive desire is it real is it sincere you could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem less than perfect '' it almost always is the look in her eye or the pitch of her voice something that conveys warmth you know more than anything seeing and feeling a palpable hunger an aching so deep it hurts for satisfaction i found a lot of that energy in this book and it was divine i wish friday would release another compilation of this material
let 's be straight this is a book full of real people 's sexual fantasies it 's not guided by some moral code the world imposes on us nor is it subject to the same code when being read it is individual 's fantasies escapism exploration of the mind where boundaries have no place the reader is supposed to have reactions evoked because some of what happens within a world of fantasy is so outside the real worlds acceptability that when looked at form the real world it seems alien and stimulates our ingrained sense of right or wrong it gives an insight into the women who 've contributed psyche often how women as sexual beings have been repressed by the world around them and unable or unwilling because of their confines to rebel in the real world have conjured in their minds elaborate and amazing ways to escape mentally which in turn has enabled the conscious self to accept who they are and apply their own morals and values to their lives rather than ones given to them by their parents and religions and upbringing ! an uplifting book for those who are n't afraid to explore themselves
these three works are wonderful in themselves and fascinating in their anticipations of crowley 's visionary masterpiece and one of american fiction 's handful of true masterpieces little big 1981 perpetually warring factions on a distant planet are thrown out of equilibrium when a stranger appears among them the deep is a gnostic parable ingeniously hidden in a adventure novel plot its secret concern is with the origins of the renaissance historically and as an emblem of personal rebirth the ending is really really something beasts hides itself a bit also in the dying america of a future earth biologically engineered hybrids attempt to throw off their chains and find a place in the world they are variously aided and opposed by the novel 's human beings each of whom proves to be a very much distinct creature as well it is a story of violent revolution but also of our turning toward one another from truly different perspectives for the first time engine summer shrugs free of all adventure plot conventions and delivers the first dose of full crowleyan power it 's a shame that this most perfect of books is buried away in genre fiction to be sniffed at absently by seekers of pedestrian escapism now and then but discovered by so few of the millions who would love it the setting is the future again but who cares well crowley in a sense the question here is what remains when all else has passed away a young man chases a lost love and lost civilization across a world of painfully mortal beauty where beauty and pain merge completely we are completely alive we learn words stop there but somehow not crowley 's and then little big
crowley has made a career of being one of the most underrated masters of american fiction only one book little big '' has ever been a modestly big seller his aegypt '' tetrology not yet complete is a piece of visionary work on an epic scale his only fault is that the writing is unclassifiable so it has fallen between every conceivable crack bad for sales engine summer '' is the first of his novels though the last of the early three to be published it leaves the others behind as a work of astonishing originality and almost hallucinogenic vision crowley admits that his first draft was written at a time when he was smoking a lot of well you know in this elegant and beautifully understated work if it goes a little slowly at first stick with it it will sweep you away the crowley themes have a true beginning a world constantly transforming in which the only way that the history of the human as the strangest of races can really be kept alive is through the stories we tell he has an enormous talent for inducing laughter of utter delight and rolling tears simultaneously his gift is in his humanity his innate understanding of the deep pathos and utter ridiculousness of being creatures in a world that is not and will never be wholly comprehensible thus it is our stories that keep us sane barely the future which he envisions this is not the kind of future fantasy that even pretends to forsee the world as it might actually turn out is one in which the split between the natural instinctual half of our human dichotomy and the mental synthetic one actually become separate species with no real capacity to comprehend the other how this plays out through his richly detailed imagination and alchemical control of the engish language is something to be experienced not described the narrative device which leaves us guessing until a breathtaking revelation at the end is alone worth the price get this book read it please the later crowley may be greater but never more brilliantly imagined than this oh yeah beasts '' and the deep '' are mighty fine too
john crowley is a treasure he combines gorgeous haunting writing with a wealth of intelligent ideas otherwise collects his three early novels all nominally science fiction but so far from the stereotypical forms of that genre as to almost deserve their own literary classification in each of these small but perfectly formed jewels crowley demonstrates complete control of his medium in barely 200 pages he creates and destroys worlds makes us fall in love with his characters and leaves us wanting more crowley 's first novel the deep takes place in a world in the throes of a war of succession two factions the reds and the blacks are vying for the throne and another group the just have sworn to end the tyranny of all ruling houses into this war comes a visitor something not entirely human due to injuries or perhaps malfunctions it is unable to carry out its mission and ends up being drawn into human existence there is a dissonance between the two halves of the story the medieval palace intrigue and the visitor 's search for its purpose that keeps the deep from being a complete novel but still one ca n't help but marvel at crowley 's skill other authors writing about elaborate wars of succession and courtly machinations will sometimes fill thousands of pages without creating anything close to crowley 's instantly believable world and sympathetic characters although it is ultimately not a completely successful novel the deep is beautiful and engaging my personal favorite beasts takes place in the not too distant future america has fractured into numerous autonomies which eye each other nervously and prepare for war some decades previously genetic experiments gave rise to hybrids who now walk the earth as outcasts in beasts crowley examines the animal in the human and the human in the animal by assembling a diverse and fascinating cast of characters a messiah and the humans who flock to his call a dog trying to fight his devotion to the race that made him a tame hawk set loose in the wild crowley examines the sword of intelligence and asks is it better to be tame or wild some reviewers have complained about beasts ' sudden ending but to me it seems right as the question can never be answered and there 's already so much in the book to ponder engine summer is my least favorite of the three books its protagonist rush that speaks lives in a world only vaguely aware of the technological society that preceded it driven by wanderlust curiosity and love rush leaves his comfortable home and ventures out into the world through his eyes we discover the different societies and ideologies that have arisen in the wake of some great destruction and eventually rush brings his wisdom to the survivors of that destruction although as beautiful as the other two books in its prose i found engine summer cold and uninvolving there was no plot to speak of and no characters that i could care for otherwise is a good introduction to crowley 's writing although new readers might also begin with little big arguably crowley 's masterpiece these three short novels epitomize his strengths and weaknesses as a writer and clearly demonstrate the promise that he 's since lived up to a reader emerging from the depths of these three worlds can have no doubt john crowley is a treasure
i really am finding this book to be chocked full of valuable information on gettings ones art career in motion i recommend this one for anyone thinking of moving past the hobby stage of their career
wow wow wow get this book ! this has just about everything you need to be professional the only thing i did n't like is that most of the resources listed were geared to nyc residents but there was good direction as to how to locate similar services in your area i especially liked the opening that deals with how artists are helping to perpetuate their own starving artist '' myth and the ways to stop that it made me realize that i am the one standing in the way of my own success ! well no more thanks to caroll i am taking all of the steps listed i wish my graduate school had this information available
this book was really helpful in understanding how much marketing work is involved with doing art it 's a little intimidating to think that you will need to write for everything you do but thats ' the truth i guess if you want to play the game that is if you want to play by and set your own rules instead of just being a tool for the whims of gallerists and dealers
i have never been one to read books but as an artist just beginning to market my work i felt helpless and uninformed i am so glad i bought this book michels demystifies the business process in a pragmatic and often humorous way i now feel i have a clearer picture of where i 'm going and how i 'm going to get there as well as having more confidence in myself and less awe of the art world this book will be as i move forward
i thought this book was helpful in how to write a cover letter and a resume i have n't read the whole book yet but so far it 's decent
this is an absolutely essential book for all artists with all of the nuts and bolts information you need to prceed with art as your full time career the authors attitudes and insights into the myth o f the artist '' are nothing less than inspiring the only criticism i would have is that several of the weblinks in the very extensive appendix are dead including the link for the authors site ! but all in all a must have
book came on time in good condition
everything was fine it arrived very soon
this book is a great basic book for entry into the art business it has alot of good reference materials in the back and good advice
for an artist who is serious about selling my work and making money caroll 's accumulation of contacts facts sources and a collection of years of experience is helping my work enhancement and marketing expertise an artist must pay attention to the experiences of colleagues who have been successful in this business this book provides the tools to make an art career financially productive
in this work paul johnson gives a historical overview of the century from the 1900 's to the 1980 's in this work johnson does n't just recount historical events but also interprets and in many places offers a very strong view on them being both a catholic and a political conservative who strongly believes in the existence of a well to do middle class johnson is searingly scathing of much of century communism as well as socialism and other leftist movements he is also highly critical of many communist dictators such as stalin lenin mao and pohl pot who all effectively wiped out the middle classes in their country and also the revolutionaries like chinua achebe who argued strongly for violence to be used for political ends in the conclusion johnson reserves his poison for the advocates of applying ideas from modern evolutionary biology to social problems feeling this will result in several social disasters however one ca n't help but feel johnson 's catholicism at work here johnson is as usual not afraid to speak his mind when he feels it is right to do so in some works this is a weakness but in this one i feel many of his points are spot on especially when it comes to the awful tyrannies of states who were only too willing to wipe out entire sections of their people for political aims the price of political goals must never be genocide
an extremely entertaining and readable book a pleasing eye for the small detail an efficent prose style he has extreme selective memory the spanish civil war or castro 's cuban revolution with no mention of crushing poverty just one example in some cases he 's flat out wrong cuba a 'rich country ' under batista his dismisal of ghandi smacks of racism in general he has come to praise the colonialist english vichy france franco and nixon to savage fdr jfk and labor unions much of his savaging is monday morning or wednesday afternoon quarterbacking he claims 'moral relativism ' as the scourge of the twentieth century while turning a blind eye when events do n't fit his 'white mans burden ' theory of he blaims leninism for everything but earthquakes and is ruthless in his hatred of state communism state capitalism he swings numbers around to trash labor enough to deserve twain 's over used saw lies damned lies and statistics blind of course to the morally relative shenanigans of reagan and thatcher he does n't come off as a revisionist so much as a self important old man settling old scores take that roosevelt ! while remaining blissfully ignorant of the grey areas around his heros however he can write and he knows his subject with less axes to grind this would be a great book he 's unrelenting in his hatred of the bolsheviks and nazis and as i agree i find much of his analysis very interesting and in many cases accurate there are much better surveys of the century martin gilbert 's comes to mind as his right wing spin does n't kick in until 1968 but for the flavor of the times this is a tasty read just do n't take his opinions or even some of his 'facts ' at face value
paul johnson is opinionated and a good writer and this history is very readable national review '' named it one of the top 100 books of the century and although i 'm not a political conservative i found myself in agreement with much of what johnson says modern times '' begins with the end of world war i and focuses on the personality of actors on history rather than impersonal trends or philosophies of history johnson sums up his own philosophy with a quote from alexander pope the proper study of mankind is man '' his opinion of the century cast of characters is scathing more often than not he trashes woodrow wilson a sound judgment in my opinion defends harding claims coolidge was a good president is lukewarm toward hoover considers roosevelt frivolous and favors truman and adores eisenhower churchill is his great hero the totalitarians lenin stalin and hitler are depicted as venal gangsters johnson is unflinchingly throughout an opinion that proved sound when the rot of the soviet union and its satellites became obvious in the late the first edition of this book was published in 1983 nehru gandhi and many other third world personalities get tossed into the category of with little to recommend them as leaders of countries fault can be found with johnson minor errors of fact and questionable statements dot the book and he rushes breathlessly on without defending many of his opinions however if he argued them all out the book would be pages long and dull as an airline steak knife it is perhaps his tendency to be provocative that makes this history interesting as so many others are not i found particularly informative johnson 's description of how the cold war started and his view that hoover and roosevelt 's policies prolonged the great depression rather than eased it many other interesting gems are hidden in modern times '' read it if you 're a liberal you 'll be infuriated now and then but this is an intelligent and stimulating book about 70 years of the most violent and eventful century in the history of mankind smallchief
this is how history should be written the author thesis that ism '' has been the monkey on mans back for the most of the century is steel on target this book has a lot for one to ponder on
william manchester turned me on to century narrative history with the glory and the dream and the churchill biographies i have been looking for someone comparable for years keegan gilbert schlesenger and others do n't do it for me paul johnson does johnson is not just a lively and entertaining writer like manchester he offers informed judgments and backs them up with facts for anyone wanting to understand today 's dichotomy there is no better tool than century history the state vs the individual socialism vs capitalism central planning vs the markets it 's all there today 's politics is yesterday 's politics nothing is new what 's amazing is that the same ideas keep getting recycled despite the judgment of history perhaps the most sorrowful aspect of today 's society is our historical illiteracy how can you understand the present without an understanding of the past
i 'm trying to read all of johnson 's books because this one was so good some are not available modern times is a sweeping history of the century that should be read by students everywhere armed with the facts they 'd be less prone to falling for historical lunacy later on johnson writes from a point of view as do all writers but his perspective is clear well reasoned and backed by facts he is british and sometimes his national bias shows through but he lays out a history that squares with the perspective that time allows for his histories make sense and more than that his use of the english language is just a marvel paul johnson is the only living writer i 'd care to meet in person i love all his books and keep them on my shelf but this was the one that had the most profound effect on my thinking god bless him i hope he lives to write many more books here 's one yank that has learned much from my favorite british cousin
i was given this book by a friend i am here on amazon to buy 8 copies to give to acquaintances i know will enjoy it as much as i did it 's amazingly and apparently controversial i had to write a review after i read the one that gave the book a low rating though the reviewer admittedly had n't read it there 's a reference to folks like that around page 750 referring to wayward 'intellectuals ' at smith and stanford
accurate history '' is always difficult for reasons that are obvious to anyone that has ever tried to either study it or write about it paul johnson has blended a good balance between presenting the complexities of century history with the relatively simple cause and effect relationship between certain leaders movements and policies and their results on the peoples of the world the author has a moderate conservative bias but he does n't try to hide it like so many authors on both sides of the aisle his research is thorough enough to force one to seriously consider his conclusions all in all this was a very enjoyable interesting and enlightening book and i would recommend it to anyone
night '' is a frightening book written by a man who saw the horrors of the holocaust firsthand elie wiesel survived years of torture malnourishment and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of nazi control he was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again he watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium this book is a scary and very real it is like reading the words of a young boy 's a young boy who is frightened and appalled at the acts of violence taking place around him a boy who can not understand why this is taking place but knows that he must reach for every ounce of courage within him to survive this living nightmare the scenes wiesel describes in this book will stir up all sorts of emotions in every person who reads them adults kids and even young babies are thrown into fire pits by the nazis thirsty prisoners eat snow in the hope that it will provide some thirst quenching relief naked people are forced to sleep without any protection on frigid snowy winter nights wiesel describes the events vividly going from a naive youngster to a hardened prisoner as he is sent from one camp to the next he is sometimes emotional at first but after witnessing so much inhumanity he becomes emotionally numb to the injustice around him the arrival of the allied forces brought an end to the nightmare for elie wiesel and other prisoners wiesel 's family members were not so lucky and he dedicates this book in memory of the three of them he never saw his mother or sister after they were separated from him and his father so there is no way to know how they died no one will ever know exactly how each person perished and the author does n't offer any predictions it really does n't matter at this point anyway his immediate family is gone dead at the hands of a government out of control this book is short but it packs a tremendous punch it serves as a reminder of the potential brutality of some people and it also serves as a tribute to the human spirit a tragic book that is also full of hope showing how one young man was subjected to one of the most terrible human tragedies in history and lived to tell his painful story it 's a powerful read and a page turner from beginning to end
what an honest author he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share
beyond and essential read night speaks to the reader about fundamental questions at the heart of the human condition a powerfully moving autobiography the story of this teenager 's journey through the most horrific death camps of nazi europe strips away discussion of and hatred to present the raw suffering of individual humans stuck in situations beyond their control from the establishment of a ghetto in elie 's home town of sighet the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the holocaust auschwitz buchenwald gleiwitz some of the most infamous places in modern human history rise around elie as we watch him stripped of absolutely everything the reader is swept along helplessly as hitler 's final solution '' unfolds death marches starvation selections full of people torture floggings and as elie is gradually reduced to nothing more than a 'hungry stomach ' what will humans do to survive how important is loyalty trust family faith when one is faced with the grim reaper if we can not even answer these questions ourselves what chance did a old boy stand despite its horrific and subject night '' is an essential read for absolutely everyone something that once read will never be forgotten
this is a disturbing work in that it recounts a man 's experience of the nazi death camps warning this book will shake you up mentally and emotionally it is not for the faint of heart yet it is a must read because of the exposure it gives to humanity at it 's worst and humanity under it 's worst
the short novel night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter but because elie wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character generally considered autobiographical the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only god but his humanity as the nazi machine ravages europe the novel itself deserves 10 stars however the original translation deserves -1. wiesel 's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation the worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted siesta '' as a description of wiesel 's first sleep in the labor camp there is a much better translation out today by marion wiesel and its worth the extra few dollars this book is more than worth reading buy the better translation and you 'll understand why wiesel deserved not just the nobel peace prize but also the literature prize
no matter your religion ethnicity or basic beliefs everyone should read this book because it is about hamanity and how it can change from mundane to total hell for no reason
what more can be said which already has n't of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage with reviews i will not make this an overly elaborate review as the book simply does not require it elie wiesel 's story is one of one man 's courage will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost friends family belongings even basic human dignity what struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men well two men and one boy while he was in one of the concentration camps millions perished but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me his story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale and one of the few books i would call a must read different instances in the book i am quite sure will strike readers differently one of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for god even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man what also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived and the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying i still think would i could i do the same if i was in his terrible position this book shows the worst of mankind and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man 's history since the freeing of elie wiesel we have witnessed rwanda firsthand in the 1990 's and have been told by world authorities that this will never happen again '' yet in modern day sudan and north korea and tibet we see much of the same world turning its back on millions of people there may not be furnaces involved but the crime of complicity through inaction is little different than a world which allowed human beings to be fed into furnaces i guess the final question i come away asking from his book is will mankind ever learn ''
night is wiesel 's personal memoir which relates his personal story before and during world war ii as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps never shall i forget these things even if i am condemned to live as long as god himself never '' i read night in high school and always think of it as being a particularly long book which it is not wiesel manages to pack more than i would think possible into a little over a hundred pages which relates the story of himself and his family during the holocaust it is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story i found the story of wiesel 's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable if you somehow missed this in high school pick it up if you did n't find it again it 's worth it
i always wonder what makes a book a good story to nominate for a pulitzer prize even though i knew night was about the holocaust i still wondered what would make this book a winner my son had a copy of the book and loaned it to me i read it in one sitting and not because it is only about 100 pages long but because i was able to get under the skin of a man who endured unspeakable experiences and survived and found some humanity in all the horror i love the last line of the book priceless
i read michael masterson 's earlytorise at least once a week more when i have time so i thought i had a pretty good idea of what to expect from power persuasion and it did n't disappoint without knowing a lot about masterson 's specific career path i can guess that he 's had a great number of successes in a number of different fields i say that because the ideas and principles that he presents for persuading others seem to transend specific job situations so i can only assume that he 's used them within any business situation in which he 's found himself obviously if you have the ability to persuade others you 'll have a great source of power at your fingertips having never been one to try to browbeat anyone into taking my side in a discussion i look forward to putting the more subtle aspects of masterson 's persuasion techniques to work for me it 'll be interesting to see where i am in a year 's time to see if i have indeed been able to leapfrog up the corporate ladder putting masterson 's power and persuasion to work for me
michael masterson is one of my favorite writers his book power and persuasion '' hits the nail on the head when he describes the characteristics of successful business leaders especially in chapter five he puts into words what i have learned and believed for years i found his thoughts about establishing communication routines and following up on goals to be on target too many leaders try to micromanage their employees and business associates his comments about true delegation and recognizing different expectations of individuals increase both the leader 's power and the power of those they associate it takes very little time to acknowledge someone 's accomplishments while increasing that person 's the result is a strong business team of course a regular routine of firing the weakest performers is best when needed pruning your hierarchy usually strenthens your business and hopefully those individuals will learn from the experience and succeed in another business it is impossible to be liked by everyone but strong leaders are usually respected power and persuasion '' is a must read ! ! ! buy it now ! ! ! i know several leaders who will receive michael masterson 's book as gifts some who already have these skills and some who should learn and practice these successful business traits
i did notice two typos and i 'm deducting a star for that but the book was good an energizing informative series of essays on leadership and communication in business and also in personal matters masterson uses a combination of personal experiences and research to support his arguments and insights most of what he said struck me as true
while i have not finished the entire book i find it ironic that in a book on success and accomplishment there are at least 1 or 2 typographical errors in each chapter while the business concepts appear sound i am concerned about the lack of editing that apparently went into this book i have also read automatic wealth by this author and there were few if any typos
i expected a well written book from masterson and was not disappointed subjects covered from the full spectrum of what it takes to be a great leadser from manners to public speaking to handling a crises or making a decision while i 've read hundreds of books on these subjects i appreciated the fresh approach and had several new ideas while reading all great advice more than a book a compendeum of leadership advice
michael masterson is a genius and the ideas he presented in automatic wealth have changed my life as soon as i heard about the release of power and persusion i ran out and grabbed a copy and was not disappointed in p p michael reveals the 2 universal rules for power and success that the world 's most successful people seem to know and the rest of us missed out on until now concise and extremely informative michael 's p p action plan will have you headed for success in no time i highly recommend this for anyone looking to improve their personal and professional life
michael masterson has had success in many businesses one of them which i am part of so i can tell you first hand how his leadership has had a profound impact on my business and personal life and he has close to early to rise readers who would probably agree if your looking for a leadership book written by silver spoon ceo 's who have never built a business from the gorund up do n't buy this book however if you want actionable leadership advice that you can use in your everyday life masterson is the one who can teach you
in the five years i 've been following michael masterson 's advice my business has gone from an idea '' to an 8 million endeavor with customers 18 loyal employees who surpass every challenge i give them and a very healthy bottom line i credit this success to the persuasion and leadership skills i 've learned from michael masterson i was amazed that he could put all his best strategies and advice in such an format but that 's exactly what he did in power persuasion
this author was recommended to me by a breeder who competes with his dogs in hunting trials the breeder is a firm believer in gentle methods and a trusting relationship however before i ordered the book i read reviews of wolters other books on amazon and was prepared for the worst old fashioned fear based compulsion methods i was wonderfully surprised ! this is one of the finest books on choosing and working with very young puppies i have ever read and i have read many the author 's experience and love of dogs is evident throughout as well as his very clear admonishment of ever being too harsh or pushing any pup past his comfort level in exercises the goal of the exercises with very young dogs is to build trust and confidence in the dog he will become the book is a little dated very little is said about and crate training and if there are any new yorkers still tying their puppies to parking meters outside a store they must not be very bright but i thought the references to women 's lib '' were cute its now very to say that to get the dog you want you are best off with a young good pup instead of an adult rescue but its true spanking '' is also very while the author refers to it he also repeatedly states that no harsh discipline of any sort is appropriate for young pups considering it was written thirty years ago i think its brilliant he was actually saying back then that people confuse dog breeds '' and intelligence '' ! wolter 's experience is obviously tilted toward more eager to please '' breeds most training books are but because the book deals with very young puppies who have n't really developed into the more aloof specimins they may become the advice is still excellent your loving tone may be enough for a middle of the road retriever pup but keeping focus for more independent types may require a treat or two and this can easily be worked into the exercises the author assumes that it is being read by a dog lover who will make loving decisions the format is such that the book must be read not treated like a recipe book where you can just open to chapter sit stay but its a great read and his style is easy and clear the heartbreaking true story of a sweet pup that was subtly pushed too hard should be required reading for anyone working with a puppy and just to be clear the protection '' part of the title means bark like hell and be very scary on command or when strangers approach and nothing more the author feels very few people can handle pets that willingly attack and bite human beings its a good call and very expected from a dog lover who works with the public
a new approach which in fact is so easy but psychologically so difficult to accept we have tried it out and and observed companies doing it since 16 years to design and market low end products for the bottom of the pyramid '' bop with high profit margins at low cost we have developed a tool which we call mmp or multiple market positioning which shows step by step how to implement this bop idea successfully regards peter oertli oec oertli consulting switzerland
tons of information backed by practical means there is a ton of contemporary and useful information statistics charts and analysis in this book equally important are the lists of specific steps and methods to implement these practical ideas in bottom of the pyramid '' prahalid details the critical realities that are witnessed and experienced in our radically changing world today especially for those that are living in ldc nations or those on the lower end of the per capita income scale those that are not experiencing sufficient economic growth bop '' is also quite relevant to high economic growth nations such as china and others as these countries evolve or is that devolve several concepts are examined and advocated in bottom of the pyramid by prahalad mfis and purchasing power parity ppp at the bottom of the pyramid bop are relevant examples of purchasing parity the author 's concept of these populations being value conscious by necessity '' is real as practical as the means to implement these concepts are in this book often aided with specific models examples and instruction it also takes local people to accept it and do it many of the means and methods proposed for these areas at the bop at times seem visionary and and also too prahalid does note the impediments and is realistic about them supplying market needs is helpful to people by providing them access and affordability to the products they need beyond this what can be achieved once these market niches are filled again prahalid uses a lot of charts graphs and stats to outline current challenges and also the specific ways to address them prahalid lists logistics payment methods transportation etc one concept advocated is creating the capacity to consume '' in these poor countries facilitated by the single serving revolution '' this single serving marketing approach is for sales of smaller packages of products instead of larger ones because lower income people in bops ca n't afford to buy larger packages and quantities and put them on the shelf at home for later use good value for a good product with a good ratio some small packaged single servings specifically listed by prahalad are ketchup tea shampoo coffee and aspirin '' trivial products many of us in the world use going farther and beyond these items would help however and prahalid does in addition his concept of the three as '' is realistic in this approach to marketing affordability access availability some of the bureaucratic policies and private industries noted governance the salt industry in india landmines and prosthetics eye care rural kiosks training deliveries and etc prahahlid noted the challenges to implementation ideas and words are quite different from implementation the doing this book 's ideas can be helpful in certain circumstances and in many areas of the world there is opportunity to implement these concepts there are however many hurdles to implementing them and achieving success will people at the bop make the behavioral changes needed changing mentalities is where it starts are these recommendations a form of cultural imperialism to some degree one obstacle is corruption it 's rampant in many of these bop countries a high percentage of aid and investments are stolen throughout the world companies mncs are often squeezed theft corruption and judiciary systems are built to work against foreigners and obstruct them while these bop nations depend upon them ngos acquire and spend a lot of money what do they actually do not much as a whole ngo corruption and embezzlement is endemic aid is used by governments of the developed world '' to push forward its own agenda in these nations aid is a carrot and a stick at the same time in these nations there is no concern for individuals governments of bop nations care about large corporations that dump millions of dollars of fdi into these countries these mncs often flush millions down the drain to get into these nations to get market share reduced and to often export what they produce in bops nations to consumers in highly developed countries outsourcing is the latest motivator for the globalized competitive world where mncs wield enormous power where do the 4 billion people prahalad mentions as living on 2 usd per day fit into this at the boc bottom of the company author prahalid states the process must start with respect for bottom of pyramid consumers as individuals '' consumers target marketing aspirin coffee and shampoo if foreigners can be the saviour how long will they have to stay this sounds like a business oriented financial with the and often ineffective peace corps approach we can do things better than you can so let us come let us in we 're doing you a favor while we 're furthering our interests at the same time mutual benefits to some degree but what is the ratio different parties want access to the pie if the entire pie grows and greater pieces and access of it are available to those who have less those who have nothing or little will in theory get a larger piece of the bigger pie an element of game theory perhaps there are billion people on this planet and the population is contueing to rise rapidly water and food will take prevalence over economic growth if something is not done about it lack of these basic necessities needed for basic survival will obstruct the prospect for economic growth and better quality of life and developed nations plunder world 's the environment and harm the lives of those with less political and economic power we live in one world not three what we do more than ever affects the entire population this is a very positive book with realistic means to achieve its aims ideas facts and realistic methods are superbly tied together in '' bottom of the pyramid '' the biographies at the back of the book add depth to the people involved a highly recommend book for everyone and in particular those in internationally development intl business mncs and government great book
on the one hand this book is endorsed by microsoft 's bill gates and former secretary of state madeleine albright that ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value on the other hand it might be asked what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth after all the poorest people that have any disposable income at all make something like two dollars a day first question then is how big is the market at the bottom of the pyramid bop prahalad writes that china 's per capita gross domestic product of 1000 really represents a dollar purchasing power parity ppp several times that resulting in a dollar economy he sees the indian economy as being worth about in ppp terms 10 it 's easy to see that even the apocryphal two dollars a day '' multiplied by two three or four billion or so results in a whole lot of money the second thing that might be asked is is it really moral for the business world to turn its considerable powers of inducement and persuasion on people who have so little to begin with what kind of person would aim to exploit those least able to afford the exploitation the answer given persuasively by prahalad is that by making products and services available to the poor two good things will happen first is the fact that goods and services hitherto unavailable to the poor will actually become available second these products and services will increase their standard of living and allow them to acquire the dignity of attention and choices from the private sector that were previously reserved for the and rich '' 20 how might this work presently people in the poorest neighborhoods in the world ironically often pay a premium for what little goods and services they get prahalad points out that this is because they are paying a poverty penalty '' which is the result of inefficiencies in access to distribution and because of the role played by local intermediaries '' by local intermediaries '' he means the line of middlemen some traditional some corrupt some both that presently stand between the poor and their products and services these middlemen add no value but have their hands out and therefore artificially increase prices for the people at the bop products using modern distribution methods will undersell the old ways prahalad emphasizes targeting products precisely to the needs of the poor bop people are by necessity '' he argues and contrary to what might be assumed are very '' they are interested in aspiration products '' brand names since these products symbolize a higher standard of living and a better way of life we can see this in our own poor neighborhoods where brand icons like nike and sony are almost worshiped prahalad notes that the poor have unpredictable income streams many subsist on daily wages and tend to make purchases only when they have cash and buy only what they need for that day '' consequently a good marketing strategy is to offer packaging be it shampoo ketchup tea and coffee or aspirin '' this may work i believe if and only if the products that big business makes available to the people at the bop really do improve the quality of their lives if they are persuaded to buy say cigarettes which they would not otherwise buy clearly this will not improve the quality of their lives if they are persuaded to buy soft drinks and other artificial foods '' consisting of empty calories it 's doubtful that they will benefit but is all of this more globalization trickle down '' that is the rich get richer and the poor get well somewhat less poor prahalad believes that turning the people at the bop into consumers will raise their standard of living and in the long run eradicate poverty he uses the phrase creating the capacity to consume '' as a means to this end the unstated assumption behind prahalad 's idea and the consumptive economy in general is that there is great wealth in the world that only needs to be created by human ingenuity and then efficiently distributed by the capabilities of the modern corporation if we can find an energy source as cheap as oil and make a smooth transition to an economy i think there is a good chance that prahalad 's vision will be realized however if we do n't solve the coming energy problem prahalad 's idea will gather dust and decay like so many abandoned suvs alongside roads that we ca n't afford to repair in a sense then this could be a visionary book well ahead of its time
as prahalad explains in his preface he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80 of humanity his approach would mobilize the resources scale and scope of multinational corporations mncs their investment capacity in a partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations ngos in order to formulate and then implement unique '' solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than 2 a day at the bottom of the pyramid '' to which the book 's title refers the process must start with respect for bottom of pyramid consumers as individuals the process of assumes that consumers are equally important joint and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned that is a challenge '' prahalad carefully organizes his material within three parts first he provides a framework for the active engagement of the private sector and suggests a basis for a profitable engagement he identifies all manner of adjustments accommodations and yes sacrifices each of the players '' mncs ngos and the poor themselves must be willing to make to ensure the success of the process next he carefully and eloquently examines 12 case studies which involve a wide variety of businesses each an exemplar of innovative practices where the bop is becoming an active market and bringing benefits far beyond just products to consumers '' all of the companies share the same concern they want to change the face of poverty by bringing to bear a combination of solutions private enterprise solutions and involvement of multiple organizations '' as for part iii it is provided as a cd which consists of 35 minutes of video success stories filmed on location in the bop in india peru mexico brazil and venezuela of special note is the fact that the various stories are told almost entirely from the perspective of bop consumers the poor as prahalad points out they get products and services at an affordable price but more important they get recognition respect and fair treament building and entrepreneurial drive at the bop is probably the most enduring contribution that the private sector can make '' as this book 's subtitle correctly suggests the ultimate objective is to eradicate poverty through profits initiating and then sustaining what will be in fact a engagement of mncs ngos and the poor themselves of special interest to me is what prahalad has to say about innovation for bop markets which must become '' from the consumer 's perspective he identifies and then rigorously examines 12 principles for innovation in those markets such as creating a new price performance envelope '' and education of customers on product usage '' the bop focuses attention on both the objective and subjective performances of the given product or service moreover it must also focus on the need for 30 to 100 times improvements in price performance even if the need is only for 10 to 20 times improvement the challenge is formidable '' although prahalad has a compelling vision he has neither illusions nor delusions about the difficulty of fulfilling that vision when undertaking the new approach '' he recommends in this book his vision is bold indeed of global proportions however his feet are planted firmly on the ground at the bottom of an enormous pyramid one whose complexities are exceeded only by the unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities it offers to help solve the social and economic problems of 80 of humanity given the importance and the urgency of the various issues which prahalad explores so brilliantly in this book there seem to be no acceptable alternatives to the approach he proposes those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out vijay mahajan and kamini banga 's the 86 percent solution how to succeed in the biggest market opportunity of the next 50 years and kenichi ohmae 's the next global stage the challenges and opportunities in our borderless world
what is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models distribution channels product development or business grown up and worked in india in the mid it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued however the case studies suggest this has changed and in many ways as far as india is concerned this is visible by strong anecdotal evidence also in many ways there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people have realised that the government will not solve all that makes doing business difficult and have been using this kind of thinking as a driver for entrepreneurial business which also have a positive impact on the people at the bottom of the pyramid will the framework and ideas apply in all developing economies specially with smaller populations this question is harder to answer and no doubt time will tell
this is a well researched book in which prahalad explores how disruptive innovation if harnessed properly can lead to huge profits for the corporations involved and high impact social well being the key however is to get the ground breaking idea there is no set approach to getting the same but he has done a good job of explaining how the idea can be scaled the book will be phenomenonal if it could have concrete numbers and a comparative analysis of what the value add was by each idea certain approaches for decreasing costs etc are explained but the lack of numbers hurts all in all a great read mayank
this is a fantastic book ! 112 pages of theory and advice that really makes sense you easily internalize the message ! this is then followed by 5 very thorough and down to the detailed examples of how the theory has been practised by fore running companies in the field of world integration it is very illustrative and initiate thoughts on how this could be followed up in your own compan
this is the intense profound almost unbearably sad story of swede levov brought to life in the audio version by a performance by ron silver the swede was the hero of narrator nathan zuckerman 's youth the household apollo of the weequahic new jersey jews '' the swede 's blond good looks and athletic prowess became the repository of all their hopes '' and allowed the neighborhood to forget the war to zuckerman the swede had been the embodiment of the hero of his favorite childhood book the kid from tomkinsville '' the kid was a star ball player a modest serious chaste loyal naive undiscourageable courageous '' boy who in the final pages of the book was struck down on the field and carried off inert through the mob on a stretcher zuckerman had secretly viewed this story as an augur of the swede 's own life zuckerman had wondered if it had occurred to the swede that if disaster could come and strike down the kid from tomkinsville it could come and strike the great swede down too '' the swede 's mythic power stays with zuckerman throughout his life years later out of the blue the swede contacts zuckerman now a renowed writer and invites him to dinner ostensibly to talk about the swede 's father zuckerman accepts the invitation but is incredibly disappointed in how the swede has turned out although he still had the face and physique of a god the swede seems to be almost unbearably bland every word from his mouth is good natured and unobjectionable zuckerman sadly concludes that the swede has turned out to be the embodiment of nothing '' but soon finds out that his assessment of the swede is wrong a few months after the dinner zuckerman runs into the swede 's younger brother jerry at their high school reunion jerry reveals that an unbelievable unthinkable tragedy had befallen the swede years before and the horror of that event had destroyed the swede 's life for the rest of the book zuckerman explores the brutality of the destruction of this indestructible man '' zuckerman imagines the swede 's internal life over the course of a the swede 's story unfolds in a spiralling structure that goes back and forth through time as the swede obsessively tries to make sense of the inexplicable through the swede 's ruminations roth explores incredibly weighty themes a parent 's love for a child the nature of perfection the randomness of life the delusion of control and moderation and the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to figure out why things are most of all roth seems to struggle with the notion that there can not be depth without suffering and that without that depth life would be meaningless you get the feeling that roth wishes he could appreciate the ordinary guy the bland honorable decent people who live their lives with relative equilibrium roth seems to regret that it is only the swede 's tragedy that makes him interesting and that it is only in imagining the swede 's excrutiating pain that roth can identify with him overall the book 's tone is intense and dark but there are moments of humor that are funnier than just about anything i 've ever read roth 's description of the valentine 's gift that the jerry makes for his secret crush had me laughing for days
the first of this novel are absolutely captivating and unputdowanably '' good and yet just when i thought it was about to get even better roth shifts gears and peels away another layer of the onion to show us these people and their friends and family through the main character 's eyes while eventually the story picks up again this radical shift took away some of the enjoyment for me nevertheless roth is his typically excellent self here providing great prose excellent character development and a gripping plot the nathan zuckerman character does n't play as much of a role in this novel as he did in say the human stain here it 's frankly an unnecessary device even though it does n't get in the way of enjoyment my only quibble is that i was far more interested in merry the main character 's daughter than in the range of emotions swede levov the main character experiences i wanted to see merry more especially as she was doing seeing thinking and ultimately developing into the radical protester she would become instead it is all given to us second hand from swede 's discoveries and we experience his emotional turmoil instead of hers true to life in that way i suppose as few of us really experience the center of the storm we mostly hear about others doing so still
i just finished reading american pastoral my first book by philip roth since it is my first roth i think i provide an unbiased perspective i know he has written some other stuff but my mind has not yet been corrupted by it ok so what is my opinion of american pastoral for starters i think the style is a lot like that of joseph conrad in lord jim the only conrad i have read there are pages upon pages of diversions from the main plot lengthy descriptions of people sitting around at dinner tables single events that are analyzed and from every possible angle and then again this type of literature is often fascinating but can quickly become tiresome so i am not surprised that some of the amazon reviewers were not able to finish the book as far as readability is concerned this book gets a delicious in places starchy in others now what about the main point that roth is trying to make he wants to tell us something fundamental about the man he wants us to our concept of the successful american he wants us to examine the american dream closely and see what lies beneath its surface he wants us to look behind the facade of beauty pageants and country clubs and face lifts and little league and white teeth and football and big muscles and all that other good stuff we cherish about america in this book roth tries to lift the veil and show us the real america is he successful sort of for example the fetid mess that propels swede toward insanity is masterfully portrayed the mental breakdown of our hero is wonderfully choreographed the hero 's slow descent into hell is captured page by page in exquisite detail however depsite all this terrific stuff i came away with the odd notion that roth himself may be slightly out of touch this book is clearly written from the perspective of an older generation the younger generation is seen as infantile petulant irksome depraved and so forth adolesence to roth apparently has few redeeming features youth exists simply to torment the elderly the establishment roth and his cast of bittersweet characters are sadly on the wrong side of the hill i do n't want to say that roth comes off looking like a grumpy old man so i wo n't say it i 'll just think it lesson i learned from reading this book if you are lucky enough to get a chance to live the american dream live it by all means ! enjoy ! but if you do decide you want to live the american dream go in with your eyes wide open the american dream is more complicated than it looks ! read the book if you have already lived your american dream and you want to compare notes with somebody else who has been there done that too pass on this book if you are youthful optimistic and your dream is still alive you can always read this book afterward once things settle comfortably down and you want to reflect on what it all meant
i am not a fan of using the same protagonist in many novels i tend to think that it 's a result either of laziness on the part of the author the protagonist being so close to his own voice that to strike out with another character would be too difficult or the desire to cash in on the success of previous novels with the same character i put those issues aside to read this book anyway and i was very happy that i did thankfully there was no need to be familiar with the other books the details in this book of the politics of zuckerman 's youth the glove factory and the anguish at losing his daughter to the world make this a great novel i have a terrible memory for the characters and events of stories but this one remains with me i 've added several other of roth 's book to my future reading list
this astonishingly insightful tragedy shows the unreliable outcome that can stem from almost any all of our american contemporary civil virtues demonstrating that outcomes ca n't be predicted from input the structure of the book convincingly shows us the the swede '' first as a fortunate simpleton hiding the intense tragedy of his life and his spirit later we find that seymour is overwhelmed by the failure of his own efforts to save his daughter his community his family and his profound decency the reader suffers along with the character as he simply refuses to save himself from the mystery pain and layered consequences of an explosive event that consumes all he loves the portrayal betrayal is told in entirely convincing prose with flawless ethnic insight and painfully realistic anguish reading this was overwhelming
i had my doubts about this book i am a professional dog trainer and a animal behaviorist i would not recommened this book for your average reader however it covers the basics of canine behavior very well and i would recommend it to anyone who trains dogs or works with groups of dogs and wants a deeper understanding of their social interactions reads a bit on the scientific side so if your reading for entertainment you will probably be bored if your reading to learn and increase your knowledge you will probably enjoy
i doubt that some of the examples were true to life some dogs were at first presented as knowing as much as a 3 year old human child these dogs were presented as responding to long sentences and did things that dogs just can not do then the book analysed these impossible canine responses and i do not accept the book 's analysis these fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts however the material presented seems sound enough in principal i guess the author was taking artistic license to amplify the points of his thesis whatever it does n't matter this book does support many of my own observations and has given me insight into dog behavior that i was not yet aware i am 67 a lifetime dog owner who spent a year working full time for a veterinarian when i was 17 and presently have a 5 year german shepherd if you are a typical dog owner you will gain much from this book
i do n't agree with all that he says but it is all interesting lots of information to integrate with practical learning
i have a special needs '' dog and i have been searching for a book that will give me practical ways to work with her this book has given me a lot of helpful information without reiterating the obvious great find !
while i ca n't pretend to have gotten inside the mind of stanley coren i am willing to speculate that he wrote this book as a way of taking a very specific scientific controversy out of the realm of academia and bringing it to the people the controversy do dogs have a true language or do they not having recently rewatched miracle on street i recall kris kringle 's attorney 's comment on the controversy over belief in santa clause some firmly believe in him others just as strongly deny his existence '' in keeping with the spirit of the season when we 're a little more likely than usual to believe that animals speak it 's a great time to buy this book as a present for a serious dog lover on your list it seems obvious to me that coren takes the controversy seriously taking it to the people is not a cop out rather his singular achievement is to bring a body of evidence if you will to pet owners who normally would not be part of this academic jury while reading how to speak dog again and again i 'd find myself exclaiming wow that 's oliver 's call to be let in or so that 's what emmie is saying to hannah '' after completing my first read i kept the book on the end table having dog eared sorry could n't resist the section entitled doggish phrase book '' this dictionary is a for your next visit to the park where doggish is the language of the land stanley may i call you stanley has organized the phrasebook by sounds and by ear eye facial tail and other body signals then for each phrase he provides the human meaning corresponding emotions and conditions of the dog when the phrase is uttered basically this is what the dog is saying when you see and hear this behavior '' often for weeks after i finished the book whenever i 'd hear a bark a whine a howl or see a crooked tail i 'd pop open the phrase book and compare coren 's interpretation to my own i 've often found myself recommending this book to friends psychologists and other dog lovers as a sociologist myself i 've always been interested in cross cultural communication over time little by little i came to realize i 'd become even more interested in communication between people and dogs progress has been slow i guess it 's hard to study cultural differences when you do n't understand the language but i digress so back to the basic question oh yes '' stanley concludes dogs have a language there are four generally accepted key requirements for language and dogs show all four one to a lesser extent than the other three meaningfulness canine sounds and signals are not random but convey a specific meaning displacement the ability to target things not currently in sight go get the ball in the kitchen '' display rules of combination some combinations are not meaningful when used together dogs do n't lay down to get a tummy rub and seriously growl at the same time productivity the ability to put words together in novel ways stanley acknowledges that productivity is weak though it does exist in doggish but the same is true in human toddlers and few would argue that toddlers have no language just that they understand far more than they can express in words so while at this time of year i 'm especially willing to believe in santa i find that all year long i 'm willing to believe dogs have a language thanks stanley i wo n't be surprised if my peers in the jury decide to vote the same yes virginia dogs do have language
this book was not only full of information it was fun to read also ! ! it gave alot of the background of todays canine which is important to know in order to understand what your dog is saying '' wonderful book ! ! i recommend it to anyone who has a dog or wants a dog or just likes learning about dogs !
as a lover of dogs for over 50 years i own dozens of books about canine care and behavior but stanley coren 's 'how to speak dog ' is definitely my favorite i originally found this informative dog communication book in my local library after adopting a lovable but fearful mixed breed from my local humane society five years ago since then i have bought at least six copies of this same book online just to have on hand to give to friends and family who decide to bring a dog into their life or who do n't understand the behavior of a dog already living with them i especially like the book 's detailed descriptions of a dog 's specific body language ears eyes mouth tail and what each means as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way not unlike a driver 's training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers 'how to speak dog '' should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog
very good book very informative easy to read and easy to learn from i would recommend this for anyone working with dogs in any capacity and for those who just want to have better comunication with their dog
very well written it connected a lot of dots for both my wife myself bringing better understanding about us as well as our dog friends we 've always believed that when you train your dog you also are training yourself we have loved all of our 'friends ' that have shared their lives with us are just now beginning a new bond with our third dalmatian puppy anyone that has had any experience around this breed knows the special aura they wear this book is a 'must read ' for you sincerely john steen sr

provides a wonderful outline and schedule for getting into or maintaining the habit of daily prayer and devotions the themes that permeate this book are worship forgiveness and servanthood this is a great tool to grow with
i 've used this book for about two years as a simple predictable structure for prayer and bible reading each week new area or faith is explored following the lectionary used in most churches today a simple invocation or opening prayer is presented followed by a psalm reading next is a reading on the subject which is borrowed from other resources these readings cross all boundaries in terms of geography and date written followed by a scripture reading next is a time of reflection where one is encouraged to journal and reflect upon the topic in light of the information presented from man and the word next is prayer time a hymn and a closing prayer a weekly recipe '' with some ingredients provided the book has a life span of 4 years with the current edition
december 1986 my family presented me with this book i enjoy readings of william barclay dietrich bonhoeffer elizabeth barrett browning carlo carretto richard foster carl jung lewis henri nouwen mother teresa elton trueblood john wesley to name a few but to have writings by these great authors compiled in one book is unimaginable on top of that there are the lyrics of some of the most well known and loved hymns included in this book there are monthly retreat models that can be done individually or with a group the story a doll of salt '' by anthony bloom is a wonderful simile of our developing relationship with god i have highlighted written in the margins and dogeared so many pages that i had to get a second copy because the first one is falling apart and it was the leather bound copy the readings are so inspiring and uplifting as well as thought provoking for the layperson as well as the ordained minister if you are going to get this book i encourage you to get the leather bound for you will discover you will use it on a daily basis along with your bible
this book was easy to read and divided into segments that allowed for access i have referred to it numerous times since i received it and would recommend it to those homeschool parents facing the teen years the best part of the book was the resources at the end of each section it helped me see what parts in our curriculum needed improvement and which parts were right on target
this is the second book i have read from cafi cohen i find her writing straightforward exciting and relaxing at the same time this book contains lots of good resource information which can appeal to all sorts of homeschoolers i am pleased that cafi cohen writes with regard to all homeschoolers not just religious ones unlike some other authors cohen does not pepper her writing with her own religious beliefs

catch me if you can '' follows the life of frank abignale one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was this book is the autobiographical account of abignale 's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father 's mobil credit card there are so many times in this book that i had to step back and think about the air of confidence that abignale displayed yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him some of the stories are absolutely outrageous i loved them all ! this book also talks about his time in prison across seas in europe and how terrible he was treated in the french prisons if you liked the movie then you should definately read this book it further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie a must read
this book was very well written and so much fun to read frank abagnale tells his story with the same flare and finesse that he pulled off the cons of his criminal career entertaining from start to finish
we all know of frank abagnale 's personality arrogant yet kind with class among all the different characters that he chooses to play whether he 's a pilot doctor lawyer or a college professor i believe that frank is somewhat confused of who he is frank ran away '' from home at 16 the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school at 16 most people do n't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future one thing was for sure frank wanted money and women i believe frank 's unique personality came from the way he was brought up having endured his parent 's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him it all started with his father frank abagnale during the process of his 's parent 's divorce his father still loved is mother so frank would try to get his son to say things like talk to her son tell her i love her tell her we 'd be happier if we all lived together tell her you 'd be happier if she came home that all you kids would be happier '' his jr 's father led him to the first step of manipulation frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce since his father was quite a rich man he had a whole variety of rich friends and frank would come in contact with his friends quite often this is where frank learned the attitude of the rich '' with confidence finally when frank did his first con with his father 's money frank forgave him look son if you 'll tell us how you did this and why we 'll forget it there 'll be no punishments and i 'll pay the bills '' frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment he did n't believe this to be a huge mistake with confidence manipulation some class and little fear of breaking the law we come to frank abagnale jr
frank abagnale stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time the story is inflated at times in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with still the catch me if you can is engaging and abignale 's scams combine inventiveness and good humor enjoy
if you like me have seen the film with leonardo dicaprio and tom hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book you are reading the right review ! if you were in front of me i would look at you with a grin as if to show that i knew something you did n't and encourage you to do so frank abagnale is less likable in the book which is to be expected but is still far from what we would consider a true villain it caught me by surprise about halfway through how i was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values i suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy overall a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more
i read this book after watching the movie staring tom hanks and leonardo dicaprio before i started i knew i liked the story but i did n't realize how much i loved reading abagnale 's account of his life of crime i enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot a doctor a professor and a lawyer i also liked the novel 's open frankness about the author 's misdeeds however i thought the book was not especially well written abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion i also felt somewhat deprived with the novel 's ending frank abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story i would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right all in all i would recommend this book as an easy weekend read
many people became aware of frank abagnale jr 's story until the movie starring tom hanks and leonardo dicapprio was released even though an earlier movie based on this story was released while not as flowing as the movie the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life containing many of abagnale 's earlier mistakes lessons we do n't get to see in the movie on the other hand many parts of it do seem to be missing such as why air france would take such an interest in catching frank even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly american based this is an interesting read as a background to the movie and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie 's major storylines
not a reader of fiction fantasy therefore picked up a copy of catch me if you can '' from a bookstore yesterday seen the film more than loved the film loved the characters loved the plot loved the book even more ca n't put it down the story just flows perfectly makes you wonder what franky can do at the age of etc a real inspiration the book 's plot is better than the movie would have been great to read it before watching the still good to read it after watching the overall it 's a great book finished it in a da
ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture
first i want to say that this is the paperback version of the cooks illustrated complete book of poultry different title different cover design this is a great book especially for those who eat a lot of chicken and are looking for a variety of ways to prepare it like me there are recipes for dishes from many different traditions which i like and all are tasty if you look at the table of contents you 'll see that they are arranged by cooking method which is handy and the book has all the explanations and clear directions typical of cooks illustrated books my absolutely only complaint is that i appreciate it when an entire recipe is printed across two open pages so i can put it in my cookbook stand and leave it there and that is not the case here i have to turn the page but that 's minor highly recommended
this is the sort of cookbook that grows with you if you 're a novice cook or you cook only because you have to put something on the table every night you will find this book enlarges the number of chicken dishes you can put on the table without much fuss each chapter suggests several variations so you can adapt to what you have on hand or what 's fresh at the store there are also handy chapters on soup leftovers and turkey breasts if you 're a more seasoned or adventurous you 'd like to become one ! will appreciate the scope of the book which provides basic recipes in 37 chapters including what to do with duck goose quail squab and pheasant with a proven method '' at hand you can experiment with seasonings vegetables and feel confident that your new creation will at least be edible or if you prefer to stick to the book there are more complex dishes here such as sauted butterflied chicken with tomato olive and caper pan sauce and grilled squab with red seed sauce if you like america 's test kitchen or cook 's illustrated this book is a guaranteed winner even if that 's not you style you might find the abundance of recipes makes this a winner anyways best of all it 's affordable
the books are indeed a masterpiece collection of sorts very racy and laced with black humor and the sort of a plot which you can put into a perspective for instance the reference to mob psychology harks about to blacks in 1930 's america to many such instances in third world countries like india and pakistan where many a woman child and man have been victimc of such outbursts born out of sheer greed or religious intolerance for instance there is a muslim religious leader in australia saying that women invite rape by exposing their body parts wow ! count olaf indeed ! the writer is not shedding tears for the children here or is presenting a bleak picture for us to salivate on but is really afraid for us and trying to make us careful in our decisions and largely he is trying most explicitly to say that a family should bond well together for all other relationships are transitory a very practical one ! should i say !
plot interesting suspence present entertainment keep hidden messages a few book ranking for series mysteries hospital related only
dear reader unlike previous books in the series the hostile hospital takes place immediately after the vile village the three baudelaire children are all alone walking across a large empty space when the reach the last chance general store the children had just escaped from the evening before and were now wanted by the police for the murder of jacques snicket and misrepresentations of the deeds were going to appear in the morning edition of the daily punctilio hungry and without another chance in the world the children enter the last chance it 's too terrible to describe what horrors are inflicted upon them there somehow the escape and make their way to the heimlich hospital where they join with a group of singing people known as the volunteers fighting disease it 's not the that their parents were members of but this inadvertently assist the baudelaire 's in finding new information about their parents oh my but that was before violet was captured by count olaf before she was supposed to have her head removed and before a major fire oh those poor children ! i ca n't write about them anymore at the moment read about them yourself i think i 'll go buy a balloon to make me feel better because my stomach feels queasy sincerely uncle t
the first seven books of a series of unfortunate events followed the same formula the baudelaire orphans are with the banker poe until he can find a new relative willing to care for the siblings things go badly and the evil count olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance in the end they get away and olaf is on the run from the authorities the ending of the vile village changes this the baudelaires are on the run suspected of the murder of count olaf despite the fact that he is n't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the crime the hostile hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about vfd the quagmire triplets and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop count olaf from coming after them ever again this time there is no poe and no new distant relative to live with count olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action author lemony snicket an assumed name as the author is as much a character in the story as the baudelaires are does an excellent job in presenting the story of the baudelaires experiences at a hospital trying to research in the records room what the truth behind the events of the past several novels and once more running afoul of the minions of count olaf and being placed into mortal danger once again snicket sets up the next volume very well and tells the story in such a way that the novel flows into the next book while telling an independent story at the same time the breaking of the formula of the series is a refreshing change and spices up the action quite a bit the hostile hospital is one of the best of the first eight volumes in this series sherr
this book is a concise well written guide to the core issues of buying owning and selling multifamily buildings it was extremely valuable in evaluating our first purchase of a structure
as a real estate investor and author myself i read a lot of real estate books many if not most are written by folks who do not invest in real estate themselves they only write about it berges is not one of them he knows his stuff and it 's clear that he practices what he preaches i have read three of his books and i must say he 's one of my favorite real estate authors you can trust what he says experienced investors may want a bit more detail from steve but what he does say is accurate and safe this is a good book on buying apartments in fact in my own book investing in duplexes triplexes quads '' i list the best books i 've read on different areas of real estate this book is the only book i recommend on investing in commercial multifamily ie apartments of 5 units and up properties having given those accolades here are a few of my constructive criticisms 1. on pages 37 and 38 steve gives nice charts illustrating the financial benefits of investing in multifamily properties on page 39 however there is an error in referring to the big numbers shown the reference is made to investor a 's equity '' of 2.1 million and investor b 's the multifamily property investor equity of 92 million i just do n't think steve caught this but those numbers do n't refer to the investor 's equity but to the fair market value of his collective assets his properties the investor 's equity might be in the range of 20 of that i do like the charts however and i used a similar analysis in my recent book one other note on the charts they presume selling and buying exactly at the end of one year a difficult task as steve would surely admit on average i think 18 months to two years is a better time frame for flipping apartments 2. refinancing steve did n't give a chart showing the effect of the buy hold and refy '' strategy using proceeds to buy again but retaining the first property in addition steve only mentioned the general banking guideline that you can only pull out cash up to 80 of the new appraised value the bank has an ltv of 80 however you can get around this i 've done it it requires a second lender giving a second mortgage with a cltv combined loan to value of up to 90 as such you can pull out much more cash 3. grm gross rent multiplier in his financial analysis section steve does n't give much detail or provide real life examples on this crucial analysis factor granted the cap rate is the analysis primarily used for commercial real estate while the grm is the one used for residential multifamily units real estate since many owners and selling brokers will fudge '' on expenses a cap rate can be very hard to verify the grm however is fairly simple just look at the lease agreements 4. lack of coverage on residential multifamily apartments in fact this is why i wrote my book on this topic if steve had covered it here i would not have written mine i like steve 's writing style and he knows his stuff but for investing in small multifamily properties certainly on residential but probably up to about 10 units we really have to cover valuation and selection of properties using the grm that and i felt like the buy hold and refy '' strategy needed much more coverage but for investing in commercial multifamily properties i recommend this book as the only good one on the market larry loftis author investing in duplexes triplexes and quads the fastest and safest way to real estate wealth
excellent and reasonably comprehensive introduction to the business of investing in multifamily properties
this is the second steve berges book that i 've read i read his book the complete guide to real estate investing '' he focused on obtaining value once you make the purchase that is very sound advice with so many people investing in property hoping to make a profit after they fix it steve urges you to pursue profitability prior to making any modifications do not pursue property that requires capital investment or upgrades prior to a positive cash flow that 's very basic but sage advice
this was the first book i have purchased on the subject of real estate investing in properties i have been and interested in the subject for some time however i found the formulas and rules the book includes to be invaluable and used them to create excel spreadsheets to quickly analyze the hundreds of listings available i found the book to be easy to read and understand
this book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world for anyone that has already dealt with multi family then you do not need this book however berges other book real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner in that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties the book covers the general ideas behind multi family properties but of course it will differ by region slightly the cap rates that he speaks of are not available in say california but might be available in indiana overall a good book for beginners to intermediate but definitely not seasoned investors
out of all of the real estate books i 've read over the years this is by far one of the better ones the author stays focused on the topic of buying and selling apartments and does it in a way that is easy to understand let me emphasize that when i say the book is easy to understand that is not meant to imply that only the basics are covered not only does berges do a great job of explaining the mechanics of the process but he also mixes in a lot of personal examples which help the reader to connect the dots between theory and real world applications steve berges concludes the book with an inspiring and motivational chapter he refers to as the 5 keys to success which he points out are not limited to just real estate but can be applied to any business or profession as well as to one 's personal life i thought this section was very well written and gave me cause to reflect on my own course in life i 've read several of the author 's other books as well all of which were good but i particularly enjoyed the complete guide to real estate finance for investment properties wow what a great read ! it 's about time somebody wrote a book that really deals with the financial aspects of real estate see my review
the author berges provides unique insight into investing in apartment buildings there is n't much written about this topic and what is seems to be very generic this book however provided lots of good examples with specific advice on what to do and what not to do in addition berges sprinkles various tidbits of information throughout the book that while not directly related to real estate are nevertheless quite relevant to being successful in it i just finished another book of his the complete guide to investing in rental properties which i also found to be very enjoyable
i found this book to be an excellent primer '' for the novice investor who wants to learn about the basics of investing in mutual funds bogle describes the various types of mutual funds in simple plain language
i first became interested in this title because of the positive review by warren buffett there 's so much hype in the investing field that you 'll save hundreds of hours of wasted time and thousands of dollars in lost money by consulting a genius to separate the wheat from the chaff it 's not always an exciting easy read but it 's essential knowledge if you 're investing or planning to invest in funds its simple concepts that take some mental work to understand those that make big money in individual stock investing normally invest a tremendous amount of time understanding their field and the particular companies they 're risking their money on if you do n't have the time or inclination to do this mutual funds are one safe way to go for my money your number one investment is in becoming valuable in whatever field you have a passion for after enough money starts flowing and you want a relatively safe approach to investing and compounding excess funds above what you need for a comfortable not extravagant lifestyle bogle explains the simple concepts for compounding your money over time do n't take my word for it read the back page of the book for the brilliant investing minds that have given bogle 's ideas their stamp of approval
my first and final book on mutual funds i 've read several others but keep returning to this one the end of chapter summaries are invaluable it is a tougher read than most and mutual funds for dummies ins easier and in the same vein
i read this book when it first came out ten years ago at the beginning of the bull market at the time the book had mixed reviews one of bogle 's warning and probably the best advice is to watch out for funds that charge high fees and to study all the fees charged in all funds i remember one reviewer feeling that bogle was overreacting to the fees that funds charged and that fund managers are really on our side to today we have the mutual fund scandal and we learn that mutual fund managers are n't really working on our best interests though reading this book ca n't help you spot all the bad apples the janus family has alot of funds and it was implicated in the scandal it can help you be aware and thus be more weary in a nutshell this book is comprehensive honest and prescient john bogle is the conscience of the mutual fund industry
bogle provides an excellent guide to the world of mutual funds he begins with an introduction to three primary classes of investments namely stocks bonds and cash reserves and goes on to provide an excellent insight into analysing and selecting a mutual fund a must read for anyone who has invested or is planning to invest in mutual funds
most of the reviews that i have written for amazon are based on the books the dvds and the cds that i already own i occasionally buy a new product via amazon but i mostly review the stuff that i already own i own this book this play because i read it while in a humanities course in college i went to college rather late '' in life whatever that means and yet i derived more from the experience than i probably would have had i gone right after high school i am one of those people who believe that it 's not college that makes a '' indivividual but life experience if colleges and universities handed out degrees based on life experience i 'd probably have a doctorate three times over we were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college i was attending just so happened to be putting on with my primary focus being on philosphy i embraced the existentialism unit that we were now focused upon my best friend who an atheist '' was less receptive of these existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive you think he being an atheist would have been more open to them than i who had already been bitten by the plague truth be told i think the only reason he says he 's an atheist is because he 's a cheapskate and does n't want to shell out extra money for christmas gifts so we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated in this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and i noticed how we as a society love our answers we are not soothed by questions and proposistions and what if '' scenarios we feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing is n't it the existentialists believe that the universe is random chaotic and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they give '' meaning to meaninglessness just like an atheist believes in you see the human species can not not give meaning to life we can not not believe we can pretend '' that life is without meaning and that we do n't believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception will take on the shape of our perceptions i loved this play i loved the type dialouge is n't this what we all do we get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it 's valid what i have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it it does n't make us more right '' than the person who does n't believe it it just makes us believers of the belief and contrary to popular opinion the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it 's any more valid than if only one person believed it this play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make samuel beckett gag it made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only i can live nobody lives by proxy each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs the best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time this is why it 's a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe you may have outgrown certain beliefs certain ideas certain ways of being in the world but do n't be like the two bums '' in the play do n't keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see see it now live it now be it now if you are going to be an atheist be the best atheist you can be if you are going to be a christian be the best christian you can be if you are going to be an anarchist be the best anarchist you can be just do n't think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and do n't make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view in the end none of us truly know what 's on the other side yes we 've had people with near death experiences but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report we just have reports from people who have been mostly dead '' take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride peace blessings
waiting for godot was dubbed a tragicomedy '' and there does n't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play the random and wandering personalities of vladimir and estragon the main characters lend an amusing air to the entire work however their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy and irritation though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you unless one goes into waiting for godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be knowing a little bit about beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own what i love the most about this book is beckett 's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality vladimir and estragon are most certainly not your average joe but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous waiting for gogot is really what you make it because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale go in looking for a meaning and knowing how beckett means to get things across and i think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold a short read and worthwhile i would say at least for its originality and humor
samuel beckett 's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them is godot god are didi and gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering waiting for godot in proper modernist fashion strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play which beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic but the play 's power does n't really come from that rather what makes waiting for godot so compelling is its wide applicability it 's a story about random oppression brutality and dreams deferred by harsh realities it has been performed as an allegory of apartheid south african the jim crow south the horror of the war in bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable why because as benjamin kunkel pointed out in a piece in the new yorker not so long ago n ot everyone has a god but who does n't have a godot '' beyond the metaphysical implications of the play though it 's popularity stems from its for all the philosophical meaning people see in it the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action take the infamous opening estragon the first of the tramps struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot unable to get it off he gives up and announces nothing to be done '' vladimir wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play 's running jokes is vladimir 's venereal disease which causes him immense pain when urinating thinks estragon is commenting on his own ailment and announces i 'm beginning to come round to that conclusion myself all my life i 've put it from me saying vladimir be reasonable you have n't yet tried everything ! and i resumed the struggle '' on the one hand the lines relate concretely to the action of the play on the other they have become representative of modern man 's ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world and such clever cynicism has linked beckett to the french existentialists in whose circles he moved after the second world war but seen merely as declamatory statements of cynicism the lines lose all their power beckett 's achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical play steve martin who played vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the lincoln center in new york put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not that 's a lesson which sadly precious few theater directors seem to grasp but which the careful reader discovers in beckett definitely a but read it before seeing it because few productions do it justice
some think waiting for godot is an argument for existentialism others believe it is about man 's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question neither seem correct in short this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language to strip life down to a mere game of waiting that is in essence what this is all about we have two characters vladimir and estragon who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up they do n't know why they do n't know exactly when he will be there still they wait eternally by the tree by wherever they think he said he would show this is n't an absurdist play although it has been labeled as such absurdism though seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece we oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story but with waiting for godot we have a simple theme waiting the two characters symbolize nothing they are quite simply not waiting to be analyzed they become in effect victims of samuel beckett 's own game they are his quotation and he only says what needed to be said at the time and so he wrote it whether people would catch on or not whether they would label it absurdism or not if you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud very slowly word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion you would probably capture the idea if it 's any indication he wrote everything in french first his second language and then translated it in to english just so it can be simple i do n't assume of course that this work should be cherished simply because it 's an exercise in simplicity but i submit that it should be cherished because it 's a genuine themeless somehow masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant unknown thing that may or may not ever come it is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous but somehow it manages to charm it is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again and it has no lyrics and no meaning as far as you know but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity
waiting for godot is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value in this case however what is behind the artwork is a the impossibility of creating a masterpiece after the monumental impossibility of joyce 's finnegans wake what remains for the serious artist waiting for godot is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world in that sense this play is the last masterpiece of high art '' the torch has now passed to movies and popular forms many critics have tried to convince us that waiting for godot is very funny and entertaining i remain skeptical there are a few moments of wry humor but not enough to make up for the emptiness of waiting '' there is literally nothing to be done '' in this play waiting '' is a what 's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant there 's something like an alienation effect '' or a defamiliarization '' as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful why is there nothing to be done '' is it simply because it 's all been done before or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning in many ways waiting for godot is a reaction to the holocaust and hiroshima the characters who have something to do '' in this play are pozzo and lucky who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world
samuel beckett 's soon to be classic drama about two men vlad and estro transcends drama beckett 's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic literal story most drama should be seen on stage so that the performers can give their characters shape bring in an audience and produce a night of dramatic arts that is not how this story seems to go not at all indeed beckett 's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor here are two men both obviously at the end of their ropes but each keeps this asinine hope that godot '' will show up but he never does extra characters like pozzo and lucky simply add to the intended confusion as several previous reviewers have taken note there is not action while this idea is spurred by the threepenny opera '' beckett takes postmodernism another step further the characters ' are so disillusioned the question becomes godot is n't coming so did he ever care could godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state a fantastic read and one of the best dramas ever written this fairly short play should be read by everyone
many readers of 'waiting for godot ' obsess about the identity of godot and whether he represents god or any other almighty being it is unlikely that beckett was referring to god as the man for whom the characters are waiting as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in beckett 's theatre although beckett was not referring directly to god the name is not without importance godot is seen as a messianic being by the characters who will bring salvation for those who believed he would come the wait for god is not represented by the play but is used as a template 'waiting for godot ' is essentially a sustained metaphor for how most if not all human beings spend their whole life waiting for something that is n't coming beckett was not able to identify godot because of the subjective nature of such a being as critics have written this play is a written test and a failure to see any coherent meaning says more about the reader than the play this is yet another example of beckett 's chilling insight into human nature and his readiness to state what others are unwilling to accept
waiting for godot a play about two men who can not communicate and always wait for something that never comes attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with it is a call to action this play is packed with nonsensical dialogue the plot does not exsist yet once we realized that waiting for godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense at least in subtle ways much of the play can not be interpreted in any finality but that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century it 's enigmatic a puzzle of words poetry and philosophy i recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge the play is short and does not take too much commitment take a quiet evening and give it a shot what are you waiting for
this book is just what it advertises it is good and practical advice for those just starting out on their teaching careers i 've been teaching for several years but i found a good number of ideas in here to help orient our new faculty i have just pulled every book in the library i could find on preparing faculty to instruct and this one was the best of the entire pile i think it should be read by everyone just starting their teaching career
i received this book as a gift and at first i thought names would be too many to look through but the lists really helped me narrow things down plus my husband and i had a lot of fun flipping to random pages and seeing what we 'd find !
if nothing else this book is great fun all the names from different cultures and countries are fascinating though i 'm not sure i 'd want to name a daughter osiris '' especially since every name has a short description of its origin and meaning next to it lansky has clearly done his research there are lists of the most popular names from 1900 to 2004 and the big trends in in the past few years so you can decide whether you want to go with or against the trends lansky has a few quick easy articles about picking a name you and your baby will love it seems like so many people today forget to pick a name that will actually suit their child a name that the child will want for the rest of their life and the impressions names make on people as well as the legal aspect of naming did you know that in the united states it is against the law to use numbers in names it 's a huge book a great resource i do n't plan to have kids of my own for a few years yet and i do n't think i 'll use a baby name book of any kind when i do but i have a few friends who 've purchased this book and really loved it and i enjoy reading it too
i suspect the previous review from mom of one '' must be unnaturally biased or somehow associated with a competitor 's title because it appears that she only exists sporadically enough to tout her chosen title and then belittle its competitors nothing else currently seems to exist for this entity worst of all she '' disclaims this book as being a copy of a title published in 2005 first edition 2003 when a quick shows that this publisher meadowbrook lansky has been making baby name books since the late and is clearly one of the leaders in the field this book is great as a resource names neatly alphabetized with their origin and meaning in an astounding range of ethnicities and languages names ! i think that 's more names than any other title on the market of this subject and i love that it has french greek japanese hawaiian ! ! ! african latvian spanish chinese you name it ! so you 're not limited in any way even names and their offshoots names evolved from other names are included a pretty great resource for parents and writers alike i 'm still a year or two off from family planning with the significant other but i 've browsed through this for the future and of course everyone looks up their own name i 've used this title as part of a gift basket to two of my planning expectant friends and they 've both loved it and used it extensively one of the gifted copies seems to be a permanent fixture on a coffee table and considerably great gift on its own to ' parents or put it in a basket with some bottles a couple of bibs baby and plush toy and you 've got a pretty terrific baby shower gift
the recipes were fun to make and very southern book is worth having in your kitchen including for yankees
after watching paula deen on the food network and then visiting her restaurant the lady and sons in savannah i knew this cookbook collection was a must for our home her recipes are simple and delicious there is something in there for everyone with new creations that delight the palette her chicken recipes such as chicken georgia chicken and dumplings and chicken casserole are easy and delicious the corn casserole was probably the easiest dish i have ever prepared and was gone immediately it is a great sign in my home if you do not have leftovers i do not have leftovers when i cook with paula deen the only downside is we are having to exercise more because of this delicious food i figure that it is a small price to pay for having enjoyable sit down dinners with the family i would definitely endorse this collection for any home this would be a great gift this christmas season
forget what e brown says what was this person thinking i will tell you that these are recipes that for the most part include ingredients that any southern cook will find on hand at any time simple easy and very tasty recipes that your family will love if some appear to have a high fat content and that bothers you then use your brain and take measures accordingly it really is that easy
to the lady who gave paula 's book a 1 star because it 's all fattening salty foods puhleeze ! she said she watches the show do you really paula is a southern cook and southern cooking is full of rich food she always says her favorite food is butter ! her cookbooks are fantastic every time i make something to bring to the office or to a potluck i use one of her recipes and they always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe she 's the tops
tried true favorites along with some new ones it does n't get any more tasty or simple than the recipes in this collection the two books together are a great deal cover just about anything you 'd ever want to whip up in the kitchen even if cooking is not your thing paula 's recipes are so yummy they might help change your mind

this is the best cat care book i have ever read it really helped me with the deliver of my cats kittens and then the after care of them it also halped me train my cat not to do cetain things like scratching the carpet and couch should get this if you have acat it really helps alot
i read this years ago when it first was published and recommended it to friends and family we all agreed that despite the unusual format it was wonderful and we found ourselves quoting it to each other for months steve kluger is an incredible write
i 've read this book countless times now it is a doubt my favorite read i own 2 hardcopies and i 've just ordered more paperbacks to give out as gifts at 4.99 it is a steal
let me state for the record i 'm not a fan of baseball unless of course it 's my husband or boys out on the field and even then i keep my mouth shut because i really do n't know what i 'm watching that said i was n't sure how i 'd do with this book but i found myself heavily engrossed in it right from the first word and loved every bit of it kluger 's humor and imagination kept me turning pages late into the night heck i did n't even do that with the chick lit books i usually devour ! i adored the way he told the story through dialogue and letters a pleasant twist that i really enjoyed it took a great deal of courage in my opinion to bring the plot to its climax the way kluger did it could have gone in a number of other ways and brought back around to the conclusion just as easily without taking it to that extreme nope not going to give it away but the fact that he did do it and was able to keep me reading to the very end despite making that move deserves a standing ovation job well done ! whether you 're a big fan of the game a baseball widow during the season man or woman this is a delightful poignant story to add to your summer reading list or any other season 's list i highly recommend this book
if you read for pleasure then this book is for you a page turner in which you may ignore your favorite television show just so you may read the hysterical and brazen letters between the boy and his chosen recipient the white house a major league baseball player etc the book illustrates the development of relationship between the boy and the baseball player charlie banks the gentile baseball player demonstrates true love for the boy by assisting him to prepare for his bar mitzvah while reading this book one could envision a movie depicting this wonderful story
last days of summer '' is a thoroughly moving novel it reminds me of the movies the sandlot '' and my summer story '' and of the play brighton beach memoirs '' i 'm not a fan of baseball but that did n't stop me from loving this story it 's told through a series of letters notes flyers posters and newspaper clippings over the span of two years during world war ii and it was a smart way of telling the story the humor is sarcastic and delightful and you 'll become engrossed in the relationships and friendships made because of this you wo n't be able to stop crying or at least get i recommend
so many books with boys as the central character have plots that center around athletics or some sort of heroic action this one manages to keep those themes baseball a major war and still make the story about a friendship this book is very funny but more importantly it is a special window into how people can make a difference in each other 's lives and a bonus is that the letters to each other '' format who remembers what epistolary means anymore makes it an easy read
i have been looking for this book for a while after my boss suggested we read this i enjoyed it and i wanted to share it but i could n't remember the name just the style and subject needless to say i am getting it now and sharing it often
i read this book twice in the same week i read constantly anything and everything but i 've never done that before i laughed so hard several times that tears were running down my face ! i have recommended it to every person that i talk to that is a reader '' when working in a bookstore years ago the publisher sent the book to us to read before it went on sale i have no idea how many i actually hand sold but it was a lot
this is a great book i recommened for anyone in the grade or in high school i read this book because the cover and tittle sounded good but i read the first letter to charlie banks and i was hooked if you dont read the entire book you will miss it so do n't just try spark notes read the book
i enjoyed the characters in this book i loved the feelings you got from sarah and felt her feelings of just sticking with something because you do n't want to rock the boat in case there is n't anything better for you ! moving on can be a scary spot to be in
i just finished this book and thought i could see where someone would say it was boring '' but i just loved the story loved the history of sarah tracking down her loved the details of the house and was very jealous of such a nice house ! and all in all this was one of the better of danielle steel 's recent works yes there was some repetition but not as bad as impossible '' i would say if you 've been hesitating to pick up a danielle steel book lately as i have this one might actually be enjoyable ! ! is she on her way back i know we all hope so as we know she is capable of great work that 's why we stay her fans
teaches us how to understand the death of a family member or loved one and how to cherish the final moments with them
this book is one of the first great books that has gifted us with her insight and compassion are unremarkable i am sad she wo n't be writing any more books though her latest book on grief and grieving '' is a wonderful book also there are some case studies to go by and it truly touches your soul
elisabeth once again inspires us to learn how to care for those dying patients and their family members this book assists our care and compassion through true life experiences of those dying this book grabs at your heart and pulls you in !
each time people around me lost their family i gave this book most of them said that it was a great help to recover from grief i myself experienced a hard time to accept mentally a familly member 's death and the book gave me a relief though i do not believe everything written in it
though written back in the 60 's this was a very interesting thought provoking read on treatment of and interaction with people who are terminally it gives valuable insight into why people act or do not act in certain ways and as to how they want to be treated when they are dying children as well as adults it also covers family interactions which are so critical to the patient 's emotional physical state of being
a book by one of the most eminent writers on the psychology of death and dying this volume goes through what the dying have to say to doctors nurses clergy and their own families other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles the course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy thus there is a strong christian element first this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity but i soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith which put things in perspective munch of the information provided is enlightening and eminently current much of the rest is dated after all this book was written in the late i was particularly interested in the reactions of staff and other professionals to course and its results i would hope that with the evolution of medical teaching there would not be a little less resitance but i can not judge that the second revelation were the family relationships and patterns revealed by the patient interviews i 'm currently studying family therapy families and how to survive them '' and this was highly relevant
i have n't had a chance to read the book in its entirity but have enjoyed what i have read
for most of us the area of thanatology is something quite new despite the fact that death is such an intimate companion '' that can come at any moment of our lives whether by degrees or instantaneously irrelevant of our ethnic social and economic backgrounds it is a plain truth that can not be avoided and no technological advancements can make it go away i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you despite what your feelings may be and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier the adult must equally do so with death not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means the total cessation of physical life for if one denys its existence and its inevitability the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental spiritual and religious grief as well submission to and acceptance of the truth no matter how difficult it would be to hear could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing in elizabeth 's classic study of the dying process she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all hence how do you take the sting from the wound in on death and dying you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say to let them vent and at their own pace go through the classic defined stages of the dying process denial and isolation anger bargaining depression and acceptance the patients become our teachers we learn of their fears their possible financial burdens in one woman 's case the fear of the worms et cetera but we also learn about what the families go through their own anger and disbelief and guilt it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger other times not the united states is one of the most countries out there a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process for going foward means only one thing death ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe death has issues for everybody doctors people even ross heself it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together
this book is very helpful to understand the overall grieving process from counselor to doctor to family and ultimately to a terminally ill patient this book can be very helpful recommended highly
bereavement counseling the grieving throughout the life cycle is a compact little book that covers the basics of grief counseling author david crenshaw presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss these tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by elisabeth crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages preschool children children adolescents young adults adults in midlife and the elderly using abbreviated case histories as examples the book provides an overview of the grieving process and some basic suggestions for interventions with people in the various age groups it does not however give the amount of information and detail that would be required to help a counselor develop proficiency in counseling the bereaved in attempting to cover such a wide array of populations in a small book crenshaw sacrifices specificity the longest chapter is devoted to the preschool aged child with the main thrust of his recommendations being monologues that the counselor delivers to the child he only minimally mentions play therapy arguably the most effective type of therapy for children in this age group this reviewer finds the omission of play therapy techniques for the bereaved child to be the most serious lack in this book bereavement is an interesting and highly readable book that gives some good basic information the counselor interested in developing effective grief resolution therapy skills would do well to use this book as a starting point from which to begin building her skills and then follow it with more publications devoted to the specific population she is counseling reviewed by kathleen higgins lpc mental health counselor
my husband and i are lawyers who have recently returned to reading shakesepare decades after college we wanted literary criticism that was qualitative superior to the plot summary readers guide criticism that would help us explore the imagery themes and metaphors of the plays marjorie garber is the answer to our prayers we recommend to readers returning to shakespeare that they purchase a paperback edition of each play with good notes to help with line specific language issues the arden series is the then the experience with garbers insights it is a pleasure for us to carefully read each play and then see what treasures she has mined based on her own reading and that of prior critics we considerably prefer garber to bloom as a single compendium garber packs an enormous amount of insight into a single 30 page chapter shakespeare is surely worth the detail she provides i would also suggest that you purchase the ambrose dvd set of tapes of the great bbc plays after you have read the plays it is wonderful to watch jacobi et al the dvd format enables captions which is very helful to savoring every line
william shakespeare 's immortal words will live forever in this excellent book of criticism professor garber of harvard examines each of the 38 plays from the two gentlemen of verona '' through the two noble kinsman '' her work is detailed and insightful for anyone who seeks more knowledge and understanding of shakepeare and his plays as we explore shakespeare we also learn more about what it is to be human being in the world ! garber writes about each play as she analyzes the characters and their motivation the history of the play 's production and how the play is related to other plays and characters in the shakespearean canon along the way we learn the derivation of words used by the bard what was going on in england and the world at the time the play was written and such various topics as sumptuary laws dealing with clothing class structure and the growth of the english language shakespeare 's life is covered in an insightful introduction marjorie garber must be a brilliant person to listen to in the lecture hall ! i wish these insighful looks at each play would be available in tape format ! her book is a classic which should be required reading for anyone teaching shakespeare in high school college and adult education classes i was fascinated by her depth of scholarship and ability to relate shakespeare to our day my highest appreciation to this wonderful book on our great treasure of poetry and the art of drama william shakespeare
this is a monster of a book packed full of insight into the plays of william shakespeare another reviewer has criticized the way professor gerber tackles each play but i think she pitches her analyses pretty spot on as she describes a play she will stop and detour into some aspect of the cultural mores of the england of shakespeare 's day and come back i find as a layman that is exactly what i wanted i was n't looking for heavy textual criticism that might only be understandable to other eng lit professors this is an excellent book for the layman if you are prepared to concentrate and forgive professor gerber when she does occasionally throw in a semantics term that you have never heard of usually she explains them but not always
this is a wonderful rich exploratory book that holds nothing back a meditation about the shakespeare canon that resonates in all planes at once it is certain to be by college teachers everywhere and so it should be together with shapiro 's 1599 as a biography and a solid encyclopaedia like the oxford companion to shakespeare this is one of the only supplementary volumes you 'd ever want to shelf next to the complete works this is the kind of critical homage and investigation shakespeare has been waiting for all these years i hope he and marjorie garber meet in heaven and that someone leaks the resulting sonnets
marjorie garber 's shakespeare after all '' is scholarship on shakespeare 's plays it is a 'must have ' for anyone interested in shakespeare 's works whether the person has a casual interest or a scholarly background the information is conveyed in an accessible style i have purchased a number of copies and given this work as gifts to friends one should pick it up and read it before seeing any performance of the plays kudos garber ! exceptional work mj moore detroit
as a fan of shakespeare both on the and written page i have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright first there was asimov 's guide to shakespeare which was a commentary on the historical contexts of the plays then there was harold bloom 's shakespeare the invention of the human a scholarly work offset by a tone of intellectual snobbery and condescension now there is shakespeare after all a work that fits between these two in quality in shakespeare after all marjorie garber 's page tome on the bard 's plays we are given an opportunity to learn more of what makes shakespeare shakespeare as a harvard and yale lecturer on shakespeare garber certainly has the credentials and experience to back up her extensive essays on the plays if there is a problem with the book it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them the book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work then we get a chapter on each of plays including the two noble kinsmen which is not always included in shakespeare collections the plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language garber is a good writer and each chapter is insightful as this is written more as a collection of essays there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy which i suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order as stated before however the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays in garber 's view shakespeare batted 1.000 all hits and no misses henry viii seems to be just as worthy of merit as othello or hamlet furthermore there are no mistakes any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended not just an error certainly shakespeare is worth a lot of praise when you consider what he did writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent he is definitely deserving of the title genius '' but he was n't perfect it would be nice if garber acknowledged this but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses and if you are interested in learning more about shakespeare 's plays this is a worthwhile way to get that education
i bought this book on the strength of marjorie garber 's excellent past renaissance scholarship i was expecting something more theoretically informed and original but as it is this is a very worthwhile book and i predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students it 's a big book with a substantial chapter on each play but not the sonnets as with harold bloom 's book on shakespeare garber however is less idiosyncratic than bloom she synthesizes the best of recent scholarship but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la derrida and lacan garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context for example in her chapter on macbeth she relates a new critical '' analysis of the clothing imagery to sumptuary laws regarding clothing laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of renaissance england the strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts and her brilliant analysis of shakespeare 's language close reading while her work is illuminated by recent scholarship she avoids the stalinesque imperatives of political correctness compare garber 's intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in macbeth with stephen orgel 's introduction '' in the complete pelican shakespeare in which he reductively reads the play as a misogynist fantasy '' the only reason i docked the book one star is that based on the chapters i 've read so far she does n't really make a major original contribution to shakespeare studies in contrast to for example greenblatt 's recent bio of shakespeare will in the world so much as synthesize what we already know all in all a very valuable reference book that i will be consulting regularly in my college teaching highly recommended for high school teachers english majors undergraduate and graduate and all fans of shakespeare
clear and present danger is an action packed and informing novel by tom clancy it places you into the united states government fight the war on drugs the government is stepping up its assault on teh druggies after the director of the fbi is killed in bogota a young staff sergeant domingo chavez joins the fight as a scout in an elite group of soldiers fighting the druggies directly this book is excellent both in its exciting storytelling and realistic twist i would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys very technical writing or anyone who enjoys a good action story
i 'd go as far to say this is better than the hunt for red october compared to the dire offerings clancy serves up now such as red rabbit this book is good enough to make you wonder if it was not written by a different author the plotting is very tight and action is nicely placed at 600 odd words this is still a long book but short for clancy the asassination of the american ambassador is as a couple of reviewers pointed out not until about 300 pages in but there is more than enough to keep your attention until then clancy 's strong point was never characterisation and some of his books i feel just sag with the weight of words and extraordinarily long chapters i remember reading other novels of his and skipping paragrapahs here and there this one i did n't put down until i had finished it politically it 's his most sophisticated as well i always feel that sometimes clancy was too comfortable painting a picture of the us as whiter than white here he brings in elements of moral ambiguity as an illegal war is started in columbia there is still enough military hardware and action too keep you going as well and not too much to overload you overall i feel this is his best work his most balanced and clever book if he could produce something half as good as this it would still be better than the tripe he has served up recently
the story of the book goes a high ranking offical is killed in colombia and the socking covet response this is the fifth book in the jack ryan series would recommend to anyone
the book begins like modern headlines and top stories in the news a coast guard boat discovers several dead bodies on a drifting boat out at sea piecing together the scenes the captain and his crew understand the grisly details which became all too clear before the discovery they announce their intention to board the boat only to find two columbians who speak little and look guilty as sin the captain and crew have the presence of mind to record on film permanently what the encountered they nearly gag at what they find contrary to usual procedure they create a justice at sea '' bogus trial based on some ancient mariner 's manual it is just the right scenario to create fear in their prisoners which extracts a confession from them that the coast guard believes will stand up in court and get them prosecuted in washington dc clandestine operations are executed for a secret american plan to use the most talented night warriors the us army has ever produced to fight the drug cartel in columbia on their own turf the select group all have spanish roots and were salvaged from a life on the streets where they would surely work against the system to build a clean life in the army the better alternative this book shows how power politics secret decisions and behind the scenes operations occur which could shake up the core values of a country clandestine activities work outside the boundaries of national and international law if they were made public there would be a huge outcry from usa citizens and of the world judgement it is at this time that jack ryan becomes acting director of the cia the cia director is in the hospital with a terminal illness the current president has not a clue of how the drug war is being fought and won he is only aware of the results drug cartel airplanes are being shot down and the us is winning it is an election year his main concern is gaining a positive standing in the polls and with world opinion he knows very little of reality meanwhile when the second in command of the drug cartel is discovered to have acted on classified information known only to a few the accusations in washington dc fly an insider investigation begins to discover where the leaks occured this book is nonstop action and difficult to put down each chapter reveals another complex episode which adds another layer of deals and shady activity all of which make this a most satisfying reading experience although at times this novel is difficult to follow the subject matter is contemporary and the unfolding events are highly plausible making it one unstoppable page turner the planning and execution of the warrior commandos is superb the covert operations highly ingenious the political subterfuge and communications are labyrinthine shocking in their believability expect only the best from tom clancy you will never be disappointed erika borsos
veteran voice performer charles is not only one of the most accomplished audio book narrators working today he 's also one of the busiest both listeners and publishers seem to know that if charles lends his narrative skills to a production it 's going to be highly listenable an example is his rendering of this by the unparalleled tom clancy once again clancy tears his theme from today 's headlines our country 's fight against drugs as the story opens our commander in chief is n't at all pleased with the progress being made in this battle so a formidable team is dispatched to colombia to put an end to the struggle it does n't work as planned drug lords as is known show no mercy and they retaliate by killing civilians a beleaguered president gives orders to not only end the original plan but to erase it it should look as if it never existed when jack ryan now deputy director of for the cia discovers that this aborted plan has been going on unbeknownst to him and some men have been stranded ryan decides to rescue them in true clancy fashion it 's ryan to the rescue but it 's a heart stopping struggle gail cooke
i 'm a big tom clancy fan and i just loved every minute reading this book very well done very well written could n't have been done better clancy always kept me on the edge and he is able to put in alot of great info and he knows soo much about alot of what he writes in his boo
with some interesting twists and a complicated plot this author grips the reader baseline story involves a good cop a failed one who makes a living after resigning from the police force and struggles with a drinking problem and a retired one who become involved after a murder hauntingly familiar to an unsolved one from many years ago by a serial killer who was never caught in the course of attempting to solve the murder a dirty cop is unearthed the violent ending resolves part of the mystery along the way good insight is offered into the lives of the police and their everyday struggles with the overwhelming crime rate in this author is widely admired for the pace of his novels making them hard to put down crisp dialogue excellent settings and believeable characters as well as sharp observations about today 's world make the book an excellent read
in the field of crime novel writers there are 5 current ones who make it to my a '' list to qualify the writer has to have a unique writing style along with excellent character development and finally a plot to die for the five writers imo who have been most consistent in regards to the above are george pelecanos james lee burke james ellroy andrew vachss and elmore 've read everything these five writers have written and because they 've raised the bar so high it 's difficult to read anyone else however i will admit that both robert crais and dennis lehane are close to being included
i have n't read every crime author 's work but i have read works by a number of those considered to be top echelon writers and for my money pelecanos is the hands down best of the bunch and of his work the night gardener is one of the best novels if this were a sporting event instead of a crime novel espn would make it an instant classic '' it has great characters a great plot outstanding settings and surprises it 's a solid effort by a very gifted author if you like crime novels get on it you wo n't be sorry
in 1985 three teenagers are murdered in washington each of the victims have names that form palindromes otto ava and eve at the scene are cook detective sargeant and two gus ramone and dan doc '' holiday the palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of cook flash forward to 2005. gus ramone is married now and has two children dan holiday left the police force under a cloud cook long retired has been forgotten by nearly all along with the palindrome murders but asa johnson 14 is found dead with a bullet through his brain no gun no witnesses could the palindrome murderer be back after a 20 year absence the hunt for the murderer of asa johnson is the leitmotif for this compelling if sometimes very quirky police procedural gus ramone is the central character no superman ramone is career cop not burned out but not an either ramone of ancestry has a black wife regina and two kids diego 14 and alana 7. gus loves his wife and children dearly his love for them and the problems of bringing a male through the storms of adolescence form the second leg of the story holiday and ramone have a history '' holiday is convinced he was a great cop and would have become a legenday cop if it were n't for the ramone in the internal affairs division holiday discovers the body of the teenage asa johnson and phones the police anonymously holiday then teams up with the real legend cook to prove that the palindrome murderer is back and to capture him this is the third leg of the story the fourth leg is an unsparing tale of the black criminal subculture this is not for the overly sensitive these four themes support some of those most masterful storytelling i 've seen in a long time pelecanos has the workaday world of the police down pat no superheroics just hard work persistence and some specially skilled people like bo greene who is able to talk murderers into confessing ramone has a special interest in the murder of asa johnson not because it is his case which it is not but because asa was a friend of his son ramone 's work on the case leads down some dark paths which also brings pelecanos into some very strange and frankly hypocritical sermonizing saying anything more than that would be a spoiler and i wo n't do that concurrent with ramone 's investigation is the work of holiday and cook ramone and holiday seem to bewalking down the road to a showdown despite the unwelcome and unnecessary excursions into cultural politics the night gardener '' is a terrific police procedural and a social commentary as well well worth reading jerr
i have read everything mr pelecanos has written and generally find his work to be thoughtful and original the night gardener is his best work to date the stories are interesting and well paced but it the characters and the subtlety with which they are drawn and brought together that makes this book special the conclusion is thought provoking and important it is true to the characters and believable all in all a great book mr pelecanos has packed so much into 372 pages in itself this is an impressive feat my previous favorite pelecanos book was shame the devil
when you think of crime fiction you think of cities and the writers who depict them in their books michael connelly robert crais walter angeles carl florida lawrence york city like new york and so on no writer does washington dc like george pelecanos he grew up there he knows those gritty streets this new book is a real departure for the author its the story of 3 cops who are trying to solve an ancient crime one retired one fired the last a veteran a family man years ago somebody was killing children and leaving their bodies near community gardens then it stopped the three cops who were on the original cases went their separate ways then it starts happening again pelecanos crafts a noir thriller well worth the read
well guess what its harry 's second year at hogwarts he 's back with hermione and ron he 's just discovered that he can talk to snakes but does n't know why until after a while they tell him he can speak parsel tongue able to speak to snakes this gets him into trouble because he goes into the girl 's bathroom and starts to speak parsel tongue and it opens a secret door to the chamber of secrets there he faces tom riddle and wins by destroying his journal
still amazed by writing and still in love with the book it 's well worth the read too bad the movie kind of ruined it for me after thsi is one of the more scary harry potter even though i find it more suspensful and eventful read it you 'll like it
great information and easy read i learned more in one book than the other 5 i read on the heart and the things we can do to help heal as a yoga instructor i will recommend this to my ailling students
the view that all types of medicine western and eastern working together makes sense this book seems to encorage a balance between both i enjoyed it
oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation he describes how he combines complementary medicine hypnosis reflexology yoga message acupuncture etc with orthodox western medicine there is an excellent forward by dr dean ornish and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques the bulk of the book contains stories of patients oz treated using this revolutionary way i am a cardiologist and i have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine which is the reason i bought this book however this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment nevertheless those interested in this new medicine which i think will be the medicine of the new millennium will want to read this book
what is impressive about this book is the author 's concepts of healing both heart and mind as he points out just how closely the two are interconnected the writing style is one that will grasp the reader 's attention from start to finish the approach to holistic health is a welcome approach to healing it is a concept that is gradually increasing in the health care field but one that still has a long way to go before it is universally accepted by all physicians more education and information needs to be provided in this area to all health care providers using the holistic approach there can be fewer side effects from medication less depression and a general feeling of well being during the most trying and difficult times there is much to be said on combining western and eastern traditions in the process of healing our world can benefit dramatically from this approach and the author vividly explains why throughout the pages of this and superbly written book it is highly recommended reading material and most deserving of a five star rating
though need to get out the dictionary sometimes mythopoetic gestures profundity epitome this is really excellent looking forward to rereading the 20 cent copy of all the preety horses i just ordered with my girlfriend and this book 's insights into this great writer my favorite
i like typing i like seeing my words in print on the internet i have a lot of time to waste but all in all it is a good book that is in ok shape for its age and was at a good price
this book if full of helpful information and is organized in a way that makes it easy to use for reference purposes give it a once through and then shelve it for reference purposes this one is worth having in your management collection
any manager with hiring authority knows that selecting the right '' candidate for any position is a task professional processes can help you screen interview and review but the final choice is often as much art as science author martin yate 's basic book can help inexperienced managers hire effectively although this useful primer on interviewing and hiring is a little wordy yates provides great detail about key steps such as when to schedule a phone interview what to ask and how to conduct an interview he even provides numerous sample questions for each major job category from entry level to management is it a little too basic perhaps for some but we recommend it for new managers who are inexperienced at hiring although this book covers the fundamentals of hiring it ca n't guarantee that you 'll make the right choice every time then again that book probably has n't been written
like many small business people i was a complete bozo at hiring for many years fortunately at some point i woke up to that fact and decided to educate myself i took classes read books and did everything i could to become a skilled interviewer without question one of the most helpful tools to escaping bozoland was this book although i am now a freelance business consultant and have no employees of my own i frequently assist my clients with their own hiring processes and in so doing i still refer extensively to martin yate 's excellent book
this is an extremely well written and very useful book on hiring techniques and methods the author analyzes all aspects of the hiring process beginning with the different types of resumes and when each type is used what flags to look for and how to evaluate an applicant 's overall resume chapter five focuses on through a ' while the subsequent chapters are devoted to interviewing techniques and the science of asking questions the author introduces four different interviewing techniques situational personality profile stress and behavioral and also gives a very useful and informative analysis of the different types of questions that can be asked in a hiring interview like reflexives questions and question layering in the following chapters the author focuses on evaluating the candidate 's ability and willingness to do the job as well as manageability the questions and the author 's commentary on what to look for and red flags in an applicant 's answer are informative highly usable and extremely useful these are not your 'standard ' interview questions though there are some pretty standard questions included they are well formulated and clever probes into the applicant 's skills knowledge personality and background the rest of the book is devoted to functional areas with a chapter devoted to clerical management sales contingency workers and law hires again i found the advice and suggestions relevant and informative in formulating the hundreds of question suggestions scattered throughout the book the author has given a lot of thought to the qualities experiences and areas of concern that hiring managers and hr people focus on
i use this book both for interviewing techniques and for preparing to be interviewed its a great book for interviewing because he presents the pros and cons of different techniques and gives what i consider to be a good framework for identifying quality candidates its a great book for preparing to be interviewed because it helps you identify the objectives of interviewers and make a better case as a hiring manager you should be able to pass an interview with flying colors should n't you perhaps the most enlightening wisdom i got from the book was the enumeration of the qualities of a good employee 1. ability to do the job 2. willingness to do the job 3. manageability of the candidate most interviews focus on the abilities of the candidates and stop there big mistake ! yate gives you guidance on evaluating the whole candidate and in general i like and agree with his advice other good ideas are evaluating the cracks in resumes phone screening and lunch never hire anyone without checking background verifying employment and education and seeing if they can carry on a conversation at lunch i draw ideas for interviews from several books but this one is the overall framework that i have worked from i feel the style is readable the length is appropriate and the content is excellent
if you are looking for a solid foundation of your interview process take a look at this book it provides helpful ideas on how to approach your job candidates can they do the job are they willing and can they be managed it provided lots of helpful questions and processes for a successful hiring process i have to say that i am not a professional recruiter just someone that needs to hire and evaluate his new employees
this book has that unique ability to make you feel as though you are learning something while at the same time make you feel like you knew nothing until you opened the book schaeffer is a good writer and has good observations
the idea of the project how should we then live both as a film documentary and as a book was conceived in 1974 and completed in 1976. in the acknowledgments francis schaeffer writes about the idea behind the project using my study over the past forty years of western thought and culture as a base we could attempt to present the flow and development which have led to thinking and by so doing hope to show the essential answers '' the subtitle to how should we then live is the rise and decline of western thought and culture '' starting from ancient roman times tracing man 's development throughout the middle ages going to the renaissance reformation and enlightenment he shows the steps which led to the modern era chapter summaries chapter rome the finite gods were not a sufficient inward base for the roman society rome crumbled from within and the invasions of the barbarians only completed the breakdown chapter middle ages the middle ages were the age a time of uncertainty in which there were great advances of the church but also great distortions of biblical truth eventually leading to the renaissance and the reformation chapter renaissance although the renaissance revived the realization that man and nature are important it went overboard by making man the measure of all by that destroyed the importance of man chapter reformation like the renaissance the reformation sought to bring freedom to man yet unlike the renaissance it did not lose sight of the bible and absolute values chapter the impact of the reformation on society at large was the opportunity of freedom without chaos chapter enlightenment the enlightenment believed in the perfectibility of society and sought to bring it about mainly by the means of revolution chapter rise of modern science modern science could only have arisen from a christian foundation namely that man is not part of a closed system but can observe and act into the system chapter breakdown of philosophy and science the foundation in philosophy and science was changed from antithetical thinking to dialectic because of it reason became more and more pessimistic chapter philosophy and modern theology due to the pessimistic view on reason philosophy and theology started to seek meaning in the irrational chapter art music literature and films what began in philosophy now made itself felt in the arts the abandonment of reason and increased fragmentation chapter society we have come full circle since our society has become like the declining roman empire of old it is marked by the love of affluence a widening gap between rich and poor an obsession with sex freakishness in the arts and an increased desire to live off the state chapter and the new elite because our society stands on the verge of chaos we are in danger of coming under an authoritarian elite which will increasingly manipulate our lives chapter alternatives the only plausible alternative to authoritarianism is to align ourselves to a biblical worldview which produces freedom without chaos conclusion whether or not one agrees with all of schaeffer 's points his passion to be a christian who engages secular culture has laid the foundation stone for much of christian thinking in the past three decades
while my own convictions are not reflected in schaeffer 's books he always presents a thoughtful challenge to those who would disagree with his positions this book is no exception for a broader view of the nature of morality see my morality does 'god ' make a difference '' where i show why and how belief in god makes a difference for good or ill
in this book schaeffer illustrates that the reason the world is in such disarray is because we no longer have a moral and ethical foundation to build upon this book explores the paramount philosophic religious and scientific ideas from the decline of rome until the he claims that in order to understand where we are today we must trace these three lines in history he begins with the decline of rome with its amalgamation of greek values and proceed through the middle ages the renaissance the reformation the enlightenment romanticism industrialism modernity and the world not only does schaeffer explore the history of western philosophy religion and science but also history art culture cinema christianity humanism and communism furthermore there is a flow to history that is rooted in people 's thoughts their determines how they act the results of this or world view impact the external world schaeffer points out that individual people throughout the establishment of western culture impacted the external world with their lives these impacts led to the present culture that we live in now many of these individuals shaped our culture to reject a biblical foundation with absolute morals and ethics to live by instead of this moral foundation the west is now functioning on top of a feeble relative foundation schaeffer asserts that this is the reason our culture is in its current hysteria he basically divides man and his view on the world into the two categories of belief in an infinite god christianity and belief in the absence of an infinite deity humanism the book provides evidence proving that the christian belief promotes a solid basis for morals ethics and order however humanism promotes relativism and chaos it is on this basis that schaeffer proves that without christian principles a culture is doomed to failure he points out that christianity gives meaning and beauty to all individual and corporate life anything short of it brings death to every aspect of life because of this schaeffer is not hesitant to point out that the cure for society rests in christianity alone this book was written so that we would turn from the greatest of wickedness the placing of any created thing in the place of the creator and that this generation may get its feet out of the paths of death and may live '' the style francis schaeffer adopted is straightforward and logical he openly admitted that his book does not make a pretense of a complete history of western culture but enough historical evidence is used to prove his point effectively schaeffer developes his arguments based on the basis that ideas or worldviews act on the cause and effect theory he also compares and contrasts the worldview with secular views to further develop his argument overall the argument presented is proved in a coherent way although flow of the book is smooth and easy it also includes a logical message that is vital to the western world how should we then live is a book directed at the west as the people of the western culture we would do well to listen to the message this book portrays as schaeffer effectively points out if we do not take heed and return to a biblical moral foundation the world as we know it will continue to spiral down a path to destruction i highly recommend this book and if the intended audience would take caution and listen to that it is declaring then it would save us from turmoil and destruction this book points out the problem and the remedy it would be foolish for a person who has cancer to turn down a remedy that would heal him it would also be irrational for is to ignore the cure for our disorderly culture
not many people know that there was a 10 episode film series with the same title and that there is a paper back study guide that compliments this book i first read this book 22 years ago when i was trying to figure out why the world was going to hell in a handbasket it answered a lot of my questions and made me ask more questions i rate this as one of the 10 most important books i 've read in my lifetime and i 'm getting to be an old lady now i 'm getting ready to read it again because i feel it has a new relevance for our time in light of the persecution of christianity in the public arena i also bring to your attention his book a christian manifesto if you seek true wisdom born of knowledge this is your book
francis schaeffer covers a lot of territory both geographically and in terms of subject matter in this book chronologically he starts with ancient rome and goes to the the time the book was published illustrations are included to assist in making his case schaeffer contends there is a flow or pattern to history and in this book he sets out to explain the flow of western culture on page 52 he discusses the role philosophy had in separating the influence of divine revelation as found in the bible from epistemology he uses raphaels ' painting of the school of athens '' 1510 to illustrate the separation symbolically the painting depicts two viewpoints one looking upward toward god the other viewing lower sources such as man in europe this gravitation toward one or the other direction took the forms of the reformation god and the renaissance man he discusses the philosophies of the prime movers in each of the two schools of thought on page 108 he notes many good things in england came from scotland '' one of them being the concept of lex rex law is king '' the concept was that no one was above the law that it was the same for everyone regardless of rank or position he traces the idea for the american revolution back to these seeds planted in the minds of those of english ancestary the reader is carried up to the this is a book that helps a person see consequences over the long haul it reminds one of the observation of russell kirk ideas have quot
far from reducing the islamic republic of iran to some kind of timeless expression of islamic culture tradition or identity the author demonstrates the competing ideological influences that shaped the islamic republic not least of which were western notions of political particpation the author does a good job of showing how these tensions are reflected in the reform movement and in the struggle for power currently unfolding in iran thus i found the book very useful i would only add that the author may have given insufficient attention to the power of the conservative clerics

i find it suprising how so many people can not like this book i read it immediatley after reading book 1 and still thoroughly enjoyed it i love the details the author gives it makes you feel like you are right there and understand and see things as well as the characters do i ca n't wait for book 3 and hope everyone at least gives this book a chance and enjoys it as much as i did despite the
i do n't know why some people are criticizing this book as badly as they are like all fantasy books and stories if you strip them down far enough you get the same basic story characters are whats important in these books and while eragon has much in common with luke skywalker they are different people with different personalities and experiences to give this anything less than 3 stars is pure hateration lay off the haterade this book continues the trilogy very well the training was a little dull and the romance subplot leaves a lot to be desired but this is a good especially for his age novel i look forwarded to reading the and final installment
eragon '' was a great book and much like a previous reviewer said i read it rather quickly it was action packed and suspensful eldest does a good of furthering the trilogy and has a lot of action paolini leaves many questions unanswered so you can expect an amazing final book in the series however despite the action eragon 's training is incredibly boring dull tiresome any other adjective that is synonymous to zzzzzzz '' the worse part is that his training is half the book ! there are a few good training sessions but these are actually outside the training if you have n't read the book you might not understand what i am getting out overall it was still a good novel and i really do n't know why someone would even consider giving it anything lower than 3 stars
eragons journey continues in this book from christopher paolini although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well i have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary they have been enraptured by the story we ca n't wait for book number three
the story continues with eragon being trained by the elfs his brother rowan becoming involved leading up to a great battle with a surprising twist delightful read you learn a lot more about the humans elfs dwarfs dragons and urgals ca n't wait to see how it all ends
yukio mishima is sadly known best for the circumstances of his death he committed seppuku ritual suicide by sword after finishing the final book of this tetralogy the sea of fertility he along with kawabata and murakami is one of the most prominent japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life mishima was called a radical a some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they 're reading him to begin with spring snow is the story of kiyoaki matsugae and his imperially sanctioned and revered family i thought that it was clear early on that kiyoaki was an interesting character he is the image of adolescence in this novel honda kiyo 's best companion i do n't go out of my way to call him a friend is i think more respectable i 'm not sure if mishima in writing this novel was masochistic with kiyoaki and more with some of the other characters but it certainly gives us a great perspective in what goes on in kiyoaki 's mind kiyo and satoko were childhood friends after his interest in her wanes he 's given notice that she is to marry a prince the grass always looks greener on the other side '' this is what i think of looking back on kiyo and his decision to tell his father that there was absolutely nothing '' between himself and satoko he goes on to become more infatuated with her presence doomed as it was inevitable '' is what the synopsis says of this romance the reason i give this 4 stars i really felt the book could 've been 50 to 75 pages shorter i could n't help but get tired of it in places another reviewer mentioed that mishima is n't very inventive but is very skilled i agree with that totally the story itself is not enough to warrant a reading seriously i 've read countless other japanese novels with the exact same plot it 's the way that mishima tells us of his characters and the settings i might go as far to say that yes i think that he is one of the greatest writers of the century all complaints aside this novel is amazing and i feel that i 'd appreciate it even more if i paged through it again mishima writes with a beauty that is hard to categorize it 's not really comparable to murakami or tanizaki or any other famed japanese authors who are still hailed today mishima carried with him demons and angels ! and their chorus is in these pages
this is the first of a group of four novels by mishima called the sea of fertility taken as a group they are excellent novels or even what one might call a literary masterpiece the four books are spring snow '' runaway horses '' the temple of dawn '' and the decay of the angel '' i asked another reader if mishima 's book spring snow '' was a universal story or a period piece unique to japan they were a bit uncertain the good news is that it is both it is a modern century version of romeo and juliet or a similar type of theme but not identical to shakespeare 's drama by any stretch but having said that there are many parallels it is set in tokyo around 1912 it involves two families and two lovers there is a problem betrothal involving the female protagonist satoko kiyoaki is the male and there are outside forces at work the royal family to say more would be to give away the plot i am not an expert on japanese literature but i thought that it rated 5 stars it is a clear and compelling read and i sat down glued to the book and read 270 pages the first day for that reason along with the beauty of the story and the scenery and the characters it deserves 5 stars as i reached the end of the book i thought that the story faltered slightly also the author is great but perhaps not brilliant nor very innovative he is touted as being like dostoevsky '' on the book jacket a quote from the christian science monitor yes there are some fabulous scenes and excellent writing that transports the reader to japan and a rickshaw ride through a snowy spring afternoon but before reading the book i had just finished reading the masterpiece crime and punishment by dostoevsky and some short stories by chekhov in comparison mishima 's love story seemed a bit light compared to dostoevsky but perhaps on par with chekhov that is not a bad comparison in reading the prose i had the same feeling reading this book as i did when i read some of saul bellow 's books especially herzog mishima seems to put a lot of emotional energy into the writing and he says things that are a bit on the edge of social norms in a society such as japan the book must have been a bit racy when it came out is it a world class masterpiece probably not on its own but it is exceptional taken as a group of four the sea of fertility group might be a masterpiece series this is an excellent book and i highly recommend the read as a final note this book has no introduction or extra notes on the author or the book it is just the basic book but it seems to be an excellent translation
this tetralogy is the best source i 've come across about the school of buddhism in a passionate and beautiful story you come to really understand what budhist doctrines about reincarnation mean top rating
spring snow '' is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right it is an eloquent moving story with a tale as old as time '' that of lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations in another culture with another writer this would be a romantic if not happy story but this is japan and the writer is mishima yukio in his hands the lovers kiyoaki and satoko transcend literary stereotypes and become agents of their own happiness and destruction by the very nature of their relationship raised together since childhood playing a complicated game of love and sexual tension their future is never in doubt it is impressive that a writer such as mishima known for his politics and his samurai dreams could craft such a tender love story while knowing the eventual conclusion the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between kiyoaki and satoko and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared not that it is a clear path even knowing japanese literature and the road it usually takes there are surprises on the way things do not turn out the way one would expect i was incredibly moved by spring snow '' it is a novel that affects the heart of the reader and lingers long after the last page is turned
this is not an intent to summarize mishima 's sea of fertility rather it 's an approach into analyzing it a sort of reading between the lines then again what are we exactly trying to portray we would say we are intending to deliver a semiotic vision of what the sea of fertility represents we are not trying to read it for our reader rather we let him read and help him amidst it by presenting a cluster of signs keys semiotics call it whatever you want that would at the end clarify the road and that can be grasped by the reader so he can get a wider vision and a better comprehension of this gigantic universe which mishima called sea of fertility but first why is this bizarre title sea of fertility mishima himself is going to answer this question to give it the first leading sign that we should know it does n't crack secrets for us but merely provides us with a minimum limit which we can begin our journey from in a note mishima sent to the famous american criticizer donald keene he clearly admits that the reason for choosing this title for his tetralogy is a hint for an area of the same designation on the moon 's surface not so far of the sea of silence the reason for this reference is to aim at a contradiction between this vivid and colorful name and the wasteland it stands for in real we can go further on saying that this title combines the image of universal nihilism with the image of sea of fertility in summer 1945 mishima wanted to write an immense oeuvre that would sum up miller 's famous trilogy the rosy crucifixion and that would stress more and more on that dark side of art to write a novel that would take six years of his life and that would cover chronogically those sixty years from 1912 and on that decision which was the most important one in mishima 's practical life obliged writing this novel in four volumes in each an individual story for each a special protagonist but these characters would not be totally separated from each other how the figure in the first volume is the lad kiwaki the noble descent of the wealthy family of matsugai lives a love story one of its kind that memory would not forget easily and his friend honda stands as an eye witness for this superb experience of his from that point on in every volume that succeeds we can notice that the hero is merely the first one but after being reincarnated to start a new cycle of life and to let honda only figure out the connections that ties these four characters mishima knew very well that his tetralogy is a rich threshold for everything he learned as a writer he told his friends that when he finishes it there is only one thing left for him to do suicide and by taking his own life in november 1970 he fulfilled his final quote the life of men is short i want to live forever the sea of fertility is not an easy read nor its a happy one it is a lament melancholic presentation of life rendered by an artist
for a japanese nationalist yukio mishima seems to have had an appreciation for european literature as demonstrated in his wonderful novel spring snow '' the first part of a tetralogy taking place in tokyo in the years following the war and just before the first world war it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed epic with an almost tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a stendhalian romance appropriately one of its themes is the gradual influx of western influence on japanese culture which mishima himself loyal to the samurai tradition might well have resisted most of the novel 's characters are members of the aristocratic society of imperial japan one of these is kiyoaki the son of the marquis matsugae a noble of the royal court kiyoaki is a handsome boy who attracts many girls but is too sullen and withdrawn to make many friends at school as it is his only companion is a bright classmate named shigekuni honda who works hard to please his strict parents by studying law kiyoaki has a tutor named iinuma who secretly disrespects his pupil because he feels that kiyoaki representing the moral decadence of the new era dishonors his ancestors and the dignity of old japan there are also two siamese princes who through diplomatic channels are acquainted with the matsugaes and attend kiyoaki 's school they make a comical duo at least until the tragedy that calls them home to siam the story pertains mainly to the troubled love affair between kiyoaki and satoko the daughter of count ayakura whose family is close to the matsugaes and lives on a nearby estate kiyoaki and satoko were playmates in childhood so it is no surprise that adolescence has brought mutual romantic feelings however her assertive and unsubmissive attitude offends his pride he can not envision her as his wife after he spurns her she accepts a marriage proposal from prince harunori toin a military officer the engagement is formalized by receiving official authorization from the imperial household ministry satoko aware that prince harunori is a dispassionate drone consents to continue seeing kiyoaki their trysts aided and abetted by honda and her maidservant tadeshina until one day when she wakes up with morning sickness imagine the imminent scandal a young lady soon to be a princess in a marriage sanctioned by the empire pregnant by another man before her wedding ! how could she be so irresponsible and how could kiyoaki have such contempt for imperial honor this volatile situation involving the reputations of both the matsugae and the ayakura families advances the story to a nearly shakespearean plateau particularly when satoko heeding hamlet 's advice to ophelia gets herself to a buddhist nunnery kiyoaki 's desperate effort to visit her in the convent during the unseasonable weather indicated in the title ends the novel with a delicate poignancy spring snow '' is a masterly composition that portrays a picturesque japan in transition from the grand ceremoniousness of the imperial aristocracy to the new europeanized etiquette the wealthy japanese are teaching english in their schools driving british cars wearing british clothes listening to german music on german gramophones even celebrating christmas without ostensibly observing christianity mishima perhaps identifying himself with the discontented iinuma may have seen this as cultural degeneration but his chronicle implies nothing disastrous about the beginning of the century in which his country bolstered by the prosperity of its elite was to become a world power
mishima 's spring snow is a rare jewel of a work ! the passion tragedy and intensity of this novel left me wanting to pursue the entire 'sea of fertility ' series i will shortly be reading 'runaway horses ' which follows it but have been forewarned not to expect anything quite on the scale of 'spring snow ' luckily this does n't concern me mishima 's writing style is visual entrancing and magnetic he takes hold of your imagination curiosity and emotions from the very first chapter and you just ca n't stop till the final page i myself was dreading reaching the final page of spring snow as i knew that to read such a glorious book again may not come for a long while to me the book could have been twice the length and it still would have been too short but that 's the problem with things of such beauty and magnitude you never want them to end sadly you know they will and they must what they leave you with is unforgettable ! great !
most of what i read is modern the stories take place in the here and now and are it 's nice to read something '' where the words are important if this were a story of privileged young americans i would n't be interested but change the country and the era and the same story becomes interesting
this is the beginning of the posthumous work of mishima you will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with honda his flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions that even characters did not realized themselves so well are so elaborated and sometimes scare us it seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius but you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again
this book has made me a more confident mom every thing my son goes to do is so easy and i believe it is because of babywise he slept through the night for the first time at 6 weeks and was consistently sleeping through the night by 11 weeks he naps great and is so easy to take care of i have the babywise book and about to purchase the toddlerwise i recommend this book to any new mom who is seeking to get her baby on a schedule and it also contributed to me nursing my son for 7 months i was about ready to give it up when i read the book i felt like a human pacifier this book will encourage your baby to take the feedings at scheduled times
hi i am the mother of twin preemie fraternal twins which are now 8 months old my oldest twin weighed 2.4 and the youngest 4.8 lbs my boys were hospitalized for 6 weeks when we brought them home i thought wow i really have them on the right track my youngest boy would whale everynight no matter what i tried swaddling holding everything nothing worked until someone gave me this wonderful book i applied this book the night i recieved it i saw results immediately this book has taught us how important feeding on a 3 hour routine schedule everday was super important ! in the length they would sleep at night had my boys had healthy weights they would of been sleeping all thru the night starting at 7 weeks instead we had them sleeping thru at 3 months old we have such happy boys they smile all the time and to everyone they see so well mannered no tantrums this book is a god send and i recommend it to anyone if it works with twins it will work for anyone stick with it and you will be amazed i order every book they have written and it fantastic
this book is highly recommended by our church and all of our friends swear by this method it is a little on the strict '' side as far as scheduling goes we also read the baby whisperer '' which is more less rigid and are planning to take what works for us from each book as they both offer some great principles they both follow the same pattern routine of eat activity sleep then time for mom dad
after observing many parent friends and the sanity of their homes i decided babywise was definitly worth reading my friends with the happiest well adjusted and well behaved children use babywise my friends who oppose babywise and feel it is wrong or evil have never personally read the book from cover to cover but have only adopted the opinions of naysayers also many of these have children sleeping in their beds between mom dad until they are 4 years old are cranky needy chilren and live chaotic lives my husband and i read the book during my pregnancy and found it to be very balanced we implemented the suggested guidelines with flexibility as suggested and we 've had fantastic results our son has slept through the night in his own bed since 8 weeks when we lay him down for naps or bedtime he goes right to sleep when he wakes up he is full of smiles and giggles in the 8 months he 's been alive we 've flown with him 7 times and been on multiple road trips everyone we encounter says wow he is the happiest baby i 've ever seen '' and does he ever cry he travels so well '' through our travels and our business we 've met many docs and one child psychologist whom have expressed the same compliments about our son when i tell them we use babywise they often raise an eyebrow and express their disdane for this book and their opionion of it 's rigidity i recommended that they read it for themselves and not simply the opinions of naysayers the proof is in the pudding thank you gary ezzo for such a fantastic book ! !
i strongly recommend new parents thoughtfully consider baby wise in developing your parenting style now parents of a old we used parent directed feeding pdf from baby wise from the day we left the hospital and have been pleased with the results babywise claims that that the pdf method will often result in happy well adjusted satisfied children that are pleasant to be around we have found this to be the case my one gripe with the book is the lack of scientific empirical studies on the pdf parenting style unfortunately the book and i can only give anecdotal evidence of the merits of pdf based on personal experiences born in the percentile our little one was on a predictable schedule within a week consistently sleeping 7 hours through the night within 7 weeks and has been sleeping 11 hours at night since 12 weeks when in public we often get comments that our baby is so happy '' and content '' we go out to eat several times a week without more than smiles and laughs we have only left a restaurant once but were able to do so before he cried we 9 hours a day for a week in and out of the car times and our real estate agent never heard the baby cry no pacifier we have been on five plane trips without any more than a giggle and coo one friend was reluctant to hold our baby because she said that babies always cry when i hold them '' our little one was pleasant and smiley does our baby ever cry of course ! he cries at least one time every day usually during his predictable fussy time '' a 45 minute stretch before bedtime when he does cry diagnosing the problem is pretty simple with pdf i 'll let you read the book to find out how and i still have n't figured out how to differentiate types of crys as the hospital suggested just as indicated in baby wise after being put to bed at our little one wakes up at about singing and cooing and goes back to sleep within 30 minutes at he wakes up again and greets us with a smile when we walk in the room our baby gained weight and height predictably throughout his first few months moving into the percentile at his last visit my sister and several of our friends have used baby wise with similar results is baby wise for everyone probably not if you enjoy structure and organization and are accustomed to being on a regular schedule yourself your parenting style will probably mesh nicely with baby wise if you consider yourself a free spirit who enjoys responding to the unpredictability that life often brings then you will probably find baby wise to be restrictive to your parenting style in fact we have friends who did not use baby wise and ended up with happy pleasant children as well does baby wise cause babies to be pleasant and happy i do n't know but it did work for us and i can only imagine how difficult parenthood would be for us without the principles explained in the book
this is the best baby book i 've read i would highly recommend it this book shows how your baby will naturally sleep through the night by following the simple routine of baby eats baby has awake time and then baby sleeps it 's so simple it 's not any type of a strict routine you read your baby 's signals but at the same time teach the baby to eat play and sleep in blocks of time then your baby will naturally sleep through the night it 's that simple and it has helped me soooo much when i had my first son i had not heard of this book i thought i was doing the best thing by demand feeding etc unfortunately that resulted in my son not being able to sleep through the night until he was one year old eating multiple times at night and needing someone to lie down next to him so he could get to sleep what in the world was i thinking ! ! he could have been sleeping through the night in his crib by 3 months old instead i was totally sleep deprived having to wake up throughout the night to feed him give him a pacifier or by simply being awakened by his constant restless sleeping i now have 4 month old twins which both sleep through the night in their cribs life with twins and now my first son is two and using the babywise method is soooooo much easier than when i had my son and was using attachment parenting methods its amazing i did n't read babywise until the twins were about 8 weeks old i was feeling stressed and had no structure for the babies i was just trying to get through the day '' one of the babies would cry every 2 hours and i kept thinking he must be hungry then i would feed him but he would n't eat much and then he 'd cry again 2 hours later after reading the book i learned exactly what the problem was my son was tired not hungry he was waking up from his nap too early and needed to sleep longer i do n't know what i would have done without this book now when one of my babies cry i know exactly what the problem is and actually they rarely ever cry as the book explains just like you and me when babies get a good night sleep they feel refreshed and happy the next day my babies are rarely ever grumpy or fussy i 've had so many people act amazed at how content and happy they are i then just explain to them the simple routine of from babywise some people act like the baby knows best '' but they do n't ! they 're just a baby you as the parent need to help teach the baby how to sleep if people claim their baby was n't getting enough to eat then they were not following the book the book clearly teaches you if and when there is a problem my babies are chunky alert and happy now when i read about parents demand feeding and i just feel sorry for them because they 're making life alot more difficult for themselves eventually they wo n't want their kids sleeping in bed with them anymore and then the little guys do n't know how to go to sleep on their own when my twins start yawning i just lie them down in their cribs and they go to sleep i do n't have to help '' them get to sleep and demand feeding you 're just teaching your baby to snack all day and night then the baby does n't get a good sleep and so they wake up cranky and tired and want to sooth themselves by eating again its a bad cycle this book really is amazing there are also other books in the series that target specific baby ages as they get older i would also recommend baby whisperer by hogg but only as a supplement to babywise baby whisperer is not complete about the specifics of the routine do n't get mislead about some of the ezzo bashing its ridiculous and has nothing to even do with the content of the book i 've noticed that alot of demand feeding parents do n't like to be reminded that they or they 're babies are not sleeping through the night
to those who think this book recommends ignorning a hungry child just because he ate 2 hours ago rather than the prescribed 3 i suggest you read the book a little more carefully the feeding schedule is just a guideline and the book does emphasize in several places that when your child is hungry food should never be denied hunger cues should never be ignored parents read the book then make up your mind on whether or not this technique is one you want to adopt if you have n't read the book keep your opinions to yourself no one cares to know what you learned after doing a google search on the author if the information in the book makes sense to you and your pediatrician does n't disagree does it really matter in what subject the author earned his master 's degree
this book is about setting boundaries for your child at a young age i read the book in one sitting because it was fascinating and the next night after following the advice my son slept for 9 hours he was 4 months old he has consitently been a very well behaved happy and well adjusted child a routine established boundaries and yes even discipline gives your child confidence mommy actually knows what 's up ! ! i 've met moms who thought babywise was terrible '' and cruel '' but interstingly enough not a single one of them had actually read the book and guess what the same babies that decided their own schedules turned into toddlers and children that ran the household if you do n't teach your kids the rules and boundaries they will learn them the hard way by testing you the idea that this book is about starving your child or corporal punishment is just plain ridiculous ! ! do n't fall victim to the media venom !
seems like an easy enough subject but so many books like this are just fluffy ideas for employers to rah rah and lie to the employees said to say it 's true i 've known a lot of people who have really strugged with the career thing i knew a girl who went seven years without taking a vacation to impress her boss she got laid off the eighth year i read the transcript of an interview with this author and she just seemed to have something to say she even mentioned that people need to be paid for their work a tonic for all the of people who say working for free will get you good attention if you work for free your work is worth nothing
i 'm donald freeman former general manager of operations for sprint call center in phoenix az read more about don in fish tales by charthouse this books is a must for anyone currently involved in bringing fun into the workplace and a good book to place beside the book fish '' by charthouse i got real examples from companies and employees in this book that provided me with great ideas to use in my own business this book provides many detailed examples from companies who have found being productive is fun '' it provides real examples on how companies become a place where people care and where people count the book demonstrates the importance of celebrations that are honest and really are celebrations of being happy ! she provides a lot of insight and their are shared ideas that can be used that have little cost but really make a difference in terms of caring and making work fun ! it gives feedback from individuals who found the value and success in bringing fun to work '' if anyone has been challenged with using the fish philosophy as a tool for fun at work this book may be the ticket for making it all come together
begins with an ominous warning by ancient historian herodotus if a man insisted always on being serious and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it '' the rest of the book is an attempt to prevent these dire things from happening especially in the workplace the book is bubbly bubbly excitement prevails but near the end the author cautions us that excess is too much even when it comes to fun '' and i 'm sure a man as smart as herodotus would also say that if you have fun all the time with no seriousness at all that could be dangerous too
i do not know where to start i read nora roberts all the time and this is by far my favorite of her trilogies there is a little of everything sorcery vampires witches time travel battles and of course romance do not even think about it just get the book and find a quiet place to settle down and get started
some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if i had read them first i have enjoyed this book the vampire geall setting did not turn me off actually it was a nice change i enjoy contempory historical mystical and i guess vampire yeah nora for having more of a read than in some of your latest books
i 've been a nora roberts fan for years but originally was turned off by a review i 'd read for this book you see while i can deal with sorcery witches and the like as in the key trilogy and the island trilogy i have a hard time with fantasy worlds tell me we 're in scotland and i have an appropriate mental image but tell me we 're in geall and well i 'm really lost vampires or should we say vampyres i read interview with a vampire '' when it was originally published years before other people seemed to discover anne rice so i 'm okay with vampires too and the fantasy world thing do n't want to be a spoiler here but in this first book of the trilogy not much time was spent in geall i loved this book in fact i read it pretty much in one sitting i 'm surprised at some of the negative reviews glenna hoyt larkin moira cian king and blair what an army ! i instantly liked them and think their characters were well conceived and presented okay so maybe the romance was a bit on the quick side but it is fiction after all and given the types of men we 're talking about here i was thinking mcsteamy i think we can all believe in love at first sight ! only thing that could have made this book better is if i 'd known there was a glossary in the back before i finished ! i have the next two books in the series tucked away in a drawer ca n't decide whether or not to continue on now or wait a while actually i think what we have here is a page novel so maybe i 'll end this review here and go get dance of the gods '' and settle in for a long afternoon of reading in a fantasy world !
this book has been summarized often enough that i do n't think it will be necessary for me to give yet another summary i have to say that i am very surprised by so many negative to reviews for this book i loved it ! i found the key '' trilogy unreadable but the first book in this series was simply fantastic ! i think that the problem that people are having is that this book blends a couple of genres notably urban with romance therefore this book is neither an urban fantasy nor a romance but a story that contains elements of both i loved hoyt and glenna as characters but really other than the bad '' guys most of the people in this book are really well drawn characters with likable characteristics the introduction to the world and the characters was well done without being simply an intro '' book a story complete in itself this book drew me in and was impossible to put down ! i say that you should ignore the bad reviews unless you are romance purist or a fantasy purist that expects all of the conventions of those genres to be adhered to strictly if you like a great story with great characters action and romance then read this fantastic addition to nora roberts ' already outstanding booklist
this is book one of the circle trilogy hoyt mac cionaoith is a wizard that has failed to kill lilith a vampire queen that has turned his twin brother cian into one of her demons the goddess morrigan appears to hoyt telling him this was only the beginning and that he will have to find the five others that will help him with his quest to destroy lilith and her demons from taking over all the worlds she sends him to century new york where he is to find the witch the warrior the scholar one that shape shifts and the one that you lost the team hoyt is reunited with his brother cian moira the scholoar and larkin the from geall where lilith 's band has already terrorized their land glenna is the witch who has dreamed of hoyt last to join them is blair who is a demon hunter along with trying to work together so that they may defeat the vampires before samhaim it is also glenna and hoyt 's touching story of love the tale concentrates on these two characters as they both deal in the magical aspects of protecting the team the casting of their spells was done honorably without ever misusing the craft robert 's has penned a tale of myth magic and love all into one this paranormal romance will surely bewitch you i look forward to the next book in the series where i am sure we will learn more about the other characters of the circle
i am a big fan of nora roberts i love the ones that she writes with a touch of magick in them and this time she delivers in a big way witches vampires time travelers and of course romance this is the first of a triology centering around hoyt a wizard and his vampire brother cian they are brought together by morrigan the pagan goddess of war she gives them a mission save the world from lilith a year old vampire who just happens to be cian 's sire she tells hoyt that he must gather four more to complete the circle of heroes who will travel to geall another world where they will do battle with lilith and her army of vampires they have a very short time to train and prepare for this war which will take place on samhain the pagan name for the present day halloween hoyt meets his true love glenna in modern day new york city she is a witch with tremendous power together they prove to be an indomitable foe of the vamps usually roberts centers her stories around the romance but this time it is more about the situation that they are in the first book is mostly about how the group comes together and how they prepare for the mission given them i grew a little bored when they were training and such and that is the only reason i gave this book a four instead of five stars i would have liked a little more character development for each of them i did n't seem to connect with hoyt as much as i usually do with the heroes of a roberts book i really liked the description of glenna 's spells and her belief system she prefers the safety of a circle when casting her spells and roberts does a good job of describing her magick and the dangers of your powers being wiccan and a practicing witch i am appreciative of how roberts is careful of how she presents the craft and the old religion my daughter is reading the second one and tells me that it is really good too hey how can you go wrong with a book by nora roberts
i just love nora roberts but i have to say she has truly outdone herself with the latest the circle trilogy they are hard to put down great reading
when i heard nora had written another trilogy i was excited normally i ca n't wait to finnish them however i have only managed to get about halfway through this book i found it hard to from the past to the present and vampires just are n't my thing i suppose knowing me i 'll leave this for a couple months then try to read it again who knows i might end up liking the book after all
as a gay man growing up in a california suburb i felt isolated and alone during my formative years had i seen a book like this and learned that far from being alone i was part of a rich and wonderful cultural tradition i think it would have made a huge difference thanks to the authors of this book
lehane is a master of his genre and this offering is one of his best the story moves with riptide speed and each page brings new surprises and plot twists lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and does n't insult their intelligence at least most of the time bubba for example is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck lehane could n't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like bubba a plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused that 's why i like him and intend to read all his books
i really liked this book lehane has great character development you feel like these people are real patrick angie bubba got ta love that bubba ! ! more please lehane
lehane has outdone himself on this one starting with a seemingly sad unconnnected event the suicide of a client kenzie only spoke to once and then forgot to respond to her phone message kenzie begins a search for truth it will lead him back from the depressive edge of insanity that resulted from the events of 'gone baby gone ' and once again into the arms of angela gennaro hopefully for good what makes these five boston based mysteries so amazing is n't the tight plotting but it is the detailed descriptions of what his characters do and think there are very few characters and almost all of them are represented as real people the motivation to present everyone as more than just a shell is one of the hallmarks of lehane 's writing this is a well structured and even plausible story that builds to a climax just when it should but with lehane the ending always takes you back a step reminding you that there are no fairytale endings your never sure if anyone will live happily or be the same after it 's over
when a former client of patrick kenzie kills herself mere months after he warned off her stalker kenzie out of a profound sense of guilt investigates after reconciling with his former partner and lover angie gennaro the two stumble upon a the truth that the client was systematically stripped of everything in her life until she committed suicide the responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed and has now set his sights on kenzie and gennaro after the ambiguous villains of gone baby gone '' dennis lehane returns to a more traditional type of villain for his fifth book prayers for rain '' while nowhere the monstrous serial killer lehane created in darkness take my hand '' the second book in the series the villain of prayers for rain '' is sinister smug brilliant and sadistic inflicting pain and death because he can kenzie and gennaro in turn want to stop him out of a sense of justice and vengeance the tension mounts as the detectives must struggle to protect their own loved ones and safety while finding a the key to bringing down an invisible and brilliant killer as with the rest of this series lehane explores the basic theme of power who has it why they want it what they do to get it and what they do when they have it at the beginning of each novel the most powerful character is the villain they exercise their power violently harming people because they can and because their victims can not fight back it falls to kenzie and gennaro to exact revenge which is usually pretty gratifying if problematic since our society generally frowns on revenge nonetheless sometimes justice is not pretty and it 's understood that kenzie and gennaro are in the best position to fulfill that justice while prayers for rain '' is the last book for the time being lehane has not written a last '' book in a series it would be easy for him to pick up this series if he so chose i hope he does as i have enjoyed patrick kenzie and angie gennaro 's company for the past couple of years prayers for rain '' embodies much of what is great about this series and lehane as a writer it 's sharp taut intense funny and gripping
lehane strikes gold once again with this adventure although the reader must have realized by now that his titles do n't really have anything to do with the plot except gone baby gone mystic river and shutter island one ca n't deny the fact that lehane is one of the very best there is
i got hooked on lehane after mystic river and his thriller shutter island was absolutely gripping and completely i had to stay up late one night to finish that and i could n't sleep afterwards so i had to read a dave barry book to take my mind off it ! i should have learned my lesson because as soon as i got into prayers for rain i could n't get the creepiness and mystery out of my head and i once again had to stay up late to finish the entire book i 'm a snob who usually avoids genre fiction and i have a sneaking suspicion this might be found in the genre section but lehane is really a league above the other mytery writers i have read lehane is a masterful storyteller and has a rock solid plot here he 's very talented with the psychological aspects of crime very much so in shutter island i fear my review is becoming a big ad for that book ! and i wished he had further developed some of the psychological aspects in this book the lesson i 've learned about lehane is that he is such a good and creepy storyteller than i 'm no longer reading any of his books in bed late at night they are only to be digested when i am lying on the beach if you enjoy thrillers definitely get this book and be prepared to be blown away by a plot
this was by far the best novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down i was happy to see angie and patrick back together the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book i 'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane has n't published another it 's been 5 years i will be watching for it
the only thing i can say about dennis lehane is when 's the next one going to print '' for myself i thought 'prayers ' dialogue was a bit snappier more colorful than the others but that 's me one of the many things i enjoy about lehane 's writing is that he puts as much effort into the last ten pages as he did the first ten in detective and mystery stories that 's rare indeed
love this cookbook ! ! i already put in all of the recipies i want to try which is almost half the book ! SMILE i just made the carbanara and it was amazing ! ! ! i even have leftovers so i can have lunch tomorrow ! and it really only took me around 30 minutes to cook i was skeptical but i did it ! ! ! and trust me i do not cook ! this is all pretty new to me and something sparked in me to start cooking rachel ray was recommended and now i love her ! ! i think i 'll be purchasing all her books because i bet they are all just as wonderful ! ! i highly recommend this book to everybody and anybody ! ! i love the layout too i do n't have to look for sides because they are already there
this is a cookbook everyone should own my son who is normally picking loved the recipes in the book very easy to follow and have dinner ready in 30 minutes
great book and recipies however i need more simple recipes i should have purchased 30 minute
i love her shows and so i got this book i really love the recipes and they really are as easy to make as she says the only think i do n't like is that a lot of her ingredients are expensive i just ca n't afford all the gourmet ingredients her recipes call for that really disappoints me because i just ca n't make a number of her recipes but still a good buy
so far this book is as good as the first one i love rachel ray and her receipes i am retired and have recently takes a part time job again and find these tips she offers to be super easy and very healthy
just love this girl and her cooking and the book just adds to her recipes
this cookbook is just like her tv program on the food network easy to understand and the food is very yummy ! or as rachael would say yummo !
i got this book as a gift and at first i was a little skeptical she is sometimes a little too creative with the ingredients on her show for my liking when i finally got around to looking through the recipes i found myself bookmarking a lot more recipes than i ever thought i would there are fun recipes like fresh mozarella bites make sure to add a pinch of salt then there are some classic recipes like sloppy joes however she adds vinegar to the recipe which i had never heard of and after trying the recipe would never add again i would also add a little less brown sugar than she calls for and the cream cheese mashed potatos are delicious i would buy this book for myself if i had n't received it as a gift
i love this cookbook i try a new recipe just about every other night and so far i have found only one dud it is fresh has lots of taste and delicious i also love that the book is set up as meals so she provides the main course recipe and also recipes for sides and dessert to go with the main course there is a make your own takeout '' section a healthy eating '' section a fancy meals '' section and a section of foods that kids will eat there may be other sections too that i dont remember the food is generally ok for you but i modify a bit by using low sodium broth and skimp on some items she suggests to add to the dish also i am on a budget and ingredients required are very simple nothing too fancy or ! the best cookbook i ever bought ! but beware it takes more than 30 minutes
it has some over the top moments but all in all a new mother will be able to relate to a lot of it
i thought this book was well worth the read i passed it on to my other mommie friends who drink and they thought is was good also there were plenty of parts that i could say yes ! that 's me '' and other parts that were laugh out loud funny and shed a tear sad this would be a good book club book for mommies
this is the best mommy '' book i have read forget all the parenting magazines forget all the girlfriend guides anyone who has become a mommy and wonders where the wild girl she was before went must read this book i listened to the audiobook and it had me in stitches thank you brett paesel for your brutal raw and much needed honesty
this is the funniest best book i 've ever read about the thoughts and emotions of new mothers brett paesel has had the courage to publish thoughts that i do n't even admit i have even my husband who endured my reading it aloud to him enjoyed it and totally relates to the scenarios brett paints about her own husband i laughed and i cried and i recommended it to all the young women inside and outside my family who have babies
any adult can relate to the core story how does one resolve a decision your heart knows is right but which threatens the rest of your being here brett knows having a husband child and family was the right choice but she 'd like a second opinion what follows is a story of a woman searching for the answer she knows it out there the answer that is yes yes yes ! '' i also recommend the audio book version as read by the author
i thoroughly enjoyed this book it literally made me laugh out loud several times in fact i lost track of how many times my husband kept asking me what was funny this is a memoir where parts feel a bit exaggerated but are hilarious nonetheless the supposed main subject brett the author 's coming to grips with motherhood struggling to hold onto her self and remaining her own woman with ideas and thoughts independent of motherhood yet a lot of it is about the bizarreness of raising a child in hollywood preschool auctions where face lifts and breast jobs are up for grabs getting points '' to get into competitive magnet schools and there is a priceless scene where she and her husband get stoned out of boredom at her ' and end up raiding their children 's christmas stockings this is motherhood at its irreverent best
i do n't have children myself but i have several girlfriends with children the sweet relief i feel is knowing that the madness my friends experienced and i viewed with worry and concern is common and to be expected and who knew freakin ' hilarious i finished the book in one day i could not put it down i lauged at every turn of the page i ca n't wait to read it again
truly affecting it 's a book that crosses genres as i 'm not a parent but i was consistently moved and often laughed out loud i do n't often find a book that is actually difficult to put down '' but paesel keeps your attention with her insight and delicious wit it 's excellent
in a field littered with shoddily written confessional memoirs mommies who drink stands out as an excellent book across the boards it goes without saying that it 's funny and topical but there 's more to it than that i finished the book in one sitting a couple days later i picked it up and started again paying close attention to the writing in addition to her deadpan hilarity and keen eye paesel brings tremedous skill to the page there 's an economy of language and precision in the composition that strengthens the humor and pace but also rivets the reader 's attention when she moves seamlessly from comic narrative to poignant observation in fact the realizations offered flow organically from the comedy the one depends on the other i was thankful to discover that the book is completely free of cynicism and hipster attitude it is instead an open and big hearted book that is filled with sentiment but not at all sentimental this funny tender expertly written memoir stands up to and invites repeat readings a sure sign of quality writing
loved this book not only the wry observations of what happened but the touching poignant love of her children loved the quip about why do people think that not talking a lot when you 're in small town is a virtue zipped through it and laughed out loud
excellent storey suzanne brockmann stays true to the contiuation of the navy seals have n't read a book yet by her i have n't enjoyed
brockmann is absolutely one of my top 3 authors this book delivers another great combination of story lines and characters the current and former members of seal team 16 are revisited and in fact pitted against each other this book focuses on mark jenkins who has only been peripherally involved in some of the other books in this series also there is a new installment on the relationship between sophia ghafari and lawrence decker who were the focus of a previous book
the pace was a little slow to beginn but picked could n't put the book down once it picked up and read it in 1 everybody got wet at some point and time and the banter was out loud funny and when will we stop the short stories and get another book on sam and alyssa thats what i hungery pass the time this will do pull out the past books on troubleshooters inc to keep up with whos whos
suzanne brockmann never disappoints her story lines are always original and her romance always steamy brockmann has built a family of characters her readers have learned to care about it just keeps bringing me back again and again to find out whose book will be next
this was a great book it has page turning suspense and some comedy this is one of the best books i 've read in a while i really enjoyed lindsey linds '' and mark jenks '' but izzy definitely added fun to the book
read this book you 'll know the reasons why people succeeded in the century and will keep on doing so in the century their people skills not technology
although the title does not quite do the book justice this book more relevant for today 's business world than any in the past five years networking '' has taken on a negative connotation in the recent past but ferrazzi shows how sincerity is the most important aspect of bringing people into your own network
i do a lot of networking around town it is often that i will meet people and share coffee with someone and then i will not continue to keep in touch with them in the book never eat alone keith ferrazzi writes about how to keep in touch with the people you know he has creative ideas about working your circles having productive social gatherings networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new
i thoroughly enjoyed listening to these cd 's they are full of good information and practical suggestions my husband and i both enjoyed them and are now hosting our own dinner parties
overall this was a really good book like any business book you need to apply what you read rather than just read it for the advice to work and everything in this book will work the only reason for this not receiving 5 stars was the name dropping began to get a little old at least for me i understand that it drives the point home about what someone who came from humble beginnings can accomplish through networking but not everyone wants to hear every famous person the author is friends with and ariana huffington is the last person i would be bragging i had over for dinner
i 'll be honest even though i chose this book myself i was very skeptical when i first approached it there is something in the title that challenged my status quo i am introvert and our society tends to value extraverted nature i was afraid that this book would repeat this extraversion mantra all over again and i could n't have been more wrong what i found was volumes of invaluable advice ! keith ferrazzi is most definitely an extrovert of the most extreme kind but his philosophy is invaluable to both camps he argues for building relationships not contacts it is not a quid pro quo process nor a one way street it 's going out of your way to expand your own horizons and to appreciate other people relationships are about what you give charm as he points out is simply being yourself you need to have a dream you need to be audacious at times you need to add value to everything you do you do need to position yourself and have a unique point of view in the end what else could we wish for if not having a job we love with people who know us for who we really are if that is what networking is all about then count me in ! not even two weeks after i 've read this book i found myself applying these principles in my own life and guess what it works ! it 's a great book i think everyone will take a different lesson from it and i would give it six stars if i could
out of work stuck in a job you do not like stuck in a life you do not like then run out and get keith ferrazzi 's superb never eat alone '' ferrazzi provides practical how tos '' on expanding one 's thinking and subsequently one 's life through networking i have spent countless hours working with professionals and executives many know how to write a resume call search firms and prepare for interviews but few know how to network and networking is the key to finding a fulfilling job and life with ferrazzi 's book i now have a resource to recommend never eat alone '' is organized into four sections the mind set the skill set turning connections into compatriots and trading up and giving back each section is packed with good proven common sense advice people who have succeeded in their careers and life will if they read this book endorse what ferrazzi recommends it is at the core of success in life networking is not a endeavor something you do when you are need rather it is a way of life and is based on doing something for others without the expectation of getting something in return ferrazzi shows us how going the extra mile for others leads to unexpected rewards
i feel obliged to share my review of this book i got hold of it by chance and what luck ! like a lot of people i know the value of building relationships because most of the best business i 've had have been from by circle of contacts however i cringe at the concept of networking '' and fail miserably at trying to leverage my network this book however got me to understand the difference between networking and relationship building i wo n't spoil it for you but once you read the book and understand the difference you will immediately change you view of building relationships that unimaginably augment your financial professional social and philantropic efforts do yourself a favour and buy this book !

i have read and been a fan of robb since i first opened one of her books several i have read '' as audiobooks and this one was as geat an experience as the others the reading of the book was well done and the voices '' excellent really adds to your listening enjoyment one of my favorite ways to take a car trip now is with a robb audiobook
as always robb aka nora roberts gives a solid performance in origin in death the only negative thoughts i have on the book are that many of the events are clearly over the top with multiple clones and underground explosions usually the in death books reflect the gritty reality of 2059. origin in death was much more star trek than star wars the early years otherwise a solid writing effort from roberts
eve dallas is catching killers once again in this installment of the in death series the story is great with two identical murders of father and son body sculpters it 's up to dallas along with her amusing cop sidekicks and of course her hot husband roark to find out whodunit the book starts off great but toward the end begins to drag with so many details about cloning illegal experiements and politics the ending is a bit not giving away any details kids and so unrealistic that it took me a while to get through it an unusual occurance for me still this is a read and certainly worth a turn of page
most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses baseball is a team sport that captures the american spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game likewise a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the talley in moneyball michael lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game like real life this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the sports page every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics there is the pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the la angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and business managers can profit from and enjoy
this is a perfect example of edutainment at its best terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable it highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit as opposed to how pretty '' an athelete is or how much charisma they have for people who believe that the usa is as close as any country to being a meritocracy this book is a shining example of just that i am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews i have read i ca n't wait for lewis to write his next book
money ball was a great book it shows that you do n't need money to win in baseball take that yankees SMILE michael lewis reavels that the team with the lowest payroll the oakland athletics can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team lewis also tells the story of billy beane the gm of the athletics billy 's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the mlb he exerts his attitude as a force over the experts '' when a desicion must be made billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of he shows that there are many aspects of the game that we do n't know all in all this was an excellant book my only complaint was that there was a lot of jesse hartman
if you are a fan this is a great read if you are not a fan but just interested in the game it is still a great read what i find most amusing are the baseball experts '' who billy bean 's approach to fielding and running a baseball team the proof of the pudding is in the eatin ' '' and the cognocenti appear to dislike the taste the oakland a 's have been one of the stellar teams yet it appears that success is not what is important what is important is success based on the recipe that the experts '' write
how is it that the oakland a 's have won the al west in 2000 2002 2003 and are all but assured of winning this year 2006 as well as the wild card in 2001 even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll that is the narrative that michael lewis uses to tell the story of his book moneyball one of the central tenets of moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued can with some specificity predict certain players ' performances in certain areas it is however only half the story and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you old news the real story that moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up lewis repeatedly describes how the old boys club of major league owners who lewis affectionately refers to as the women 's auxiliary players and journalists former cincinnati red and current espn commentator joe morgan is appropriately skewered reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like billy beane the book 's main protagonist and current a 's gm bill james dick cramer and others and on the old boys club the point is lost that objective statistics have the potential to give teams who can not afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players the best chance of winning when people point to the fact that the a 's have not won the world series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years roughly since 1999 is when moneyball makes its point
i 'm not a baseball fan hockey is the game of my heart baseball no way but i loved this book the only other baseball book that i 've ever read that comes close to this mark is ball four by jim bouton funny and interesting in its own right a real joy to read great characters and insight to management a wonderful story about tearing down a culture from the inside and who can argue with the oakland a 's success here it is september 2006 and they 're once again leading their division 5 games up on the angels and this is the inside track on how they 've done it with one of the worst payrolls in baseball
when i was growing up i devoured any book written about baseball as i 've gotten older my passion for the game has waned though still a fan i 'd not read a baseball book in several years until i finally got around to reading this one reading moneyball four years after the events occured sheds new light on things the first portion of the book focuses on the personality and playing history of general manager billy beane and then has an inside look at the 2002 amateur draft where many of beane 's philosophies are put into action beane is ecstatic when scott kazmir and prince fielder are selected by other teams thus allowing him to get the player he covets nick swisher swisher has panned out nicely for the a 's jeremy brown the other draftee lewis focuses on has not had the success anticipated he had his first big league at bat just last night the rest of the book has some interesting moments as well there is a lengthy discussion of sabrmetrics and the role bill james and others have played in shaping the a 's philosophy also a couple of really interesting profiles of scott hatteberg and chad bradford which shed some light on the strange paths some people take on their way to major league baseball lewis focuses a lot of attention on paul depodesta the assistant gm for the a 's in fact without saying so directly i get the impression that lewis feels he 's at least equally responsible for the a 's successes depodesta has since gone on to an unsuccessful sting with the los angeles dodgers reading the book a few years after the fact gives some perspective on some of the mistakes that beane and the a 's have made with some player decisions but despite those mistakes the bottom line is that the franchise has continued to excel despite being dramatically outspent and despite the fact that the rest of baseball has been clued in '' to the a 's thinking as an aside i find it interesting that all of the attention has been paid to beane and the a 's this is well deserved for sure but lost in all of this is the fact that the minnesota twins have been equally frugal and nearly equally successful how have they done it it might make for an interesting book itself any true baseball fan even a somewhat lapsed baseball fan such as myself should do a favor and pick up this book it may even rekindle some interest in the game we grew up
field of stats although the steroid scandal may have eventually accomplished the same thing moneyball '' destroys any persistent romance surrounding professional baseball it 's an antidote to all those paeans glorifying the love of the game the natural '' field of dreams '' even the raunchy lens of bull durham '' players do n't rise and fall due to the nobility of their character the sheer beauty of their swing the sage advice of a wizened baseball scout or even their batting average per se what moneyball does is show how the oakland a 's and a few emulators dismissed all this lore and culture in favor of multiple regressions and other advanced statistical tools it 's a fascinating book that could have been a dry one full of detailed statistics and equations except that lewis cleverly balances the mathematical perspective with the same character studies that have graced sports biographies for years the book centers around former big league prospect billy beane a man with great athletic ability who did n't make it in the bigs partly because of his perfectionism and resulting temper years later beane is the general manager of the oakland athletics a team with stingy owners who 'd rather save some bucks than buy a pennant see yankees the '' faced with a shoestring budget and enamored with the new baseball analysis cultivated by bill james in his baseball digest '' system beane and his advisors invest in players as if they 're brokers on wall street james and other baseball fanatics often from harvard often lawyers or scientists with a mathematical bent discover that the old wisdom was n't all that smart their analyses yield cold objective facts and suddenly as in the old firesign theater '' skit everything you know is wrong '' it 's not batting average and rbis that are most important it 's and slugging percentage that predict the one thing the only outcome that matters who wins throw out fielding statistics these are too dependent on luck and the kind of pitches served up furthermore invest in bargains overlooked players who get to first through walks rather than singles the phrase a walk is good as a hit '' was never so true as it is here guys who are n't great players but who fill complete missing elements in your roster sort of like diversifying your portfolio beane and others take their cue from a market mechanism known as derivatives '' and those who otherwise do n't fit into other gms ' and scouts atheoretical notion of what makes a great player the results are convincing with one of the least expensive teams in baseball the a 's repeatedly make the playoffs beane acquires college players and castoffs from other teams like a man who collects trashy art and xxx shows how his i must be insane to offer you these bargains '' style of purchasing ball players pays off mostly through chapters devoted to one particular exemplar of beane 's philosophy there are a few problems with the book as there are a few problems with the approach to building your team the most egregious of these is lewis ' concentration on the successes predicted by statistics for a book driven by science lewis ignores the other 3 cells of the implicit table of by uses beane method '' '' does n't use method '' the most significant is the method cell lewis just does n't write about those players who did n't pan out as mathematically predicted the only examination of failure is beane 's rather clinical excuse for never advancing very far in the playoffs in a short series when n is small luck the statistical error tends to become more powerful and empirical truths '' suffer as a result the fans suffer too but their enjoyment of the game is always secondary to winning therefore athletics almost never steal bases the percentages dictate no and managerial and player judgment is minimized in favor of the all mighty victory you have to admit it works but when beane shrugs off the failure question almost with a that 's not my job '' you have to wonder whether moneyball '' is enough maybe it 's just the best oine can do on a budget on the other hand xxx lewis to mention even in his most recently written epilogue that beane 's right hand man paul depodesta was fired after 2 seasons with the dodgers a place finish in 2005 did n't help depodesta along with this bias towards success stories xxx reveals a few bad writing habits he 'll sometimes describe something with sentences repeatedly beginning with the word that '' as in that the book does n't look enough at failures that the book was a best seller that the book was reportedly misunderstood by many when published '' lewis also lapses into a ' prose style somewhat emulating king james '' bill james of the pioneering baseball digest school of analysis still moneyball '' deserves its reputation and its sales beane 's approach is n't always pretty but it makes sense and meets the bottom line of both winning and preserving capital an excellent and accessible book that has it both ways an argument for using cold '' higher math in sports and a spirited study of the ballplayers who add value to the original purchase and the gms who know what it takes to buy low and sell high
lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach used by billy beane and the oakland athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of primarily on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers this approach generated a number of divisional championships for oakland in the weakest american league division but no pennants and world are omitted variables and misspecification problems in the sabermetrics statistics approach of bill james used by james 's system totally ignores the number of batter outs are not flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an are thus the worst type of omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1 to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over for a regular everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the second problem is that the james system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball category is that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts walks where the runner is able to steal second walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out times a year and hits but has a obp james 's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors
this book was my introduction to sabermetrics and proved to be quite a thrilling introduction the application of truly smart statistical work the game of baseball in billy beane and the oakland a 's had me hooked from page one great material it did seem to drag on a little however the first half of the book was thrilling the end started to feel like more of the same old same old but it 's still worth finishing
i have read all of the books in this series of precious and her adventures in the no 1 ladies detective agency the first book was not what i expected at all i am an avid detective and mystery novel reader i found the first book in the series was slow at first with lots of background on botswana but after i finished the book i found that i truly enjoyed it i gave it to my 80 year old mother and she too liked the book very much ! she still asks me if there is anew one in the series that is a good sign i have read each novel in order although that is not necessary as they each stand alone i have come to love precious and her family and employee the books are well written interesting and really they are more about life in a country i have never visited and a life i know nothing about i enjoy looking into precious ' life many thanks to the scottish professor and his series of no 1 ladies ' detective agency
i really enjoy the authors insights into the minds of the characters the whole series is delightful and easy reading i hope there is another book in the works
the no 1 ladies 's detective agency are always uplifting books in their praise of the simple life lived by its characters in botswana in thisnovel again there are a couple of mysteries that are cleverly presented and solved with the focus on the human beings behind the stories and their feelings the cases are what you would expect in real life as items that would need solving but the presentation is what makes this series of books a joy to read
if you have never read one of the 1 ladies detective agency books i highly encourage you to read them in order before you get to this one they are all outstanding and introduce a variety of interesting characters who are all well known by the time this book starts this book starts with a new character aunty emang the african version of dear abby precious ramotswe takes an instant dislike to aunty emang due to the curt advice she dishes out a variety of interesting side stories develop but you know aunty emang will come back before the end of the book and it is a humdinger of a conclusion enjoy it with a cup of bush tea i do n't know why mr can not bring the same charm he draws out of africa to his other series but anyway you got ta cherish the 1 ladies detective agency and hopefully we will get many more books in the series
for years i was mystified by the popularity of seinfeld '' the comedy about nothing nothing of any substance ever happened and the protagonists were a bunch of shallow jerks the no 1 ladies ' detective agency series adopts the seinfeld '' motif but here we have a seinfeld '' of a superior sort nothing much happens in the stories but the protagonists are a group of admirable characters seinfeld worked through mundane situations with the hurrah for me the heck with you '' attitude that scars so much of postmodern secular society in contrast mma ramotswe and her cadre of of friends confront the mundane with humble dignity and depth of character if you the reader can come away from the stories without feeling a deep affection and respect for mma ramotswe 's circle of friends you are indeed the success of the series can be attributed to the effectiveness with which alexander mccall smith mines the same comedic vein so well done in the rumpole stories large repertorie cast engaging but flawed protagonists observations of the human condition and all leavened with good humor and good will in this latest installment mma ramotswe again confronts situations which are at once funny thought provoking and compelling and she handles them with skill and savy smith even works in a of sherlock holmes ' deductive methods as mma ramotswe attempts to apply them with mixed results
the ladies detective agency series are each a jewel in their own right and this most recent addition is no different what lies within the pages of this book is the opportunity to be transported to the main character 's simple wisdom and curiosity filled life in botswana be ready to be transported on a great mini vacation when you read this book
one of the best things about alexander mccall smith 's entertaining no 1 ladies ' detective agency series is that these are n't really traditional detective stories at all one must read between the lines to see that the amusing tales delve far deeper than solving simple mysteries and crimes each book provides an enchanting glimpse into the life and times of botswana and the series really serves as a clever study of human nature the loveable and heavyset chief detective mma ramotswe is clearly large and in charge as her unique agency helps its clients and the stories ' readers themselves discover many things they already know '' this charming series is excellent light reading and especially great for planes take the whole series with you to make a transatlantic flight go by in the blink of an eye !
mulholland 's text is a very readable and approachable primer about using scripture for spiritual formation one of the things i especially appreciated was his definition of spiritual formation that formed the foundation for his text he refutes those who want to use scripture or any 'technique ' to become more spiritual for their own sakes mulholland points the reader to a focus outside of themselves he maintains that spiritual transformation must be for the sake of others and not ourselves
i came to this book with the advantage of having sat under mulholland in courses including 2 on biblical exegesis the title of this book shaped by the word '' is 100 representative of his view of scripture mulholland very effectively teaches us that we should approach the scriptures with our hearts and our minds full expecting to be shaped by the work of god through his word mulholland effectively communicates to us that when we always lead our study of scripture with reason our hearts will not be formed as god intends
mulholland 's insistance that we are capable of letting go of what we know in order to freshly approace the scriptures with the intent of allowing ourselves to be shaped by god 's word is the premise of this excellent book i lend it to friends but make certain i retrieve it the author describes the path he has personally trod in his attempt to realize his full god given potential examples illustrate his struggle to distinguish the critical difference between the accustomed reading of scripture for information and the life changing willingness to read for personal spiritual formation i am grateful for having discovered this fine author and recommend this book to anyone interested in signposts to guide their spiritual journey

the one percent doctrine by ron suskind published by simon and schuster 2006 367 pages is a great piece of investigative reporting it goes in depth into the inside world of politics and policies before the table of contents suskind chose to put a quote from thomas jefferson whenever the people are they can be trusted with their own government '' this quote serves as a good tone for the book the one percent doctrine is not a bush '' bashing book or something written for shock value rather a book of information to help the american public by keeping others informed through investigative reporting suskind is continuing one of americas greatest constitutional rights on a time when personal freedoms are being questioned every day suskind has had a long career in investigative reporting fifteen years ago and since the bush administration took office has focused on reporting on the white house in 1993 he began working for the wall street journal until 2000 when he was then the senior national affairs reporter while working there he won the pulitzer prize for feature writing as well as became a new york times best selling author the title of this book comes from a theory that dick cheney created the doctrine states that if there is just a one percent chance of something happening regarding the war on terror '' the united states is to act as if it was a certainty cheney himself said that the war on terror '' was not about the analysis '' rather the united states response '' however this is one of the biggest flaws in policy that the book points out the book begins on the day after the attacks on september and takes you through the inner workings of the american political system for the next three years it talks about the response to the attacks regarding al queda afghanistan and ultimately the war in iraq suskind divulges intimate knowledge of who knew what regarding the false information given the american public about iraq a lot of this information has become more public knowledge but at the time the book was published in early 2006 but the book goes into great detail that few others have the new york times called the book an invaluable contribution both to the historical record and to the fierce public debate over the nature of the bush administration 's true views and motivations on issues of war and peace '' as a historical record it is important for americans now and generations after to know the truth and as far as the bush administration 's true views the cold hard facts presented are hard to argue with knowing what our lawmakers and elected officials are doing allows us to hold them accountable for their actions and is part of the process that has been in place since america was a country we need this kind of reporting to inform the public what is really going on so we can do our job as unites states citizens one of the most reveling things about this book is that it put the pieces together and shows that if congress or the american people knew everything that was going on behind the scenes america would never have gone to war with iraq congress can not do its job if it is not presented with all of the information needed to make an informed decision now it is one of the biggest political issues that has been putting politicians in an election year on the hot seat many senators and congress people who originally were for the war in iraq have been pulling their support for years especially when it was reveled that most of the intelligence the bush administration gave as reasons to go to war were misleading false and much of it made up although the bush administration has been quick to point to other reasons for the diminishing support for the war using catch phrases like '' is simply not the case this is a word that has been far over used and it is important for americans to note the difference between the of politicans and the need to change their opinions as more information surfaces regarding the intelligence in support of the war this is how congress does its job and it is better to have someone in office that can admit they were wrong and fix the situation instead of not doing anything and staying the course '' free speech and press are some of our most important rights and are a key factors in separating our democracy from a dictatorship along with freedom of speech and press the constitution provides a system of checks and balances to assure there is no abuse of power from the president the system also includes a process called impeachment which allows for a series of steps to be taken for the removal of a president through suskind 's investigation of the bush administration several impeach able offences that were committed by bush and his staff have come to light regardless if a trial is set up or not bringing the information from inside the white house to the public gives the chance to correct the situation and americans can act as they see fit the important part is to have the information to be available through venues like the press so that we are able to make the best choice if we as a country allow one of our rights to be taken away there is northing to stop it from happening again and if we do not know about what is going on in the first place then we lose our ability to act at all america has already had the patriot act pushed upon us which all but eliminates the probably cause needed according the our fourth amendment in the bill of rights for any type of searches then america was faced with the illegal wiretapping the bush administration set up and used on everyday americans and their friends and family overseas recently president bush signed the military commissions act of 2006 into law this allows for the president to hold people indefinitely without charge sentence people to death based on poor intelligence and take away the basic human rights of those detained the most controversial and disturbing part of the bill is that it allows the president to eliminate habeas corpus and eliminates most of the bill of rights it is so important to know the information presented in the book that the book was originally recommended to me by a united states senator currently in office united states senator stabenow from michigan recommenced the book based on what a good book it was on the subject of the war in iraq between the one percent doctrine the renewal of the patriot act and the military commissions act of 2006 there fewer and fewer choices left for americans right now we are at a time where we have the choice to sit by idly or get informed outraged and take action suskind ends his the book with another quote this time that is uniform in middle eastern as well as western religions the quote is from deuteronomy justice justice this you must pursue '' as ron suskind states justice is an overused word these days i implore all to find the real meaning of justice and pursue it for yourself
this is a book that every american should read it gives previously unknown or little known details on the 'war on terror ' among some of its revelations are the one percent doctrine was spelled out by dick cheney and says that in the 'war on terror ' if there is a one percent chance of an attack happening our response needs to be as if there is a 100 chance of it happenning it was driven by the new arithmetic of this conflict even one successful attack can be devastating but there are many potential ones and being 100 sure the attack will happen is going to be almost impossible the leader of the london 711 subway plot was a known terrorist conspirator who was refused entry into the us bin al shibh was tortured but did not break khalid sheikh mohammed ksm was tortured and he was told his children would be harmed but he did not break abu zubaydah the first 'high level ' captive was crazy with 3 split personalities and actually just took care of travel arrangements for the us military deliberately bombed the afghan offices of al jazera to put pressure on the organisation resulting in information from the qatari leader that lead to ksm 's capture there was a cyanide attack plot by an affiliated organisztion that was in the final stages in the us but it was not authorized by and plenty more the other interesting insight from the book is the shift in the way the presidency operates with george w bush previous presidents would rely on the advice and recommendations of their government agencies but george w bush decides based on 'gut instinct ' then asks for supporting evidence from the agencies pretty scary !
the one percent doctrine is a fascinating chilling look at the war on terror from the viewpoint of those on the inside it 's unsettling because it reveals the stark choices an open society faces in choosing to fight a war in the shadows it 's an accounting of the efforts of people caught by the tsunami of 911 struggling to come up with a response faceless bureaucrats academics politicos intelligence professionals law enforcement the military et al there are failures all too well known 'successses ' that were n't and victories left unheralded it 's a conflict the had n't prepared for against an enemy that had been ignored and was largely unknown who are they and what are they going to do next where the one percent doctrine details how people came together to answer those questions and are still trying to answer them today the battlefield keeps shifting if you 've read suskind 's previous book the price of loyalty '' you 'll be getting a parallax view of the administration here there are heros and villains extremely capable people and incompetent hacks and people just trying to do the best they can with the tools at hand so much depends on the personal in this conflict that the element of chance is critical all too often compare what 's in this book against what 's been shown on the news shouted from the campaign platforms argued over by the pundits and you wo n't sleep well tonight but you 'll have a better understanding of what the stakes really are how real the threats are and just what kind of job bush and the administration have been doing
everyone should turn off their tv 's for a few hours and sit down and read this book simply the most informative book i 've read this year
very scary and enlightening we 'll drawn word pictures there was almost not attribution of information though
the material presented in this book is absolutely fascinating while much of it has been covered elsewhere there are details of the inner workings of the bush administration and the cia that are things that are unique to this book truly a fascinating read it 's a pity then that suskind felt he needed to present this book like it 's a spy novel each conversation is written out word for word and each encounter is given as the version in addition when he does analyse the implications of various encounters he is rather repetitive i think it loses credibility when presented like a novel despite this it is a fascinating read
ron writes another riveting story of 'the decider ' aka gw bush everyone should read this book particularly those who voted for him in 2000 and again in 2004. anyone with a logical brain and half history of the me region could anticipate that the foray into iraq was misguided at best and a breach of trust at worst america will need years to recover from this fiasco another fine book as well as all the lives and money squandered in this poor attempt at a war on terror
this book reads extremely fast the page layout is attractive just like the magazine but alas this arrangement includes a lot of white space many of the tips are too familiar sprinkling lemon juice on your fruit salad to prevent browning and some advice is applicable only to homeowners or parents i am neither yet still there is enough novel advice to make this volume worthwhile for a poor student who appreciates tips for organizing and entertaining i recommend this for a housewarming gift note book is hardcover
i 'm a fan of real simple magazine so this book hit the spot for me it gives you ideas for reusing items now i know what to do with the stack of dryer sheets that i 'd been saving there are inexpensive tips and lots of advice some may sound familiar but there 's bound to be some you had not thought of before
i like real simple '' magazine but i do n't like saving the back issues i have enough clutter believe me so the editors of this excellent magazine have compiled all kinds of tricks and ideas into this single volume it 's a lot of fun to read and has some very helpful stuff for keeping your home in order the chapters include 1. grooming 2. getting dressed 3. in the kitchen 4. in the office 5. cleaning 6. decorating 7. entertaining 8. celebrating 1. grooming includes how to unclog your drain i am going to go try this my bathroom sink is not draining properly here you dump a cup of baking soda down and add a gallon of boiling naturally the grooming section is homemade recipes for face scrub toothpaste and fun ideas like freezing aloe vera gel for sunburn relief if you know you are just going to go get burnt you might as well prepare 2. getting dressed has hints on mending washing dainty things 3. in the kitchen not the best part of the book i thought some basic recipes and how to use a wine bottle as an emergency rolling pin 4. in the office someone peeked in my desk drawer at work because there is a suggestion for supplies like toothbrush and toothpast and a lint roller plus some basic makeup i have this they did n't find the hair dryer and shampoo i keep in the office bathroom in case i get drenched or sweated out and have to do my hair over at another suggestion spare house keys ! good idea 5. the cleaning section has a stain removal guide probably worth the book for this alone 6. decorating lots of tips but most useful how to paint a room 7. the entertainment section has fun things like freezing berries to make colorful ice cubes for summer drinks and how to buy for a cocktail party the book ends with all the marvelous things you can do with dental floss aside from flossing between your teeth good for the or apartment couple this is a pretty volume that would make a welcome gift for just about anyone
nice illustrations and pictures makes this dictionary very interesting for kids it
i bought this book for two sets of grandchildren i had an opportunity to spend some time leafing through it with them the merriam webster children 's dictionary is in my opinion more than a dictionary it is also like an encyclopedia it does more than define words it also uses great photos and illustrations to enlighten children and adults alike one could spend hours just randomly sampling the pages i 'm sure it will be a very useful tool for the kids all through their elementary school years i wish i had this book when i was a kid !
i ordered this for my son who homeschools we are doing grades combined next year and this dictionary is perfect for elementary reference skills he likes the colorful pictures and i think that the alphabet tabs on the page edge will be very useful to him when looking up words quite a nice book for the price
most dk products for children are outstanding and this is one of them well illustrated and comprehensive it is a large hard back not a small desktop reference it is for third graders and up the type is small and hard to read for children in lower grades but my first grader loves the book because it is rich in features that fascinate him even though it is hard for him to read he enjoys the flag section in the back and he enjoys the first rate gazetteer also in the back though it is for more advanced students it is an invaluable tool for parents who have first and second graders and who assist or tutor their children when children are first learning to read they encounter many new words and they frequently ask parents what those words mean it is challenging for parents to tell children the meaning of a word in terms that are simple enough for a child to understand this dictionary is very helpful in that respect while this dictionary has many illustrations it would be more effective if it had more but that is not a significant shortcoming however i would not use this dictionary as the first dictionary i would recommend dk children 's illustrated dictionary as a starter it is not nearly as comprehensive but it is simpler and better illustrated on individual words for example the larger dictionary does not illustrate what a pot is but the children 's dictionary does it costs about the same as the merriam webster children 's dictionary but it is worth the cost there is also a my first dictionary by susan miller which is also simpler and is easy for a beginner to use but it has only a words the explanations of the words are good but it does not include several of the features of the children 's illustrated dictionary what could make this dictionary more useful would be an a table of contents for pages that contain only illustrations or consist mainly of illustrations on a particular subject often one can find a definition for an item such as an animal but not find an illustration of that animal only to later find the illustration on an illustrated page of animals such a table of contents is inclused in dk children 's illustrated dictionary which is useful
i highly recommend this as a first dictionary for school age children i purchased this for my first grader and she loves it ! it is compiled of great illustrations and filled with so much information she will use this book for years
this is a really good dictionary for kids gave it to the neighbor 's old and she loved it it has lots of pictures and a pretty extensive vocabulary so it 'll get used for years
this dictionary is indispensable for developing young minds who inquire at every turn what does mean '' the beautifully illustrated glossy cover advises that the contents include entries and over illustrations this makes it a great vocabulary resource as well as being down right entertaining for kids the pictures and illustrations are vividly colored natural not cartoonish and very attractive the publisher says this dictionary is designed for ages 8 and up but why wait until then to buy it for your little scholar there are 911 pages with many aids for learning the typography is clear easy to read and printed on very sturdy paper one of the handiest features is the color coded indexing that helps you find the letter of the alphabet by looking at the open edge of the book there 's a simple guide to pronunciation printed at the bottom of each page but it 's only two pages wide and then reprinted on each page one of my favorite features is the encyclopedic topical renderings that are interspersed throughout the dictionary these give the young reader a look at a word with added details such as the context of the word and other valuable perspective for example the entry for baseball '' not only provides a definition of the word as the ball '' and the game '' but also illustrates the equipment used to play the game and shows the positions on the field our family has had this book for more years than i can remember and it has held up to exceptionally hard use which makes it an excellent value in my opinion even when your kid '' progresses so far in the english language that he or she says it 's juvenile '' you will still find him or her sneaking a peek at the definitions because if the word appears in this book you can be assured it will be simply understandable
i have a 6 and 8 year old who love this book ! my boys are able to look up words and understand the definitions without it being too easy '' the illustrations are great too !
a lot has already been said about this novel so i 'll address my review to those unfamiliar with mccarthy 's work if you 've never read mccarthy before this is a great place to start the plot is tight engaging and easy to follow and the language is gorgeous if you enjoy this book and want to move on to others read the others in the border trilogy before tackling blood meridian '' some people will take issue with mccarthy 's grammar sentence structure use of spanish and punctuation or lack thereof mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning the sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and breath '' meaning that they do n't always look or sound like conventional prose this will be displeasing to some as an example the first line of the book reads the candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door '' now mccarthy could have just as easily said the candle flickered when he entered the room '' or something like that but the effect aurally is just not the same read the first page of the book if you do n't catch fire at the beauty of it then maybe this book and mccarthy 's work in general is not for you
all the pretty horses is what i would imagine it would be like if ernest hemingway wrote a western very rich language and vivid imagery yet simple and direct dialogue not an especially complex plot and nothing unnecessary throughout yet very deep emotionally i 'm eagerly making my way through the rest of the border trilogy and finding mccarthy a little more verbose and allegorical in the crossing but all the pretty horses has no wasted words in telling a fantastic story
dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather the divorce of his parents and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up john grady cole heads for mexico with his friend lacey rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen they find a hard darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer cole is scrupulously ethical and and he needs to be every time he shows love or compassion for another he is made to suffer for it and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere cormac mccarthy 's prose style is challenging at first but i soon grew accustomed to it his long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the border region to vivid life
all the pretty horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world his personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his west texas upbringing his lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest his journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness moral dilemnas and cruel lessons about human nature and survival the best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by mccarthy his style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags punctuation and quotation marks this book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering
when i read this book i was completely impressed with the author 's power to draw you into the scene of the story i mean i was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses and i 've never seen them in real life this book is very and the imagery is powerful and moving the main character cole is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed a life that is no more he wants beauty in the world all he finds is pain and sorrow and maybe that is the way it is for all of us we want what he wants but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen if only that could happen it can not this is one of the most powerful themes in the book we are all chasing a life that in many ways can not exist in this world
this the first book in mccarthy 's reputation making border trilogy is what every novel should be a good story told well the book follows the adventures of a young boy as he travels with his best friend to mexico mexico in this novel is an ambiguous place and seems to be the last bastion at least in the boys ' minds of a way of life that problebly never existed the thing that breaks with other such narritives is that mccarthy does not write in stone why the boys decide to leave their country there is no hidden treasure one of the boys hear about or some crime they are tring to escape they just go and you as a reader i promise will follow with them even when the going gets tough and all the cormac fans know that this writer 's tough is a whole different monster than the standard breed to be found in most books this may not be his best book but that is like saying portrait is not joyce 's best mccarthy is a writer who will be remembered as someone who contributed something genuine to american letters a must for any fan of literature or the western in general
page 141 punctuation is as the author intended '' they 'd ride at night up along the western mesa two hours from the ranch and sometimes he 'd build a fire and they could see the gaslights at the hacienda gates far below them floating in a pool of black and sometimes the lights seemed to move as if the world down there turned on some other center and they saw stars fall to earth by the hundreds and she told him stories of her father 's family and of mexico going back they 'd walk the horses into the lake and the horses would stand and drink with the water at their chests and the stars in the lake bobbed and tilted where they drank and if it rained in the mountains the air would be close and the night more warm and one night he left her and rode down along the edge of the lake through the sedge and willow and slid from the horses back and pulled off his boots and his clothes and walked out into the lake where the moon slid away before him and ducks gabbled out there in the dark the water was black and warm and he turned in the lake and spread his arms in the water and the water was so dark and so silky and he watched across the still black surface to where she stood on the shore with the horse and he watched where she stepped from her pooled clothing so pale so pale like a chrysalis emerging and walked into the water she paused midway to look back standing there trembling in the water and not from the cold for there was none do not speak to her do not call when she reached him he held out his hand amd she took it she was so pale in the lake she seemed to be burning like foxfire in a darkened wood that burned cold like the moon that burned cold her black hair floating on the water about her falling and floating on the water she put her other arm about his shoulder and looked toward the moon in the west do not speak to her do not call and then she turned her face up to him sweeter for the larceny of time and flesh sweeter for the betrayal nesting cranes that stood singlefooted among the cane on the south shore had pulled their slender beaks from their wingpits to watch me quieres she said yes he said he said her name god yes he said
i was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment first off it 's rare for such a new book it was only published 14 years ago to be a school assignment well at my school it is i suppose that says something for this book it 's the easiest read but not bad rather boring in places it leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which i did n't like so much and i definably found the end rather rushed all in all not my favorite book but a good book in general
this book not only provides all the tools for a and based curriculum but it is also quite informative on it 's own and provides answers to many of the questions posed in other classes on a daily basis
author don soderquist 's retired vice chairman and coo writes passionately about the company its founder the late sam walton and its corporate culture once dubbed 'keeper of the culture ' he is not here to write a balanced objective corporate biography instead his admiration and respect for walton and shine from every line he examines the company 's workings from its humble beginnings to its rapid phenomenal expansion soderquist describes 's commitment to its customers and employees and describes its zeal he details its use of new technology to revolutionize internal systems these insights from the inside are very interesting but perhaps because the author was in the highest ranks of the company 's leadership the tone is so that it has the taste of public relations however if you seek immersion in this distinctive corporate culture and want to emulate the principles that worked for it we stand beside the big glass doors and welcome you to do you need a shopping cart
reading this book you get to know a humble man who pursues excellence in everything he does don soderquist would never say so but he is a great american and a role model for any young businessman and is proof that the strong american work ethic is really what makes our corporations so successful not the 'exploitation ' schtick that the demented newscasters constantly try to peddle
for me this book was n't primarily about it was about a man who took his principles to work with him and became incredibly significant in a world severly lacking in principle driven living it shines as a beacon here 's an example the closest competitor prices a product at 19.95 prices it at 14.86 why does n't raise their price to 17.95 beating the competition but earning 3 more on every unit answer because believes it holds a fair profit margin at 14.86 and wants the customer to have the lowest possible price page 94 that 's principle driven marketing i learned about the ten foot rule when a associate comes within ten feet of a customer he or she is to look up look the customer in the eye and speak to the customer if the customer asks where something is the associate does not tell the customer but takes the customer to the product page 91 that 's principle driven customer service the development of corporate culture as a combination of shared vision shared values shared purposes and shared expectations was helpful to me page 25 it was interesting to see how the corporate culture was promoted in i believe i can apply these principles in my life so this book really speaks to me forget about your of good or bad and harvest a gold mine of life principles from these pages i would use this as required reading in a college leadership class george goolde
is simultaneously admired feared loved and hated depending on from which perspective one looks at this giant retailer in this book the author 's view is that of an insider one who is passionately involved with the company 's growth for over two decades and who has lived by the core principles and beliefs of the company and finally reaching the position of coo and this book is not a business story of or a biographical outline of its founder however background knowledge of the world 's biggest company will help in understanding the basic principles that helped it reach the current position rapidly with a clear vision and determination frankly my admiration for has substantially increased after reading this book this is not because i am in complete agreement with what can perhaps be termed as view for the author the difference lies in the listing of the 12 core principles on which the company has been built and continues to grow rapidly even after reaching the magic figure of world 1. in terms of its global sourcing strategy procures aggressively from low cost locations especially china this has resulted in reduced prices and abundant supply of merchandise in america this practice is often accused as taking away of jobs from america and instead creating sweat shops in china the book challenges these allegations and explains the global supply chain strategies that need to be emulated by any multinational what i found more interesting about the book is that about certain assumptions that we may make about business strategy for example in simple economic terms price elasticity of demand means lower prices would ensure higher sales for most merchandise however is driven by customer satisfaction and the commitment to putting an extra dollar into the average american consumer 's pocket as the drivers and enablers that increase sales price reduction is the effect and not the bait the incident where a lady customer is given a free frying pan by the manager of a store just based on her declaration that she had lost the one she bought in the parking lot while taking it home is a good example of how much the employees are driven primarily by customer satisfaction and not just by sales targets learning from competitors is another great trait that has been well explained not only excels in customer service within its stores its truck drivers for example have helped many people who needed help on the roads especially women struck with vehicle breakdowns during late evening hours what more can customers expect no wonder they keep coming back again and again to what is now and will remain the planet 's biggest company as long as it continues to pursue its 12 core principles in action and in spirit
outstanding book ! very challenging and encouraging to read describes the man '' who had a clear purpose and vision was able to focus on it and communicate and motivate his team around him in achieving success
this review is an adaptation of my review published in personnel psychology winter 2004 issue as one of the pioneers in the corporate social responsibility csr movement hollender is evangelical about promoting the implementation of csr in all of its forms '' i 'm not sure i know what he means by that as he acknowledges it 's in the mind of the beholder '' because there 's no firm consensus '' about what csr means i certainly ca n't criticize him for not pinning down the concept professor ronald sims 2003 in his own book on the subject for instance has offered five different definitions i think hollender equates csr with the idea of a line of responsibility and accountability for fulfilling what he thinks should be the financial social and environmental obligations of a corporation margaret mead once said in effect that social change always starts and can only start with a small group of people the small group identified in the book as pioneers in the csr movement include small business entrepreneurs like ben cohen and jerry greenfield of ben and jerry 's ice cream socially responsible investment funds like the calvert social investment fund and a host of advocacy groups or organizations ngos like the activist group greenpeace and the more reserved businesses for social responsibility bsr that was conceived as sort of an alternative chamber of commerce the book gives an interesting account of the different ways in which these pioneers promote csr among big corporations one way for instance is and educative in trying to bring big business no matter how socially irresponsible to the table and then move the table '' for example bsr works closely with big companies to promote a set of best practices that hopefully will not only further the csr progress of those companies but also entice other companies not to be left behind another way is confrontational involving pressure tactics and sometimes law suits greenpeace for example gradually succeeded in pressuring royal dutch shell to choose a more environmentally responsible way to dispose of an obsolete oil storage tanker and loading platform in the north sea as you can well imagine the notion of csr is controversial and fraught with issues the authors clearly know that and for the most part deal with the issues relatively well in my opinion i 'll mention and discuss a few of the issues perhaps the biggest issue is over what should be the legitimate purpose of business hollender understandably totally rejects what he considers to be the hysterical '' opinion of conservative economist milton friedman that csr is fundamentally subversive '' and that the only legitimate responsibility of business is to make an honorable profit to hollender csr in all of its forms '' is the legitimate purpose thus a corporation that seeks to ameliorate public problems not of its own making is a more socially responsible company he cites coca cola as an example of a company persuaded by activists to modify its operations in ways to further the prevention and treatment of aids among its employees and those of its bottlers and suppliers three related issues are over who should be the public corporation 's legitimate stakeholders for what should it be held accountable and over what period of time to people in friedman 's camp the issues are shareholders are the only stakeholders the corporation is only accountable for maximizing their wealth and doing so through legal means and time is marked in quarterly returns this view is basically that the conventional bottom line is the only one that must matter to people like hollender the issues are also absolutely everyone and everything including the environment along the company 's long value chain from initial product resources to product disposal are the company 's stakeholders the company must be held accountable through full and transparent cost accounting to every one of those stakeholder interests and time is marked in the long run the conventional bottom line is thus immensely modified quantitatively and qualitatively i found the authors a bit lax in relying on several of their sources about one important matter bearing on those three issues the sources were quoted as claiming that boards of directors have a statutory obligation to maximize shareholder wealth in the short term i questioned that claim and one of hollender 's spokespersons acknowledged that it was a mistaken claim but this nevertheless does n't negate the immense pressure ceo 's are under to hit the numbers each quarter this pressure comes primarily from institutional investors who might as well be surrogates for a statute it takes a morally courageous ceo and a sustainable company to resist that kind of pressure in an article featuring hollender and bill george the recently retired ceo of medtronic the latter commented that he would say at every annual shareholder meeting that the company was not in the business of maximizing shareholder value '' and he believed he got away with that because the results were so good '' kelly 2004 another related issue is over how much there should be of a firm 's csr performance hollender proposes full transparency '' yet acknowledges that it can make the company squirm as his did over risking the possibility that full disclosure may end up making the company legally liable for a product shortcoming that might not otherwise ever be known he agonized for example that while one of his products was more natural ' than that of any of his competitors he was sure some of his customers at least presumed that his product was a bit better than it actually was '' not being a fanatically unrealistic csr advocate he decided to put a product section '' on his company 's web site instead of putting a disclaimer on the product 's packaging it 's a compromise yes but far more responsible than the values held and practiced by a baby food maker i remember as once having been charged with diluting its product another related issue is whether to take a public company private to escape wall street analysts and requirements more public companies are apparently going private and hollender himself is a case in point he took his firm private and that is what it still is today he points to the private outfitter patagonia as being able to take socially responsible actions much more easily than if it were traded on wall street yet another issue addressed and the last one of theirs i 'll mention is over whether a small socially responsible company should sell out '' to a larger corporation an advantage of doing so besides making a lot of money from the sale is the prospect of a responsible product being introduced to a much larger market but a disadvantage is that the seller risks seeing its values and practices diminished if not overturned altogether by the larger corporation the authors describe how ben and jerry initially felt they had negotiated a deal with unilever the buyer of their company to preserve the values the two pioneers held dear only to learn later of some actions taken by unilever incompatible with the values the authors claim that the csr movement has become a contagious trend '' i think that 's a bit exaggerated and the authors offer little hard data to back up their claim i think it is true that csr is becoming a more popular topic but i suspect and the authors acknowledge that it lends itself to tokenism or lip service for the sake of appearances or reputation that 's why incidentally i chose to mention the authors ' examples of shell and coke shell reportedly regards the north sea experience positively and claims there is now increasingly open and honest communication with the communities '' yet we read recently that its two top executives were forced to resign after lying for several years about the company 's oil reserves see timmons 2004 as for coke it 's frequently in the news for its cozy ties to strong arm dictators and rogue bottlers '' and for other alleged wrongdoing see klebnikov 2003 i could also have mentioned wrongdoing by some of the other companies the authors cite as making progress of one kind or another in their csr performance my point is that with so much harmful wrongdoing being committed by public corporations i would far prefer to see a relatively more restrained movement one that simply '' calls for public corporations to operate harmlessly '' achieving that standard would be a quantum leap from prevailing corporate behavior and i think corporations should direct their resources to taking that leap and not diverting them to the solving of problems not of their own making or to giving guilt gifts through philanthropy or to offering isolated token efforts the book is intended for a wide audience including business leaders employees and ngos i personally think it deserves to be on a best seller list and should be read by the ceo of every public corporation who has yet to decide where to position his or her company on the csr spectrum i also think all thoughtful citizens should read this book it matters a lot references kelly 2004 conversations with the masters

the ceo of seventh generation jeffrey hollender pens this book on responsible business i came across this book because seventh generation recently decided to sell their wares through target instead of most small businesses would love to be courted by the retailing giant but jeffrey hollender felt that target agreed more with seventh generation in this book jeffrey discusses his thoughts on running a responsible business the opening chapters were somewhat difficult to get through perhaps it just took several pages for me to get used to his prose the underlying message i felt was that having a socially responsible business is possible but will require a lot of work on everyone 's part everyone is so connected to each other now perhaps an environmental conscious entrepreneur decides to open a chain of organic restaurants and ensures that farmers are paid a fair price but what if the restaurant hires an exterminator that uses a toxin that ends up contaminating the soil for generations the idea is to have a business model that leaves things in the same condition as when the company began for example think of the credo of camping sites moreover the closed loop business model is more than just your business but includes your suppliers and customers specifically there are hidden costs to disposal of things like electronics and the ubiquitous clear plastic bags of course we every day consumers can throw them in the trash for someone else to deal with but someone does deal with our trash and there are some real costs the book gives a story of a putrid land in china where a lot of our electronic waste goes i have always loved companies that are transparent with their business models from a financial perspective transparency is about communicating to shareholders consumers and employees transparency is about being candid and introspective on dealings and reasoning for decisions there are a mixed bag of corporate stories mainly with ben jerry ice cream who is now part of unilever and seventh generation there is of course some mention of johnson and johnson 's tylenol case and also on electronic companies like hewlett packard and dell there is some applause for british petroleum for a decision to put no money to politics and shell who compromised with greenpeace on an issue in africa surprisingly this is a well thought out book that does n't get hysterical it 's honest transparent and i recommend it
i found the book to be uplifting it is nice to see this type of behavior being practiced we have entered a time in our existence where we have to start thinking of how we operate as an industrialized country chris ortiz author of overtime under poor leadershi
another leader of an iconic green company '' jeffrey hollender founder and ceo of seventh generation yes i use their laundry detergent exclusively discusses the challenges of running a business with high integrity and full disclosure in particular hollender recounts seventh generation 's stint as a publicly traded company and posits that public ownership inevitably leads to an erosion of core values by the pressures of the markets he cites also the example of ben and jerry 's by unilever i personally believe that positive social change can be wrought through the public securities markets and that values driven investing is the most significant tool available i appreciate what matters most as a cautionary tale keeping me alert to some of the perils of my chosen approach socially responsible investing as a vehicle for change i had the privilege of hearing jeffrey hollender speak at a working assets brown bag lunch lecture he is a forceful presence and very inspiring in his forthrightness in answering questions probing the gray areas that an ethical company must struggle with a recent addition to my review the resources section at the back of the book is very well researched and thorough it would be worth buying the book merely for that appendix
as a professor management who is interested in corporations acting more responsibly i have just begun to use this book in my senior strategic management course hollender is a thoughtful and insightful proponent of socially responsible business each chapter covers a specific characteristics of srb accountability transparency sustainability he recognizes that running a company using these principles is not easy but definitely worth it he covers most of the pioneers in the field roddick cohen anderson chouinard and their struggles to live their corporate lives in a responsbile way i highly recommend it dale fitzgibbon
this is an insider 's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility author and corporate survivor jeffrey hollender who wrote this with scribe stephen fenichell clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies such as ben jerry 's and the body shop he covers the informal history of the corporate social responsibility csr movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible his presentation is heartfelt if short on rigorous logic he candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises the book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible but its yardstick is not clear for example it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children perhaps starvation the book explores both the value of the corporate social responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions we recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business
noam chomsky 's critical analysis of hegemony is on point he uncovers the government 's recidivism one particular case was president reagan 's terror campaign in nicaragua the excuse was that communism was beckoning at our doorstep nicaragua had become the second cuba in the eyes of the right but what really transpired was reagan 's attempt to overthrow the sandinistas with trained contras when congress became concerned over this injustice for financial reasons of course the reagan administration began selling weapons to iran further financing their terrorist war in latin america reagan in the 1980 's wanted regime change in latin america and in 2006 history repeats its self since george bush is continuing reaganite policy in the middle east the tactics bush is currently using might be construed as different but the results are still the same these campaigns are n't much different than george washington 's campaign to eviscerate the iroquois which chomsky briefly alludes to in the book but for more information on the subject i strongly recommend reading the american indian wars '' by john tebbel and keith jennison howard zinn 's book a peoples history of the united states '' also covers this subject chomsky delineates about the 1961 campaign called operation mongoose '' operation mongoose was the centerpiece of american policy toward cuba from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 cuban missiles crisis '' this was a result of the failed bay of pigs invasion operation mongoose also known as the cuban project is the general name for cia covert operations and plans from to destabilize and overthrow the communist government in cuba '' quoted from wikipedia chomsky covers many subjects such as the conflict which the sends more financial and military aid to israel than all other countries combined iraq is also a humongous issue that chomsky successfully tackles since world war ii the government has participated in more than fifty wars and to this very day is continuing with their plans of hegemony in the middle east latin america and other countries abroad this is all transpiring either without the knowledge or consent of american citizens it is estimated that the bush administration has spent more than 300 billion in iraq and afghanistan these are disheveling developments considering the congressional budget office estimates that another 450 billion will be needed in the next ten years moreover the nuclear weapons program is n't included in the defense budget its part of the energy budget and intelligence gathering is in the black box budget program it is estimated by 2008 that the will have 14 submarines in the pacific armed with 336 trident 2 ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads and in spite of this debauchery former defense secretary donald rumsfeld said we 're trying to figure out how you conduct a war against something other than a and how you conduct a war in countries that you are not at war with '' this is nonsensical hegemony in motion the bottom line is the are planning to wage a war campaign against the entire world just ponder on this for a moment half of the united states ' aircraft carrier fleet occupies the pacific ocean plus the has over military bases worldwide knowing that this is the case one must take a step back and become a little more circumspect when gazing at bush 's panorama and inquire about the issues of medicare education food stamps and veterans insurance simply because the elites are also waging a war campaign against the american people the world is involved in a grave war for its survival against an elite system set up to enslave many and genocide the rest this book is a comprehensive history of hegemony gone tumultuously awry from george washington to george bush this book compiles 230 years of imperialism in the continental united states and the whole entire world moreover i would like to point out to all the reactionaries who 'll give my review a bad rating that this is n't about racism or religion it 's about the elites ' mad proclivities for empire and if you do n't wake up soon and see it for what it really is then our world will not survive wake up ! you reactionaries will not be apart of the new world order ruling class because you 're enslaved by it already as a matter of fact we are all slaves to this system of world government and in this system some of us will remain thralls and the rest are expendable remember was an inside job the government committed several heinous acts on that day just so we 'd rescind our constitutional freedoms chomsky has stated that he does n't believe that was an inside job and i have to say that i totally disagree with his assessment on the matter but i still think hegemony or survival is an essential read that we must all look at
provides overwhelmingly truthful information about america and the rest of the world it is a must read '' in order to understand all of the events taking place today
i doubt this book would have garnered so much attention had not hugo chavez waived it front of the un assembly decrying us imperial ambitions the book quickly soared to the top of most bestselling lists and briefly topped amazon book sales i well imagine noam chomsky had to crack a smile as it turns out that people do take notice when someone questions american authority and this is what this book is all about chomsky rides roughshot over and early century american history in making his case for its long held imperial ambitions he traces the ideological origins to wilson but he easily could have gone back to mckinley and roosevelt the first for plunging the us into the war and the latter for building a military juggernaut that would eventually save the day in wwi chomsky could have even gone back to james polk who similarly raised an unnecessary panic and plunged the us into the mexican war which turned out to be nothing more than a huge land grab virtually doubling the size of the us back in 1848. a book well worth reading is bernard de voto 's 1846 year of decision in many ways chomsky echoes de voto in his attack on american imperial ambitions he brings the scenarios up do date by focusing on america 's new role as hegemon since the end of wwii after its major rivals were either crushed or severely weakened rather than seek compromise the us relished its new role in shaping the world for a variety of reasons ostensibly keeping open a economic free market that favored its corporate interests no president escapes chomsky 's vitriolic attack including carter who refused to provide badly needed relief following a devastating hurricane in the caribbean because the island countries would n't refuse to renounce grenada which had the audacity to pursue a line in its new government later reagan would crush the small nation to show the american iron hand in the region which extended back to the war but the two presidents who chomsky most takes to task are clinton and bush for using preventive war in new and audacious ways that have severely comprised the role of the un as an international arbitrator chomsky attacks clinton on the kosovo war and strenuously challenges the bush white house position of just wars '' in afghanistan and iraq the book takes events up to 2004 providing a lot of valuable background information and illustrating the ideological origins of the current war on terror '' he makes a direct link between the bush ii administration and the i administration both in terms of language and actions but points out that while the first set of wars were largely subversive the current ones are blatantly aggressive and defy all international laws much less ethics you can take chomsky 's aggressive stance anyway you want but the book is heavily footnoted and the facts he presents largely hold up it is nice to see that the mainstream media is finally taking note and challenging the presidential administration after giving him what amounted to a free pass '' in his first term
after accurately addressing the current state of affairs in the united states government which can be called by many names chomsky uses polyarchy he radically reframes the last several decades of history in impressive detail and his work is to be commended my major criticism is that he gave far too little attention to the idea of polyarchy and the problems it attempts to address such an issue bitterly divided the founders but is far older than the united states plato dwelled on it in the republic '' he saw a democracy as nothing but a wreckless mob and that they must be ruled like children by guardians '' who live apart from the masses and consider the good of the people more important than their own of course such guardians are very rare for every marcus aurelius or diocletian there are half a dozen nero 's and caligula 's although bush is particularly odious his policy is merely at the extreme of a narrow spectrum as chomsky acknowledges so a system run by an elite will naturally reflect the interests of the elite and not of those whom they govern chomsky makes that very clear and that is one of work 's best messages but what to replace it lenin would have us believe that even a cook should be able to run a country but i doubt most people would agree jefferson also trusted the people but was he too idealistic what should replace this corrupt polyarchy although chomsky offers no solution it is still an important and informative work
this is the most lucid convincing and rightfully scathing interpretation of american foreign policy i 've ever read absolutely brilliant
i was one of apparently many who went to the amazon website to look for chomsky 's book once chavez recommended it i am familiar with chomsky 's reputation as a prolific writer of books on politics i 've tried to plow through some of his works on linguistics not easy although the sense one gets as a is that he is onto something original in those works i 'm glad he has shifted focus to politics he looks at facts pure and simple he as are many other americans is rightfully disgusted with the idiocy wanton destructiveness frightening arrogance and brazen dishonesty of the policies and actions of the current bush administration as he points out repeatedly however in hegemony american foreign policy has generally followed a similar although certainly less destructive path in most earlier administrations his comments on actions by the clinton administration in the balkans in particular in kosovo are enlightening underlying his exposition and analysis of the facts is of course his recurring thesis that americans are deluged by propaganda and lies initiated by the government which are then willingly distributed by most and unquestionably by the the most seen or read media outlets he is right on the mark it takes very little effort in the current world to find original sources on most subjects so finding the facts related to almost any topic or allegation is a few mouse clicks away the problem in regard to the pursuit and dissemination of the truth however is that so few people make the effort ! in any case since this is my first reading i have seen the documentary on manufacturing dissent exposure to chomsky 's political analysis i must say that hugo chavez made an excellent selection at least this shows he reads unlike george bush
that 's how the rest of the world views him i agree i first began reading chomsky back in the early and plan to pick this book up this afternoon i am giving it a 5 star rating ahead of time to counter the one star ratings given it by the rightwingers who will never actually read it and who simply attack whatever they are told to attack by the likes of rush limbaugh
noam chomsky is one of the most noteworthy and influential intellectuals of modern times whether you like him or not in my opinion everyone should read his books in order to get a general yet very insightful view of current political affairs and their historical and philosophical backgrounds his unflinching motivation to unearth the truths behind many political events bold character and extraordinary ability to see and make sensible connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena is absolutely outstanding this book is a product of era but contains a lot of information in regards to usa 's preceding quests for global dominance too on page 2 he mentions a very common trait of humans which one can not help but accept a hypothetical extraterrestrial observer might well conclude that humans have demonstrated that capacity throughout their history dramatically in the past few hundred years with an assault on the environment that sustains life on the diversity of more complex organisms and with cold and calculated savagery on each other as well '' there is a very conspicuous fact that the leaders of the usa would not understand in many ways which is mentioned on page 4 as follows there may still be two superpowers on the planet the united states and world public opinion the united states '' here meaning state power not the public or even elite opinion '' when i was a little boy in the 1980 's i was hearing the us military operations direct or indirect in central america but could not figure out what was happening exactly in order to see the whole picture one should read this book and compare with the news published and aired in media channels in those days one would see that there is a stark difference between the aforementioned sources the author bases many of his ideas on john ikenberry 's very interesting comment which is a grand strategy that begins with a fundamental commitment to maintaining a unipolar world in which the united states has no peer competitor a condition that is to be permanent so that no state or coalition could ever challenge the us as global leader protector and enforcer '' on page 12 the author argues very successfully the question that many americans could not find a satisfactory answer in their minds they wonder why many countries which exhibited immense support and sympathy to the usa right after turned their support away from the usa during the iraqi war the book says the global wave of sympathy that engulfed the united states after has given way to a global wave of hatred of american arrogance and militarism and even in friendly countries the public regards bush as a greater threat to peace than saddam hussein '' chomsky describes the driving philosophy behind the reagan and bush administrations as the us reserved the right to act unilaterally when necessary including the unilateral use of military power to defend such vital interests as ensuring uninhibited access to key markets energy supplies and strategic resources '' he describes the motto of the trio as well above and beyond a defensive instinct and goes on to say officially declaring an even more extreme policy one aimed at permanent global hegemony by reliance on force where necessary '' another world leader nelson mandela who had immensely suffered from oppression and repression condemned tony blair for encouraging international chaos together with america by ignoring other nations and playing policeman of the world '' the usa made a series of severe mistakes where it forbade other nations on the same issues on page 26 it is mentioned as after often with questionable relation to terror the bush administration claimed and exercised the right to declare people us to be combatants ' and to imprison them without charge or access to lawyers or family until the white house determines that its on terror ' has been successfully concluded '' the author quotes the famous regime change '' phenomenon as regime change does not mean a regime that iraqis might prefer but one that the conqueror will impose calling it democratic '' this bring the question that how effective realistic and this artificial democracy would be in the hands of people who have absolutely no knowledge and experience on page 41 there are interesting statistics as to how some nations think of the usa and its current political ambitions the following chapters of the book has a great deal of historical examples in which the usa was in some way and to some extent involved politically militarily and economically such as the middle east central and south america and asia there are vivid examples about the ideas and presumptions mentioned in the first pages of the book one should read the book for further discussions there is an interesting fact stated on page 130 jack straw of uk released a report on saddam 's crimes in 2002 but it was drawn almost entirely from the period of firm us and uk support a fact which was grossly overlooked of course this does not mean that saddam was a fine leader he was in fact a vicious dictator with a perverted mind and excessive cruelty the usa invented the terms old europe '' and new europe '' describing the european countries and countries who gave direct support to usa 's iraqi operation respectively this discrimination caused some tension among european countries the details can be found in the book there is a noteworthy historical turning point in turkey mentioned on page 135 and onwards as in the end the turks proceeded to teach a lesson in democracy to the west parliament finally refused to allow us troops to be deployed fully in turkey '' and implicitly criticized as follows strong governments disregard their populations and accept the role assigned to them by the global ruler weak governments succumb to the will of 95 of their population '' the following chapters mention the relationships between the usa and countries in eastern europe and the middle east balkans turkey israel iran et the rest of the book presents very strong and useful advice to the us government as to how they can construct and sustain viable healthy peaceful and relations with other countries without repeating the old mistakes which were proven to be absolutely wrong and conducive to animosity and resentment there are very valuable lessons regarding how the entire world can benefit from mutually respectful administrations and how strong democratic societies can be built on solid grounds overall this book is very much recommended to those who would like to see and understand the current political phenomena which were not covered by some biased media
this book is not thick and it has just the right amount of detail to balance the events here we follow carrie white a bullied high school girl with a paranormal gift sheltered by her religiously sick mother the first sin was intercourse say it ! '' carrie receives an invitation from a popular boy to the prom and of course it is a cruel prank and carrie 's gift has the last laugh dark and demented but shows how king is in a league of his own august 11 200
king created a world where you believe in the possiblity of people like carrie white he looks at the situations from so many angles that you know everything there is to know and feel thankful for it its another book that i just could n't put down reading it was a rewarding experience also recommended are king 's collections of short stories like night shift
this is where the genius started his famous reputation and talent if had not been for his wife she saved the original manuscript we probably woud not have the 1976 classic or anything else king related everyone shoud give this start of king 's genius a look
stephen king 's first book is well written and he paints an image of high school that most will identify with peer pressure bullying interaction between very different social and economic classes the plot centers around a young girl carrie and her struggle to fit into high school due to her extremely religious mother due to the movie 's iconic images i 'm sure most people will know what 's going to happen before even picking up the book still it is an entertaining and worthwhile read my one complaint is that king writes in a journalistic fashion including interviews pages from other '' books to build the whole story about what happens to carrie the style which king borrows from bram stoker 's dracula according to his introduction for carrie detached me from the story it focused on povs from side characters that were n't interesting it also lessened the impact of some of the novel 's suprises and twists however the book is worth checking out and much shorter than king 's later and sometimes overbloated novels
carrie is one of my favorite king novels for it 's loosely based on his memory of two girls in his school who were picked on 'without mercy ' i first read this novel in high school where carrie white 's character was unfortunately present i recall girls who were emotionally and sometimes physically battered by classmates and was once badgered by a bully myself this book is also part of the early 'raw energy ' of stephen king as a writer before he was launched into legendary status as a popular horror novelist though there is n't a happy ending in 'carrie ' i 'm still able to sympathize with her character and see some justice in her wicked vengeance this novel will remain on my bookshelves safe from any future garage sales and often chrissy mcvay author of 'souls of the north wind
i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour races religions nationality and creed all women are equal in my eyes in this remarkable novel sk makes his unlikely but good has a good dose of and it is one of the best books i have ever read it is simply about a teenager from maine named carietta white carrie the beginning of the story we see who her mother margaret white takes advantage of her making her feel stupid and left in school carrie is always the black sheep '' she has not friends and she is always picked is very unusual and strange at least to most people especially the ones in the book story but i would say quite frankly that i did n't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at is her first big humiliation i am a guy i know not much about a period so please forgive my use of the term openly anyway back to the plot carrie soon realizes that she is starts to practice using her powers seems as though she had the powers since birth but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it so so far we see this a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end allow me it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of 's mother explains alot of things but she is still a bad mother but i still ca n't hate carries 's mother because most mothers are sort of protective over their children soon carrie gets her first friend feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom this date is tommy ross meanwhile one of the bad girls chris is unable to attend the she sets up a nasty revenge against me when i tell you chris is a very jealous girl and if she ca n't have something no one else can especially carrie so chris arranges a trap for carrie two buckets of pig blood she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie 's and tommy 's head while at the prom the plan eventually succeeds tommy is badly injured drenched in pig 's blood carrie is laughed at for the last runs out of the then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge she starts to close all the then turns on all the water sprinklers wetting everyone but with a combination of water and electricity from the appliances were electrocuted eventually a fire gets things start to burn ! she walks toward her home burning everything within a certain radius of her powers when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her telling her that she is the spawn of eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers ' heart beat killing her eventually this is the good part of the book while carrie is walking on the streets going i do n't know where she seens chris and chris 's boyfriend driving towards her to bounce her carrie uses her powers to diverge to car killing chris and her stupid boyfriend sue eventually catches up with does n't kill her because she realizes that it was n't sue 's falt but chris 's during the battle with her mother carrie was stabbed i forgot to mention it sorry so now talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just dies this is the sad part i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes or maybe not but this book is definitely good i recommend it with all my psychic '' powers enjoy review was written by nigel
i began this book with a healthy dose of skepticism on more than one occasion i 've been involved in consensus '' processes that were less than stellar as an employee a board member a community member and business owner in the hands of an unskilled or manipulative or misguided or worse downright deceitful facilitator a consensus process can leave you feeling like your pocket has been picked you know exactly what i mean when you finish the process '' and feel like you 've been hoodwinked into agreeing to something because you did n't fully understand the scope of the issue you are supposed to be dealing with people with important information about the issue were n't in the room a manager who is worried about his ox getting gored has set the whole thing up to share the blame '' for some problem he does n't know how to solve you could never get a word in edgewise after your first stated concern stamped you as not a team player '' and it was clear the boss was n't going to go along with the decision the group made anyway ! well the author not only educated me about what real consensus looks like i feel like i 've been inoculated against the toxic variety the book as mentioned in another review is lean and mean but there is plenty of substance to chew on including a useful comparison of different decision making methods along with their strengths and weaknesses a clear explanation of the considerable power of a consensus process not the least of which is accelerated implementation of a decision succinct guidelines on how to start a consensus meeting off on the right foot clear suggestions on how a consensus process can be organized specific strategies for dealing with people who engage in unproductive behavior you know them as obstructionists grandstanders and those who sit silently waiting to strike with critical comments just when it seems the group is making progress perhaps the greatest value i found in this book is that it will steer me away from making the same mistakes i have seen other decision facilitators make time and again like not paying attention to simple and obvious things such as laying down ground rules for how people will communicate as they work toward a consensus the author even puts words in your mouth by giving you language to use just for this and other such occasions you will encounter while leading or participating in a consensus process the information is so accessible and useful beyond the topic of consensus that i have no doubt that i will wear this book out in no time the pages are already and the spine is creased thankfully i have n't dropped it in the tub yet
for anyone convening a meeting this is the perfect book to read in preparation great reminders and insights on how to create a safe place for inquiry and creativity as well as thoughtful decisions i found tips on ways to prevent and intervene when challenges to consensus arise particularly useful i love how it is organized and it is the perfect size for 2 hour airplane trips
working in and with groups and at the same time making progress can be an incredibly complex experience this book though it demands a disciplined and thoughtful effort will make a profound difference by its use having seen the principles of this work in action groups are healthier and far more productive toward their charter members discover the patience to listen and the courage to contribute to others results that make choosing this path quite worthy
first compliments to dressler for successfully resisting the temptation to unnecessarily 'inflate ' the size of this book as a result consensus through conversation is digestible during a reasonable length plane flight what makes it worthwhile to read on your next plane trip is this unlike many authors who are intellectually sound but lack on the ground '' skills dressler is different he knows how to bring about sustainable improvement in organizational productivity even better he knows how to teach others to do the same that 's what this book does illustrates why real conversation is essential to affect lasting change and then takes us from ivory tower to ground level by producing a tool box of diagrams tips do 's don'ts and straight talk if every author packed this much value into 77 pages we would all spend more time improving our organizations than reading about it thanks for raising the bar larry
as a medical practice administrator i found the approach described in dressler 's book as practical and an approach i intend to use for a tough decision i am struggling with and wondering not just what 's the answer '' but how do we decide between a number of less than ideal choices with big impacts and are we exploring the full universe of options '' i am excited about implementing dressler 's approach i believe its clarity and inclusiveness will not only produce a high quality decision but will generate benefits well beyond the decision itself
there are going to be other reviewers who can provide more erudite reviews reviews better grounded in the study of cities or economic history i am nothing more than an average reader who enjoys first of all potential readers should be aware that this is an econonomic history it follows flows of goods and capital rather than following the lives and careers of the men and women of chicago i knew what to expect but for people looking for a more standard history of chicago this may make nature 's metropolis difficult to engage i really enjoyed reading the book it stretched my understanding of the economic growth of cities and raised issues that i had not considered about the role of the city nature not as opposed to nature the examination of elements that made chicago into both a city and the city was fascinating the chapters tracing grain lumber and meat as goods were clearly written and underscored the central theses i guess it goes without saying that nature 's metropolis is far from a light read but that does not make it less rewarding as someone who does not have a background in history i only longingly wished that the bibliography had been annotated to help support further reading
this is a very distinctive well researched and argued book about how chicago developed starting with a standard model of urban economics the von thunen model of central place the author quickly moves beyond it the distinctive contribution of his book is cronon 's emphasis on how the roots of chicago 's remarkable development lay in the soil '' of its surrounding hinterlands he carries this argument further by examining how the transportation and communication revolutions of the century the railroad and the telegraph created unique advanatages for chicago relative to other competitive metropolitan areas such as louis cincinnati milwaukee and finally how in turn new metropolitan areas such as kc omaha arose to steal aways chicago 's dominance as other reviewers have noted the book offers really fascinating detailed discussions and original research on for example the grain and lumber industries as well as capital flows in the midwestern us creatively using court records on corporate failures to track the flow of investments this books contains a rich lode of intellectual wealth and it is well worth the effort to mine it
if you prefer your history to be the story of human beings their struggles and their triumphs this book will disappoint cronon presents the history of chicago and the midwest as the history of commodities and trade it 's an interesting approach and he shows the global implications of many of his insights he correctly observes that much of what he demonstrates with chicago could also be shown with other cities as well some of his insights did n't strike me as being nearly as unexpected as he seems to think they are the interdependence on commodities wholesalers and their markets for example but most of his ideas are and supported ultimately this is not so much about chicago 's history as it is about using chicago and the west as a case study to show how cities grow and how city and country are
grain beef and lumber chicago became what it became not only because of its location on the great sytem but also because of these resources this book shows how much nature influences human efforts it has few personalities because the exploitation of the resources was inevitable this is a great book for a greater understanding of how nature drives humanity
as a professional educator it 's always great to review and reread the works of the great theorists such as piaget i consider him to be the father of educational psychology as well as a a great cognitive theorist

to call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the genius alex ross is not presented in chronological order but rather starts with the most popular characters superman batman and then moves on to other work such as justice league of america kingdom come alan moore etc alex ross is arguably the greatest visual artist of our time as far as i am concerned his work is up there with picasso da vinci and degas this book takes the reader in a journey of alex ross 's incredible work what ross and this book have in common are the incredible attention to detail and color the art presented in this book is so rich in color it is almost unreal the pictures carry unbelievable detail down to the pores on the faces of the superman and batman sculptures i have never seen such a visual fest in any other comic or book i guarantee you you will not be disappointed it does n't even matter whether you are a comic book fan or not ross 's modern day interpretation in the recreation of the art work from and comic book covers is so nostalgic and professional it makes you appreciate his talent even more this is one book not to miss the print quality is extremely high and pictures carry a ridiculous amount of detail and color especially if you are a superman or batman fan you are on for a treat as they are most prominently featured in this book this is one great book i have always been a huge alex ross fan but thanks to this book i now feel like i know him personally through his art presented in this book as well as the narration in the text that accompanies the pictures one last note get the hardcover if you can the art work on the sleeve is much better than the paperback cover and the art work on the front and back of the hard cover book is simply incredible

more an inside in ross ' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters beautiful boo
this book will astonish you even before you open it the jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of dc superman and batman and below the jacket you 'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every dc superhero battling versus their respective villains with an introduction from m night shyamalan the book presents alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him even though he affirms this did n't happen take a look at her mom 's works and try to believe him he then presents the dc characters one by one the batman session has some pages dedicated to the joker only no other villains are shown the early drawings original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers posters or special editions analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what ross wants to project with his images i do n't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only you get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece the ideas scratched on a piece of paper the drawings and possible posing and then the final image there are pictures i has never seen until i got this book when i first saw them my fisrt thought was i need to frame these ' which came up as a bad idea as i would have had to frame the entire book the abandoned ideas for of villainy ' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed his takes on mad magazine alan moore the animated style and world 's finest are also present then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'kingdom come ' from the early concepts and ideas passing through sketches until the realization of the project the possible prequel that never occurred kingdom ' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by ross are shown uncle sam is also analyzed near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were then we have this section called process ' in which we obviously get to see how alex works using the book 's cover as example the final part of the book is a very nice bonus a special story written by chip kidd and alex ross created exclusively for this book indeed a great piece of collection this book is a must for comic book fans the hard cover presentation the paper in which it is printed and the bonus stuff are worth the price to pay
this book shows there could be millions of minorities living in a stagnant way of life where they 're not able to achieve or dream of the so called american dream i loved this book i felt this book this book is important and it should be read by anybody that cares for those living a life that 's unimaginable to many of us through everything lafayette and pharaoh were still children i felt a lot of hope in this book through it all there was some kind of peace this is my favorite book from alex i 've read his other book the other side of the river and there are no children here is his absolute best
one of the best books that i read this year there are no children here '' is about two brothers try to fit into there world these two brothers are deciding who they are the two brothers are lafeyette and his younger brother pharoah this book takes place in the chicago projects at the henry horner homes everyday these boys only see violence they see drugs gangs and murder lafeyette and pharoah mother lajoe talks to a report who is a writer for magazines the report ask lajoe can i talk to the children here '' she says there no children here '' as lafeyette and pharoah grow up they only have a mom so lafeyette is a father figure to his younger brother pharoah as lafeyette goes to his teen years he starts to hang with gang members and goes to jail a few times is lafeyette a good father figure for is brother pharoah the younger brother is very dedicated young man he will always put a 100 in no matter what he will never give up what will happen to these two brother while grow up in the chicago projects will they hang with gangs and do drugs or will they try to make it out of the projects and be someone while read this book you feel like you are in the story you feel like you are the report write everything you could really see this really happen i enjoy this book because it talks about the real world that we do not see ever day
there are no children here this book is about two young boys trying to get passed the ghetto and harsh life the two boys are lafayette and pharaoh they live in the henry horner projects they are trying to get passed the everyday violence hatred and crimes that go down in the projects they would do anything to have what other people have like a nice clean home some good clothes a car for the family and a good education these boys do n't have these things along with several other children living in the ghetto they struggle so much to succeed in life in the book they go through a lot of bad times and hardly any good ones they support each other and they wo n't let each other fail without trying at first it is not often that they have positive attitudes most of what they do and think is negative their behavior comes form their surroundings maybe if their surroundings were a little more decent they would turn out better in live i would recommend this book to people who have what these children do n't so they can realize that they should n't take things for granted i would give there are no children here '' four stars out of five
as referenced in the preface according to the children 's defense fund one in every three children lives in poverty in the city of a remarkably higher rate than the rest of the country alex kotlowitz 's national bestseller there are no children here '' depicts the poignant and powerful story of two brothers lafeyette and pharoah growing up in one of chicago 's most notorious public housing projects the henry horner homes although this is a story of hardship and tragedy it is also a story of courage hope and love kotlowitz chronicles the lives of pharoah and lafeyette as they confront racism and violence in their own community this extraordinary story exposes the fact that two parallel worlds still persist in this county and how america continues to be defined by poverty and violence and is maintained by institutionalized racism and social inequalities this story is at times difficult to read because for lafeyette and pharoah violence is a part of their daily lives they witness death shootings drugs the incarceration of their older brother their mother 's struggle to provide for her family and the influence of gangs at an early certainly more hardship and tragedy than many adults will face in a lifetime however they confront these realities with courage and profound insight beyond their years the only negative aspect of the book is that kotlowitz does not chronicle the educational experience of both boys adequately we are given a brief glimpse into the quality of education that pharoah receives and his academic hardships and successes however we are left with little to no information about lafeyette 's experience in school education is fundamental to the future success of children in poor urban communities and it would have enhanced the story to have more insight into the quality of education that the two brothers received in order to gain a more comprehensive perspective of the inequities that exist in low income urban communities when kotlowitz first proposed writing a book about the lives of lafeyette and pharoah to chronicle the experiences of children growing up in urban poverty their mother lajoe remarked but you know there are no children here they 've seen too much to be children '' 1 despite their struggle to survive we are reminded that they still are children tying to determine who they are and what their place is in the world around them
my god who has no feeling for these very unfortunate people are heartless society flushes their poor and disadvantaged people away in the gutter the gap between the poor and wealthy is increasing all the time and something has to give great book and should be required reading for high school seniors
i would highly recommend this book to anyone the author provides insight into the lives of two inner city youth it makes you question our society and what we can do to help individuals who live in poverty poverty is not a choice but rather a sad reality that effects far too many of america 's youth please read this book ! it will change the way you think
to hardcore conservatives who believe that the plight of the poor is no one 's fault but their own i say read this book to hardcore liberals who believe the poor are oppressed by society and not responsible for their situation i say read this book there are no children here '' shows that life is more complicated than either extreme the lives of the people in this book are governed by complex interactions of both personal choices and unavoidable bad luck the author sympathetically examines the terrible hardships his subjects were born into but never shies away from showing how their situation is perpetuated by the harmful behavior and relationships they choose to pursue whatever your ideology is going in you will not look at poverty the same way after reading this book
i think that the 'reader 's ' comments below about thomas sowell were helpful and i just wanted to add one more thing most of the negative reviews about this book are people who are angry at phaorah and lafayett 's mother lajoe they claim that lajoe is stealing from the government and blah blah blah the problem is that lajoe 's story is not the authorial intent of the book the subtitle of the book clearly states this the story of two boys growing up in the other america '' not the story of lajoe raising kids in the other america '' when reading this book bear in mind that the book is looking at the two main characters who are born into a situation that they can not help is it their fault that their parents never got married or that they get government money etc hardly ! people who get angry at the lajoe and consequently miss the point of this book are like people who would get upset if you were trying to describe an apple and they want to talk about a pear concentrate on the lives of the children in this story to see what the book is really trying to say having lived in two different boroughs and four different neighborhoods in new york city has opened my eyes even wider to 'the other america ' that so much of the rest of america could n't care less about kotlowitz 's book is a good start to understanding this oft forgotten group of people
this book takes you through so many different emotions kotlowitz does an amazing job weaving this documentary novel together it opens the eyes of suburban america this book inspired me to teach in the a for anyone going into teaching public service anyone with an interest in the social fabric of disadvantaged america
what a joy it was to read this book and another of fischer 's books paul revere 's ride written in narrative storytelling fashion the book moves briskly but with urgency i will save the long reviews for the top 500 writers here at amazon but i found this book to be extremely satisfying what 's more not only does fischer illuminate washington 's determination to keep the idea of liberty alive he also writes about the tremendous help given the continental army by locals who continued to harass the british throughout the winter as british foraging parties searched for food for themselves and their horses
david hackett fisher 's washington 's crossing '' is a wonderfully written and research history of this seminal event in american history i was admittedly hesitant to read this work pulitzer prize and all as i felt the topic a bit narrow for my tastes and it perhaps a bit too much like a high school history lesson luckily i was very mistaken perhaps the author put it best there is an old american folk tale about george washington and the crossing of the delaware it tells us that the new american republics nearly failed in the winter of 1776 that george washington crossed the delaware on christmas night and that his victory at trenton revived the revolution all of this story is true but that in not the whole truth there was more to it '' the more to it '' is captured in the pages of the book and followed by footnotes and various appendices that accound for 168 pages many of which are well worth reading within of themselves fisher accomplished so much in this volume that the lavish praise many have written is richly deserved his ability to put into context a very rough 1776 with the crossing and ensueing battles was simply superb fischer and james mcpherson are editors of this series published by the oxford university press pivotal moments in american history james mcpherson a wonderfully accomplished historian and contribtor to another series by the same publisher the oxford history of the united states with battle cry of freedom will most assuredly oversee works of very high caliber i look forward to reading many more of them with james patterson at the top of my list with his contribution to this series on brown the board of education lastly i would add that my interest in history rarely includes an appetite for military history that said fischer does a great job in covering a largely military operation while keeping the interest of students of history who might not otherwise be inclined for the level of research and written detail
i eyed washington 's crossing for a long time before finally purchasing it meanwhile in the past couple of years i read ellis ' his excellency george washington '' and mccullough 's john adams '' and 1776 '' although i am by no means finished reading about the period and its individuals i have gotten a wonderful education in the lives and times of this era all of these books complement each other and washington 's crossing is the crowning piece that ties much of it together washington 's crossing is very and pays homage to washington as a great man and leader revisionist and alternative views of the making of our nation do not have a place here instead the author focuses on the best ideals that made the united states great such as respect for individuals of all stations a willingness to listen to the views of others flexibility and perseverance in adversity and changing situations the placing of the good of the nation ahead of one 's advancement and glory and decency on the field of war as a historical record the book is outstanding and tells the story from both sides the british are not a faceless and evil enemy but a group of largely decent and capable people trying to do the right thing from their perspective we americans should regard ourselves as fortunate in having them as our mother country '' and the basis for our own institutions the various battles and maneuvers of the new york and new jersey campaigns are described in detail but not in a minute matter and the result is fascinating history many maps are included that will aid the reader in understanding the action the book contains many appendices that provide much added and incidental detail that the reader eager for more knowledge will enjoy washington 's crossing '' is a keeper for a lifetime and now sits on a bookshelf awaiting my return
as a veteran of both the united states army field artillery and militia national guard professor fischer 's story makes one proud to have served in the same army as george washington and those brave men who tramped through the snow and freezing rain
fantastic exciting true tale of one of the most well known legends in the history of this country only it 's not a legend fischer goes to great and convincing lengths immediately in the book to make this point clear i have no problem with revisionist history as long as it brings to light the uncovered or supressed details of what we hold sacred as historical truth this book is revisionist history in that fashion and it reinforces the facts behind the legend with his excellent reference list and his ability to place the reader at the site of the drama of the events this book is a believable and authentic narrative of what happened during this pivotal and desperate year in american history
i 'll start by saying that it took me only three days to read this book cover to cover i could n't put it down ! exciting narrative well researched and a must read for everyone
part of the oxford pivotal moments in american history series fischer 's work is a cultural history surrounding the events that washington 's revolutionary army participated in from march of 1776 to march of 1777 with the middle of the book focusing on the pivotal turning point of the unlikely capture of the hessian garrison in trenton new jersey on christmas of 1776 made famous by the painting featured on the cover of the book fischer 's book was published at nearly the same time as mccullough 's 1776 which covers nearly the indentical time period yet unlike mccullough 's focus on the narratives and characters of the of the dark days of the american cause in 1776 fischer 's work is a close examination of cultural trends and mores that developed and moved the american army unlike no other movement in the world at the time in short mccullough 's book would be best enjoyed by those looking for a level of the events of the day it is an excellent book that will be read for years and fischer is complementary of it but washington 's crossing is an look at why the american cause took the course it did and what precisely that means for us today it is most certainly not most importantly washington 's crossing does a wonderful job of the american cause to american readers while reintroducing the concepts of rare and unique combinations of leadership and service that actors such as washington knox monroe and down to the yeoman were in world history something new was happening along the banks of the delaware that december when it was most unlikely to
in my quest to increase my understanding and knowledge of the american revolution i came upon this book by fischer it was well recommended so i took a chance '' i hope all my future gambles '' in life turn out this good fischer takes the well known story of washington crossing the delaware one we all learned about in school and tears apart everything you thought you then rebuilds it into a thoroughly entertaining and fastinating series of historical events he writes a wonderfully easy to read a page turner he goes into depth without boring you to sleep or losing you in a myriad of facts and names as for the actual text i marvelled at the sheer luck that befell the continental army with the turn of the it 's no wonder they felt that divine providence '' was on their side i was taken by the diametrically opposing stratagies and methods of the two prominent washington and howe and was engrossed by the descriptions of battles and the diversity of the conditions the british hessian and american armies were living under the appendices are a treasure trove of information that should not be make sure you read them when you are finished the book i 'll never look at emmanuel leutze 's painting the way same again
i join the chorus of admirers of this wonderful history of the events leading up to and including the great battle the crossing was indeed a pivotal crucial moment in american history it is no stretch of the truth to enumerate this as one of the 10 most important moments in our entire history although washington deserves the credit for his extraordinary skill nerve and leadership fischer 's is an amazing feat of fascinating detail about the ordinary soldiers who overcame enormous obstacles to get to trenton much less to triumph over the shocked hessians and their valiant leader who bravely succumbed to mortal injury we cross the treacherous delaware with the intrepid americans trek with them across the snows hurrah with their surprise attack and follow them on to further victory historian or lay person this is a book you must read to learn of this little skirmish '' that eventually made america a world power fischer has done a masterful job we come away just that much prouder to be descendants of these at once ordinary and extraordinary americans
this is just a tremendous piece of work i 've read a lot of focused revolutionary war items and to say that some are readable '' is a gross overstatement this reads almost as well as a good novel it also does n't have too much about the ny campaigns or much beyond
especially young ones i have now been a vegetarian for five years and rarely use this book any more but it was great when i was first starting out lauren butts was sixteen when she published this book and the recipes are all geared towards kids in that age group both in simplicity and taste when i bought this book it was getting a lot of buzz because it had just been published by such a young author judging by the date of the last review i 'm guessing it has fallen off the radar i however would still recommend this book to any teenage vegetarian
though i am 23 older than the intended audience my mom bought me this book as a present i was thrilled with it lauren butts has created a fun and easy cookbook for anyone i love the layout of the cookbook it is divided into sections and i enjoyed her nutritional info in the front of the book maybe it will inspire more teens to go found this cookbook full of great meatless recipes i must warn strict vegetarians and vegans however that most recipes contain dairy products or eggs there is a great recipe for nathan 's blueberry breakfast cupcakes '' that is easy to make and tastes like store bought however when i tried to get my three year old neighbor to eat one he refused in horror other recipes that i have enjoyed making include apricot chimichangas thai tofu veggie burrito roll up veggie pitas tastes the same as wendy 's veggie pita layered nacho salad mock caesar salad in case you did n't know caesar salad dressing is typically made with chilled berry is a fabulous recipe i made last summer when berries were plentiful it is totally tasty and makes a great meal tasty flatbread pizza with artichoke hearts ! ! this pizza was so unbelievably tasty i have always been a bit wary of artichoke hearts they just look kind of disgusting you know but i was so shocked to discover their delicious taste ! ! veggie quesadillas were also fabulous spaghetti pie is indeed a great dish and i like to make it when serving it has been a hit with everyone so far tofu mcnuggets are the absolute bomb these recipes are only a fraction of the great ones in this book i would highly recommend it to parents of new young vegetarians or college students like myself who do n't have that much time to cook some have opined that this book is full of recipes that are fattening but i think most know that us vegetarians are a mostly lean lot and i can personally attest that the recipes are n't fattening thanks lauren for creating a great book it is indeed an oasis as far as veg cookbooks go its great to have a cookbook that is n't full of really long hard to find expensive ingredients
i personaly know the author of this wonderful book i went to a camp with her that helps for college credits she is very intelligent and i have tried the food in this book it tastes really good the book is well thought out easy to read and perfectly set up for any teenage vegitarian i gave a personal review before it was published so i do recomend this book to any teenager that is willing to cook
i must admit iv always been a clinton fan especially for the part he played in the north of ireland i thought the book was well written and gave an interesting account of the good and bad sides of the american political system the book gave a great incite into the man himself and what it takes to become president great read highly recommend
bill clinton writes a very interesting account of his life in an inviting conversational style his approach easily draws the reader into the events of his life i especially enjoyed the amount of time he spent discussing his childhood he expresses the pain and isolation that he felt very well he is a talented communicator and this comes through as he tells his story the words flowed one after another and i was easily captivated by the details this review actually refers to the audio cd unabridged version part however after 21 cd 's for part i alone i did become tired of all of the explanations and wished i got the abridged version overall it was a great book and i am going to also read part 2. it provides insight and apology for the actions of our he seems to have written it to make amends with those he offended
why did i decided to listen to an autobiography i still do n't know autobiography 's have never interested me before however bill clinton 's autobiography articulate and exceedingly detailed was the exception aghast by clinton 's extraordinary memory i found myself lured in by the minutia of his narrative a perfect account of every name date and place since he was a kid ! he has almost a photographic memory a prerequisite of any yale law graduate public opinion often casts presidents as idiots when in fact they are some of the brightest minds in our country to become a president takes a great deal of intellect wisdom charisma will power and luck marveled by bill clinton 's brain power i wished i was him bill clinton leaves the reader inspired by his biography motivating the reader to accomplish their own goals an upbeat former president clinton is still a leader and motivational speaker a must read for anyone who needs direction in their life
well written good book interesting to read his perspective on world events different from what i was seeing in the media
i read this book with some skepticism at first since the initial reviews from the pundits were lukewarm but i must admit it is a riveting account of late century american politics and what it takes to rise to the top clinton 's narration comes across in a natural easygoing style and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed this is a serious account by clinton about his strengths weaknesses and most importantly his capacity to forgive his enemies his early childhood experiences especially what he learnt from his grandfather seem to have made a major positive impact in his life this and how his folks were even though they poor southern folks from the era armed him with that teflon coating needed in politics clinton 's capacity to forgive is exceeded only by the public 's willingness to forgive him in his glaring personal weaknesses they recognized their own follies and in his ability to overcome they saw their inner hero clinton in many respects was a naked president this nakedness comes across even in the narration endearing readers to him and to see in his vulnerabilities an innocent and instant capacity for change a second or third reading if you have the ! brings out more of clinton 's emotional and political entrails some trends emerge for example clinton would dream big would start strong win rally again win big this time no doubt this comes from his personality to seek adventure and to relish the pleasure of an impossible comeback one of clinton 's stated dreams was to write a great book this book too has embarked on a similar journey it started with great fanfare bestseller fizzled in the ratings now beginning to rally the years pass i see even his ardent detractors mellowing is possible that this book will finish the journey will rally and win big in all seriousness this is an excellent read
the cd version of my life is the perfect companion for a long road trip several reviewers have observed that the 900 page book is too long but the abridged cd version cuts some of the detail and covers the major events of his life in six hours while listening to clinton 's smooth southern accent i felt like i was sitting on a porch in georgia listening to a fascinating person recount the highlights of his life and what he has learned from them highly recommended
i never appreciated this man while he was president or victim of a scandal from his own weakness ! yet after reading frkurt messick 's excellent review i gained valued insights into the inner life struggles of bill clinton after a few chapters into his years as governor of arkansas he solidly attributes his salvation to his wife and family i doubt that he can justly objectify his personal status when he endeavors to separate his constant external and internal struggles ! he places his personal struggles alongside the weakness of his brother roger at the feet of dysfunctional fathers as i came to the time of his becoming president the cd player kept me in the dark about monica molinski ! that part will wait till i can buy the book i am closer to becoming an admirer of his position in history as our bright and gifted president a good parent and an equally good partner for his brilliant teammate hillary clinton ! far more cheerfuly and gratefully retired chaplain fred w hood
when fernand braudel originally published this text in the sixties he became a pariah at the sorbonne in retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that banned in boston '' came to embody previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history braudel 's was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis it captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations sacrificing only the detail outside the themes even subsequent to a history of civilizations '' other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original and do n't be tempted to skip the soft '' introductory chapters with titles like the study of civilization involves all the social sciences '' and the continuity of civilizations '' these tee up the hard topics like the greatness and decline of islam '' there 's method in braudel 's approach and it takes patience braudel 's translator richard mayne had his job cut out for him the complex syntax is that of a french intellectual of the sixties and it is retained in mayne 's text but you become accustomed to it do n't look for maps or photographs in this penguin paperback the text alone is six hundred pages there 's only one other book in this space from dawn to decadence '' by jacques barzun in my view they are complementary
if you want a better understanding of how the world has come to be what it today is then this book is a good first step in so doing braudel was an influential french historian specializing in the mediterranean so his insights into the evolution of europe are more insightful than other regions he highlights but he is insightful throughout excellent book to read while you bask in the sun with your feet dancing in lake michigan on a tourist beach as i did maybe the atmosphere i had while reading made me enjoy it more nonetheless one should read this if they have any desire to
this book is extraordinary ! meant for french lycens in their last year before sitting for their bac exam it was a failure however looking at today 's situation of the west vis vis the islamic and other worlds it is a jewel among other things it explains the origin of today 's conflicting attitudes for example why the egyptians and other mediterranean peoples become in overwhelming majority moslems several centuries after the conquest by the arabs
this book is great since all the step by step instruction is accurate this book is for sap consultants who have little knowledge of concepts and would like become a expert the only thing that i saw lacking is for business explorer query options there are very few examples for business explorer but however i think if you play with the gui this problem is overcome easily this book is worth it ! !
as title suggests this book is step by step guide i think author has assumed you already have knowledge of sap bw concepts it walks you through steps on how to create infocubes load data and create queries and workbooks its extremely useful for people who are thinking to themseleves in bw area not meant for expereince bw people
secured packaging prompt i would do business with them again
in the introduction the authors tell us that the purpose of the book is to provide snapshots of daily life if you have ever been to italy you know that they have a different notion of what it means to live every visit that i have every made to italy there has been a general strike that has taken place the first time i visited italy this fact mystified me now i just know that this is what happens and i do n't let it bother me this book is a collection of short discussion on a variety of topics the topics covered are as follows 1. april fool 's day 2. at the table 3. attracting attention 4. bad luck day 5. il bar 6. le barzellette joke 7. basic expressions in italian 8. la befana 9. business 10. calcio soccer 11. calendar 12. calling cards 13. il campanilismo 14. il carnevale 15. celebrations and holidays 16. compliments appreciation and criticism 17. dating and marriage 18. driving in italy 19. education 20. expressions such as dio mio ! 21. eye contact in conversation 22. family and friends 23. il ferragosto 24. form of government and politics 25. gallantry 26. gestures 27. houses and housing 28. introductions 29. italian films 30. italy on wheels 31. the kitchen 32. the language 33. letters 34. made in italy 35. ma lei non sa chi sono io ! you do n't know who i am 36. il malocchio evil eye 37. m'arrangio 38. meals and mealtimes 39. monetary unit the lira this is now out of date 40. navigating a building 41. number usage in different situations 42. on stage in italy 43. opera 44. il palio 45. people 's names and name days 46. physical distance and contact 47. la piazza the center of daily life 48. politicians 49. professional and civil titles 50. pro loco 51. punctuality 52. la raccomandazione 53. religion 54. restaurants 55. lo sciopero strikes 56. shopping 57. signs 58. lo sport 59. telephones 60. the term american 61. tests 62. time of day 63. transportation 64. the two faces of italy 65. tu lei and voi 66. la vendemmia 67. visiting 68. waiting in line 69. ways of conveying information 70. we make love not war 71. the wines of italy 72. women 73. work 74. the world of youth the sections that speak of male and female interaction are very valuable for women traveling to italy alone italians are very expressive people they are much more demonstrative than americans this book covers that fact in great detail and does a nice job of getting the point across physical beauty is greatly prized in italy and this will result in more than a few pinches when you are a woman in italy unaccompanied overall i think this is useful little book to read before leaving for your first trip to italy it wo n't make a lot of sense before you arrive in italy however once you are there much of it will become clear
this slender volume reads fast a comprehensive study of italian culture is beyond the scope of this book the authors have arranged 74 brief points '' about daily life in italy alphabetically by subject so the reader does n't know what is coming next if you look at the sample pages available here you will get a sense of the leaps we begin with an explanation of the italian version of april fool 's day followed by four paragraphs on table manners and then we 're on to attracting attention '' and so on from the very way it 's organized we are clearly in the realm of entertainment although the information is accurate and certainly useful there is a dusting of vocabulary but it 's not a course in italian for travellers i found it a delightful and fascinating read
this book offers true informative facts about italy and the italian lifestyle in an easy to read format it 's a great read for anyone planning a trip to italy or for anyone simply interested in this magnificent country

i definitely would n't change these workbooks a and b for other advanced english grammar workbooks if you want to master grammar in order to top a toefl or tesl exam i really recommend it the examples are extremely easy to follow the only problem is that i prefer a system anyway my five stars go to betty azar 's grammar book

pranab chatterjee wisely cautions us to remember that there are ways of expressing nationalism that differ from the western models with examples from literature and history the author helps us explore the inner '' spiritual or cultural world of bengalis in colonial india a world they tried to keep safe and distinct from the outer '' world of politics the writing in places is a bit vague but the reading is worth the effort to remind us that wisdom does not begin and end in the west
even though montgomery did not intend anne of green gables to be a series she still captivates with her eager readers in anne of avonlea there are still quite a few differences anne has grown from a queer '' fiery young girl to a wiser calmer schoolteacher yes a schoolteacher also as we follow anne in this bildungsroman literature the romance between her and gilbert blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first and perhaps this is because anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude altogether my opinion of the book is that it was a good and i sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as anne of green gables
being a montgomery fan helps of course but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the anne of green gables which started it all the writing hold true to the author 's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series my wife and i have been reading these books for years and never tire of them again as with her first work you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time this particlar story starts where the last left off anne is sixteen and her adventure continues i for some reason find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly
red haired with a flaming temper the phenomenal anne shirley is back in her book ! marilla a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing anne up when she was an orphan has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins davy and dora keith anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes like making his sister dora walk the pig fence ! davy s idea of fun includes violence and humor v but only for himself the girls have to teach davy manners which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy anne s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world at school she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students especially paul irving this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen he brings her flowers and calls her sweet teacher her friendship with striking gilbert blythe for calling her hair carrots has grown but what is gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant has diana her bosom friend finally grown up i really enjoyed this book because it talks about anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever i simply couldn t put it down because after every page anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger my mom keeps telling me to go and do work but i can not stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written i like the others in this series you montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life ! referring to the special collectors editio
i love this story echo lodge was great it was about the last book where anne is in avonlea and a little girl very excellent book
this is just a wonderful sequel to anne of green gables it deals with anne 's life after returning to avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college seeing anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad it is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the avonlea village improvement society to which there is some resistance from the avonlea elders at first anne is still of course a kindred spirit but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures which was is just a touch sad but as henderson says all things must change for anyone who liked the first book this is sure to not disappoint
it never ends luckily ! ! ! i will never tire of anne 's wonderful lively imagination in this story anne is sixteen with lovely dark red hair gray twinkling eyes and only seven freckles ! anyways more happens in this story than a change in appearance anne becomes the avonlea schoolma'am and loves her students like crazy especially little paul irving who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher anne and marilla even adopt little twins who also win their love but when diana barry and anne are wandering down the lane one evening they stumble upon the lovely miss lavender she has the same imagination too ! well everything in this story is just as perfect as it 's prequel it 's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels in this case they 're both great
anne of avonlea was almost as good as the first anne book it is about anne 's life as a school teacher in avonlea marilla adopts two mischievous twins and rachel lynde moves in so life is never dull for anne at the school house or at green gables you could read it on its own but i recommend you read anne of green gables first
i read this book when i was 12 and loved it now i 'm 21 and recendly read it again and i liked it even more the plot is great the characters are alive and the writing is must for anyone that wants to laugh love and cry with the town from avonlea
i stayed up all night reading this book not only because the info was so good but it is extremely humorous and entertaining i recommend this book to anyone who cares about their dog
i bought this book as a last resort on how to deal with my she was a horrible mannered now she is better behaved and minds three huge cheers to joy tiz for her awesome book and understanding of what makes a dog tick ! ! ! ! i also keep on on her websites for more info as i go to write another book joy
joy actually understands dogs and temperment i can not believe how many books i have read that were written by people who did n't have the slightest clue what made dogs tick
i bought this book eventhough i own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious bridget jones 's diary the book is equally as funny it differs slightly from the movie but not too much this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of bridget jones it 's a very well written quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time i recommend it to all
there was a lot of hype surrounding this book with the movie and all and after reading i have to say i fell in love with it ! jones is the perfect chick lit heroine and she made me laugh so many times ! a book that is this good is a rare treat so do n't pass it up if you have n't read it yet ! along with it i also recommend heartbreaker '' by kim corum another good chick lit book
if you have n't read this book it 's a must it 's a classic early version of chick flick this is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it 's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90 's still a national best seller it is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet is n't that all of us in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 hilarious or is it a droll sense of humor a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too do you want to lose 7 lbs stop smoking and develop inner poise well see how bridget does or does n't do all of that in bridget jones summer read great airplane reading fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids food family and chaos ! good too it at the summer house for guest
this book is funny no one can doubt that the reader can truely feel the joy the sadness the hope the loss the success and the failure that bridget jones feels from page to page the movie is indeed hilarious and to some extent better than the book do not expect flowery writing styles like that of maya angelou expect a more simplified style such as that of meg cabbot although more 'adult ' as it were intelligent and expect a good which keeps you rooting for the character to find the perfect who will love all fluxuating 131 lbs of her and keep her mother quiet all at the same time most greatly however you wish nothing less than for her to be happy with the bridget jones that you will grow to love most certainly reccomend good or
all women have their problems but for bridget jones with her seemingly permanent single life for which all of her married acquaintances obsessively harass her about her habit of drinking a little too much and her trouble with her weight which seems to mysteriously rocket up and down the poor thing just ca n't seem to catch a break an instantly lovable character bridget is real and her complaints about life and men are often hilarious and believable her conversations with her friends are also extremely enjoyable as they dish and grumble about all the things that men do wrong which you know are quite a lot often her musings and thoughts the what 's wrong with me '' and her dieting and attempts at positive reinforcement are very entertaining very funny book that is different in several ways from the movie so if you have seen the movie try the book books
i rarely like a movie better than the book but it seems that sometimes a director knows when to cut out unfavorable aspects better than a book editor this was still a very good book and i highly recommend it
after seeing the movie i decided to pick up the book this book proved to be very funny as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many many women her age face today fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true often serious topics being single and not liking it infidelity betrayal and is yet able turn it into light funny reading that takes talent in my book in the wrong hands this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read in light of the above topics you cant help but root for bridget i recommend this book and its sequel most everyone will get a good laugh out of it
go buy this book you 'll read it over and over and laugh every single time bridget jones is my hero she tries so hard to be perfect but poor thing she is like the rest of us woefully insecure and less than perfect almost everyone has seen the movie which was excellent but the book is twice as good if you love romantic comedies you 'll love bridget jones
in this short work by manly hall he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of plato and pythagoras however the principles are generally the same silence is still of utmost importance in the times of pythagoras silence was not only a virtue but something your life depended upon today you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society however your integrity and will are disseminated silence today stands as a virtue more than anything but one that most people neglect this short book also looks into the practices of the student disciple and initiate as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school even today all of these attitudes that hall speaks about have complete practicality in today 's culture it is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner if one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible but inspirational for those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with
this is a pretty exceptional book there are three major strengths of the book from the perspective of shaara 's writing ability first michael shaara has the rare ability to describe battle scenes including the horror and chaos in a manner that makes these battles accessible and realistic and immediate to the reader very few writers have this gift tolstoy was able to capture the cat and mouse game between napoleon and czar alexander the great in war and peace victor hugo was able to capture the chaos of waterloo in les miserables ian mcewan captures the sad retreat to dunkirk in atonement robert graves captures trench warfare during world war i in goodbye to all that and joseph heller captures the absurdity of war in catch 22. i would have to say that michael shaara comes very close to the writing skills of tolstoy hugo mcewan heller and graves in terms of describing the unfolding of battle second michael shaara is a master at capturing the male or masculine mind i do not mean to be stereotypical here but it is very much a man 's book i say this because michael shaara was able to capture male friendship male envy and competition male humor which can be dark sarcastic and gross and the manner in which males respond to a chain of command third shaara is superb at developing individual characters exploring the internal dynamics that make them 'tick ' and that lead them to take the actions and positions that they take under certain conditions such as the stress of warfare this aspect of the book was fascinating the portrait of general lee was fair and balanced lee was suffering from cardiovascular disease and was the retired head of west point as a military theoretician he was still under the influence of napoleon bonaparte 's military theories he wished to be well informed so as to make the best decisions and then to engage the enemy when he thought he had the advantage he is usually contrasted with the union general mcclellan who frustrated president lincoln because of mcclellan 's continuous delays and preparations and avoidance of engagement with the enemy however general lee failed to adjust his military strategy to the improvement in firearms technology it is general longstreet who is one of the two most interesting characters in the story for longstreet recognized that improved firearm technology changed the equation in regard to battleground tactics longstreet 's conceptions were not appreciated during the civil war and unfortunately were not appreciated during world war i when so many of europe 's young men died senseless deaths by charging machine guns the character of joshua lawrence chamberlain is a wonderful counterpoint to longstreet longstreet is in constant mourning for his four children all of whom died in one day of fever chamberlain on the other hand is pschologically very healthy with the ability to respond to those around him with a healthy range of emotions longstreet was a military genius but unfortunately a genius that was unrecognized as such because of the aura and mantle of sainthood that the south had conveyed onto general lee chamberlain on the other hand was a college professor who was not trained to be a soldier but who was extremely pragmatic and resourceful this is a very enjoyable book full of history well written
even if you do not read historic novels you will love this one the author lets you see inside the characters so it is history book that is nothing like the ones you read in school
this novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason it 's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details the commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps shelby foote 's brilliant trilogy the movie gettysburg '' was based on this novel if you love historical fiction and the civil war you must read this fantastic book the author 's son has made quite a career jeff shaara out of writing a series of novels based upon this one before and after gettysburg which is the setting for killer angels unfortunately in this instance the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned steer clear of the jeff shaara books and read the histories instead but if you need a civil war novel you 're likely to find no better one than this
for history buffs students and civil war fanatics i would advise them to read this book and then see the movies gettysburg '' that was made a few years ago the books is about as sharp as one can get when covering the horrors of war the characterizations are very sharp as and the story telling from the beginning of the battle to after its end is about as accurate as it comes sometimes one can actually see the action and often it is disturbing this novel should be required reading in high school and college history classes
this is a gret read for anyone who is a civil war history buff great character developement plot an easy read about a topic which has an overwhelming amount of information if you liked gods and generals '' you should enjoy this one
i bought the book while in gettysburg and read it nonstop on the flight home it 's a quick read and will definitely keep your interest i highly recommend the movie gettysburg as well and having read the book will provide deeper insight than what a movie can do above all visit gettysburg as touring the sites and seeing the terrain will make the killer angels come alive it did for me
this is a great book which i would classify as a historical novel i read it before i went out to gettysburg along with all the two others in the series which are just as fabulous i love the civil war and work in archives cataloging many actual civil war letter and artifacts however to someone who was not too interested in the war history or is younger this might not be a good book for them nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories in the book expect many reports about troop movements war is 99 boredom 1 sheer terror expect lots of inner monologues speeches and flowery language because that is how it was in the victorian era it is the truth i have read enough letters to prove it i can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books i have read but it is not for everyone as for the movies based on this series gettysburg and gods and generals they have to be the most boring movies i have ever seen just awful read the book over watching the movie
i wholeheartedly recommend this historical novel to anyone interested in learning about the civil war in fact i recommend this book to anyone not interested in the civil war this is the first civil war novel i have read and i was completely captivated michael shaara gave life to many of the key figures in the civil war 's most famous battle although much of the interior dialogue is fiction based on historical documents the details of the action stay true to history shaara provides amazing insight into the essence of the war the cause '' and provokes a feeling of kinship with officers from both sides of the battlefield michael shaara has created an historical fiction that compels me to learn more about the details of these great american figures that he has truly made come to life
there are not enough words in webster 's dictionary to describe all the feelings one experiences while reading this book its hero suprisingly is union cavalry general john buford who is the first to ride into gettysburg in july 1 1863. if not for his brilliantly executed of gettysburg and the surrounding heights on that first day the union army would have lost that battle and probably the war shortly thereafter this book is worth reading just to learn about buford who is almost never historically recognized for his role in the battle and who mysteriously disappears from the battle after day one
this is an excellent book if you are interested in writing horror it takes you though each aspect of the genre step by step the exercises in the book are useful too i recommend this book to anyone interested in writing horror
i 've been writing since i was 15 but i 've lacked the initiative and experience to finish a story now that i 've read writing horror i 've done the exercises and finished a few stories i found the sections on the seven steps of plotting and the five ways to open a story immensely helpful the exercises and advice are geared towards short story writing although there 's a few helpful hints about book length fiction throughout the book van belkom stresses how hard the publishing industry is only those who stick it out will make it in this business also of note being a fellow canadian it 's refreshing to see a writing book told from the perspective of a canadian author use this book to write a story and renni browne 's self editing for fiction writers to edit it into print i ca n't recommend this book enough
you know you 're in good hands when you open this book but it takes more than just an incredible set of credentials bram stoker award several novels and over 15 anthology appearances to be an effective teacher it takes a broad understanding of the writing craft and business and an organized approach all of which van belkom has with this book it 's a fast 216 pages informative primer for new horror writers and perhaps a nice refresher for the pros covering all the topics a book like this should such as composition marketing and the current state of the genre van belkom is at his best when he dissects his own stories and experiences for the reader 's benefit i 'm just disappointed he did n't give us more more meat as they say if you 're still in the stage writing horror has a flexible paper cover that 's perfect for folding over when you 're on a crowded subway
about 20 years ago i bemoaned the lack of heroes in our society the '' the guys had taken over and there were only the ones you love to hate in the spotlight cormack mccarthy wrote the first volume of his trilogy around the same time and i found some of the heroes i 'd been looking for mccarthy has n't created his cowboy heroes he communicated or maybe channeled '' them it really seems to me that like some of the ancient storytellers he serves as a medium for the ancient voices that is not meant to minimize mccarthy 's talent has been more successful as he in capturing the language and personalities of real cowboys cowboy '' is more than a little ambiguous in our language some use the word to describe those who would take advantage of opportunities to scratch advantage from others without regard to conventional ethics or morality but for me and others it suggests the rugged individualist who follows his own path his own code in the pursuit of his goals maybe there 's no place for cowboys in our current society and maybe that 's too ba
incredible one of the best novels i have ever had the pleasure to read mccarthy is a master story teller i have never read a book by him i did not fall in love with bruce dodso
in recent years a lot of people have noticed that book clubs demand a lot of books no surprise but the next conclusion is that the taste of book club audiences influence what gets published i think this is why we have books like the devil wore prada '' that are soon followed by prep '' this is why people who read evensong '' soon pick up brick lane '' and the liars club '' my wife belongs to a book club they have read all of these books if men participated in books clubs to the same extent that women do and i wish that they did then cormac mccarthy novels would spawn their own genre cities of the plain is not about balancing your career with your relationships it is not about good shoes or good sex it is about important things like falling in love with the impossibly wrong girl it is about vast open spaces that leave room for men to make decisions maybe that is what it takes also it is about horses and guns and blood and honor this is oversimplification there is a specific plot john grady cole works with his friend billy parham on a ranch near the border with mexico john grady falls in love with a prostitute at a brothel on the other side he wants to marry her their union is john grady feels that he loves her to him his love is worthless if it not worth dying for that is the question he faces i encourage people to read this book it is the last in a trilogy it was my favorite of all three
i usually read every night to my wife we 've gone through dozens of books together in our marriage and several months ago i read all the pretty horses '' to her she loved it and would not let me read her anything else until we had read mccarthy 's entire trilogy we just finished it this book the third in that trilogy has its shortcomings but it is still one amazing piece of work in this book john grady cole the genius horsetrainer of all the pretty horses '' and billy parham the kindhearted nomad of the crossing '' come together as ranch hands on a new mexico estancia both are older than they were in the previous books billy much older but both are kindred spirits whose stories connect with and affect each another the book tends more heavily toward the lengthy philosophical monologues that appear only occasionally in the trilogy 's earlier volumes and the whole story at momemnts goes a little bit long if you 've just read the two previous volumes right before however the writing is gorgeous and haunting for example in one passage a dead calf 's ribcage lay with curved tines upturned on the gravel plain like some carnivorous plant brooding in the barren dawn '' yeah and the ending the ending is amazing it might not be quite what you expect or ask for but it is thrilling in its perfectness in its completess in how true it feels it left me holding the book like a priceless religious relic its back cover flipping back through it to parts i had marked reluctant and unwilling to let go of these characters or their world cormac mccarthy is a literary genius he has made the west tangible taken its most ineffable qualities and turned them into words he makes me homesick for the place i already live do not start with this book if you 've never read his other works but do work up to it do read it
cities on the plain is the final volume in cormac mccarthy 's border trilogy a loosely tied together trio of novels that deal with life along the border this novel focuses on the protagonists of each of the first two books john grady cole from all the pretty horses and billy parham from the crossing now the two of them are working together on a ranch in new mexico in the early the rather sketchy plot involves cole who has fallen hard for a mexican prostitute his love for her has more than a little bit of obsession to it and cole is willing to risk all to be with her it is his eventual intent to bring her to the and marry her although her pimp may have other ideas at times however the story is secondary as we follow the other smaller adventures in these characters ' lives mccarthy 's great gifts are with his descriptive ability he is not always an easy read however he never uses quotes to set off his dialogue and he uses a lot of spanish much of which is left untranslated and for a speaker can only be partially gleaned from context despite these difficulties the book is somehow a pleasure to read although it is probably the weakest in the trilogy in some ways it is reminiscent of the movie brokeback mountain if only because it follows the rough life of modern cowboys cole and parham live tough lives with little hope of any permanence or prosperity but they are also somewhat content with their choices mccarthy is probably an overrated writer with his distinct style providing an illusion of greater ability than he actually has but even if he is not great he is still good and if you have the patience you may find this an enjoyable book
this final installment to the border trilogy like the preceding volumes stands on it own but stands on it 's own less than either of the other two this would n't be the book to read if you 've never read big mac before if you 're a hardcore reader go for blood meridian his best or suttree his other best if you 're testing the water and only used to reading pop crime novls or medical mysteries and want to delve a little deeper start with all the pretty horses and work your way into the rest what 's it like think of faulkner then have him write a john steinbeck story with hemmigway editing mac is better than steinbeck has more flower than hemmingway not as much as faulkner but make no mistake he work is peer to the old masters america 's finest living author
this final novel in cormac mccarthy 's border trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes mccarthy has developed throughout the trilogy in the first novel all the pretty horses mccarthy stresses the romanticism of john grady cole who runs away to become a cowboy suffers a loss at love and returns sadder and perhaps wiser to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains times are changing as the century progresses however and the independent life of ranchers is threatened in the crossing a far darker novel which takes place a few years later billy parham another young man takes off with his brother crossing the border into mexico to explore its older traditions and ways of life cities of the plain with biblical suggestions in the title brings young john grady cole and the older billy parham together as they work on the mcgovern ranch in texas in the the wilderness is disappearing cities are encroaching and an army base may take their land focusing less on the harshness of ranch life than in past novels mccarthy here concentrates more on character in this case that of john grady cole who falls in love with a prostitute from juarez and wants to bring her across the border to his way of life billy parham counsels him against marrying her but john grady is determined to wrest her away from eduardo her manager and give her the peace that she has never known life is harsh however and outcomes are bleak for dreamers and altruists john grady soon finds himself engaged in a struggle with eduardo which is vicious and unrelenting a metaphorical struggle between honor and evil and between civilized values and the justice '' of tooth and claw hope and desperation and acceptance of change and adherence to the past mccarthy 's gorgeous descriptions of this vanishing way of life on the ranch are as effective here as they are in the other novels in the trilogy though they seem to be presented nostalgically times are changing and the old man '' the ranch owner is now becoming senile civilization is drawing closer and john grady the cowboy uses taxis instead of horses when he is in a hurry to travel as mccarthy draws the reader into john grady 's story the reader knows that the struggle between him and eduardo is a mythic struggle and also knows what the likely outcome will be the elegance with which the ending is drawn however gives both potency and poignancy to mccarthy 's message mary whipple
read this book at a light warehouse because you will not want to be anywhere near the dark !
it is one of my favorite stephen king novels i 've ever read possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books it is extremely long and i must admit that i had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it i know it 's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long this novel has some of the best character development i 've ever read and the reader gets a chance to really get to know each character even a chance to know more about each character that you might care to highly recommended even if you are n't a king fan
when i first read this book upon finishing it i immediately proceeded to rip it 's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces that was how much the story affected me it disgusted me it disturbed me it moved me after brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head and if that 's not the mark of a great writer i do n't know what is i then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again amid all the horror that stephen king has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination this has to be the most disturbing disgusting and at times offensive work he has ever set to paper forget the movie this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath with this book and the tommyknockers '' stephen king has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer but a great writer period buy it read it
although i 'm only 14 year old boy who lives in utah i 've been a die hard stephen king fan since i was twelve and i have to say this is really the high light of his career do n't be turned off by the massive length of this book it goes by very quickly and you 'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages as i 'm sure you know this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges other people have already gone over the basic story but one thing that most of them failed to mention that i find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it all of them but mike hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it yes this book is vulgar it is violent and there is some sexuality it is an essential part of the story it is over a thousand pages long and each page is genius i will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book i 've ever read because it 's so much more than a horror story i think this book has greater characters than any other book i have ever read this is a five star book and is almost completely flawless this is my favorite book and some of stephen king 's other great works are the dead zone misery the shining and christine read this book it is well worth your time i wo n't go in depth into the story because hundreds of other people already have but this book will scare the piss out of you make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it and really just change you i ca n't express in words how great this is but do n't take my word for it buy it rent it whatever just read it no pun intended
wow what an epic the book draws you in to the sinister world of derry maine so quickly and deeply that you do n't want to leave when the last page is read with a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story but this world is so full of rich characters these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish i originally read this book in high school after my first 15 years later the horror of the what goes on in the town of derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me however the adventure and wonderment i pulled from the story then came flooding back again the first half of the book is a coming of age story with evil stalking the town as a backdrop the second half of the book is a story of and responsibility with evil lurking closer in each character 's shadows just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children
a book that enables you to travel back in time back to 1958 back to a time when there was stan mike richie bev eddie ben and big bill and some others back when some kids ' main concern was avoiding henry bowers ! a story that although long over a thousand pages and in 'it ' years probably much longer kept my attention throughout maybe you 'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear fear of the unknown and fear of the known a chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences so that you really care what happens to them good and bad !

i eagerly awaited this next installment of the artemis fowl series would eoin colfer handle success and continue to put his best effort forward yes ! this book exceeds expectations i recommend it to all ages if you like humor a fine plot deftly woven beautifully written prose with a philosophically rich sub plot this book is for you
it was great can not wait for his next boo
artemis fowl is back finally ! i was terrified that my favorite irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author eoin colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old artemis but fortunately the boy genius has n't been forgotten he 's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the fantasy series as the lost colony opens artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty while that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction but it 's that kind of multitasking that has made artemis fowl an international sensation the lost colony has all the elements that fowl fans have come to expect including a dizzying array of gadgets danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources ingenious plans and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal this book also includes a few new characters who were for the most part likeable and fun the one notable exception is a french girl who could give artemis a run for his money in the genius category she is pretty rich and highly annoying i often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would accidentally '' dunk her in a sewer or shave her head or something equally unpleasant is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character no i do n't think so and you 'll understand what i mean once you read the book fans of the artemis fowl series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure there were a few problems with the story including some descriptions of how artemis and company escape their latest predicament and an irritating french girl see above overall though i found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop and as always i was left wondering what mischief artemis will dream up next reviewed by osborn sulliva
this is by far one of my favorite series of all times it far surpasses hp in my eyes i know blasphemy right lol i love the twist on the ending and the set up for the next book there will be a next book right a must read for anyone who enjoys the blend of genres and eoin colfer
the detox miracle was written for those who know that a yearly detox is just one step on the road to wellness most doctors acknowledge that many illnesses have their origin in the gradual accumulation of junk and gunk in the liver kidneys and bloodstream what authors peter bennett and stephen barrie have done was to write a text that is somewhere in the middle between a primer for the layman and a more advanced text for serious students of medicine and health they devote the first seven chapters to a scholarly yet readable theoretical explanation as to what a detox is what it is not why we need one and the various lab tests that allow you to optimize and individualize a detox program the part of the book i found a needed warmup for the actual process itself was the authors description for a dedication for a week long task that may disrupt one 's life style for that week essentially they recommend that one ought to take a series of tests prior to the detox that range from chemistry screen testing to ph testing and to oxidative stress testing since these tests require the intervention of qualified health care professionals it makes sense not to act precipitously without outside help once you know what shape your body is in relative to potential toxic excesses then the program as outlined in this book not only makes sense but is seen as a necessary treatment either to eliminate these toxins or to make sure that you never get them once you commit to a detox the authors suggest a 1 or 2 day fast supplemented by liquid intake the diet they urge you to follow for the next 5 days is a helpful and healthy regimin of brown rice selected fruits and vegetables and green barley all of which form the basis of an ongoing diet what i found most useful about this text is that the authors do not mandate any one aspect of their detox program indeed if you were to adopt even just one part of it then you would benefit in my case my health was pretty good going into the process so i decided to skip the fasting component and focus on those foods and supplements that act as natural detoxifiers after a week of eliminating from my diet those foods that were deleterious mostly saturated fat based and adding those that were benign i noticed that i simply felt better a recent physical exam following my partial detox revealed a much lowered cholesterol count and a strong overall constitution i recommend the detox miracle because it is clearly written is based on sound medical principles and provides many tips and suggestions on how to maintain your health after the intitial week 's program is over
i am almost finished with the book and although i have not done the detox yet i am very excited about trying it this book was very informative as well as easy to read and lays out the plan for you i also like that they give you suggestions for before during and after the detoxification i ca n't wait to try it
my girlfriend and i both felt the need to do some cleansing and heard about this book through natural cures they do n't want you to know about we started it on a saturday so we could do the water fast on the weekend very good idea i was amazed how i had not problem with hunger and even though i have to watch my blood sugar level there was no problem we felt so great when we were done this is something i think we will do at least once a year
i do n't know why this awesome book has negative reviews here it is a little difficult true but for a new yorkphile like me it ca n't be beat if you want to know new york in the 1920 's and to a lesser degree the nation all the familiar names are covered scott and zelda woolcott parker gerstein stein freud jazz and ellington among many others new york as a huge rush for outsiders from their first sight the skyscraper boom and builders and architects the movie extreme dangers of transatlantic flights and coast to coast mail deliveries the harlem renaissance basically the city as a reinventing percolating damon runyan irving berlin web dubois singing the blues mary pickford babe ruth jimmy walker the fun loving mayor with questionable morals the great white way the cotton club it is just about an endless ride thru this great town in the 1920 's and beyond including the aftershock of the 1930 's sometimes a little difficult but you can browse through the index too and find hundreds of worthy subjects to check out one of the best journeys through a time and place that i know ! ! also with some interesting photos too
i agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts the book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics society religion politics and of course physics have affected each other it goes both ways ! through out the ages furthermore the author nicely illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes have also changed through the ages the age of reason versus the renisance this book left me with real insights as to the nature and limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics things are not as they seem my friend ! lastly the author displays an appreciation for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put down at times i never thought a book could be a page turner '' read it
for the reader who just needs a gentle boost to get atop the masks of nietzsche this book will enable you to appreciate sophistication that you may not have even known was there not coffee table material but palpably attractive to the discerning mind
what a great book ! 420 pages hardback and every single page is worth reading not one page is boring you just want to keep reading and keep turning pages ! this is my first nora roberts ' book i ca n't believe how good she writes ! i would recommend this book to everyone ! it 's got murder mystery romance people the love of the land i 'd love to find another book like this one ! i really enjoyed it i 'll let the other reviewers tell you about the story i 'm not so good at that
i 've read quite a few of nora roberts 's books and this was the only one on which i had the complete 'wowzer ' reaction i mean seriously wow this is a book full of content with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks reading and rereading it to get it all ms roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the olympic rain forest the characters are likable and believable and most certainly not your average roberts book livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as noah could be a persistent annoyance and readers will find themselves grieving for julie macbride along with jamie rob val david and livvy herself and there 's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling
when i started reading river 's end it reminded me of a remake of the simpson '' murder it is a story centered on a little old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father years pass by and the story unravels olivia 's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy written in the ingenious nora roberts style i have grown to truly enjoy this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the olympic rain forest through olivia 's eyes i guessed the villain about way through the book but the story still held my interest as i could never be 100 sure i was correct i would highly recommend this book to everyone
in river 's end nora roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years a story of hollywood 's glamour gone astray and the young girl who survived it but this is n't a typical plot by any means not with roberts ' doing the writing she guarantees many unexpected events along the way ! the tale of a pair of hollywood stars living the life many only dream of living a young child who can grow up to have it all until murder and mayhem reeks havoc in their lives the mother is dead and the father is in jail and olivia the little girl who had it all is forced to forget it all in order to save her own sanity olivia is raised by her grandparents in the pacific northwest and has been shielded from her past until those events are once again brought to the headlines when her father is released from prison a young writer noah brady is the son of the investigating police officer to this crime and he wants to tell the story that no one has been allowed to hear noah digs up long buried ghosts and stirs the pot to bring the monsters back with her father out of prison and revenge on the killer 's mind you have to wait until the end of the book until many subplots are solved was her mother 's killer her father or someone else who is the monster that wants this story buried and never told can olivia and noah 's love survive this ordeal as an avid mystery lover and a nora roberts ' fan i have to say that she just keeps getting better and better this one almost had me fooled very few actually do fool me and i was my idea of the villain until almost the end
some may not consider this one of her best indeed it is n't listed as a fav anywhere but it had enough nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything i could there after pacing was good twists were good and i was right there in hollywood the forest everywhere her characters were detail in descirbing the forests got a little bogged down but i waded through it i cried at the end a first for me ! until i read her other books i would n't read this first if you 're just discovering nora there are other books that put the awe in awesome check those out then come to this one
i could n't put this book down it was so good it was such a surprise because by reading the inside cover it does n't sound at all good but i gave it a try and i 'm glad i did it 's definatly become one of my favorites this year the story comes alive for you
a good compendium of advice for individuals managers and investors alike who want to prevent themselves from being hoodwinked by corporate fraud i read this book after completing another new book wall street versus america by gary weiss i think that they compliment each other quite well the weiss book has a more muckraking tone and is a swifter read but this book is stronger in other areas not covered by weiss definitely a book that needs to be and should be read
this book changed the way i invest it is a must read before putting your money on the line
jim cramer gets it right this book is one of most valuable i have ever read in terms of helping me invest my money and i 've read alot it teaches the reader what to look for to make sure they are investing in good sound companies and not the enron 's of the world it is one thing to find an exciting stock it is another to have the confidence to know that you are n't getting swindled this book gave me that confidence
a great read going through the last years of corporate fraudsters the authors really make history and the characters come alive through their storytelling they also bring out amazing parallels among the frauds and show how people could have spotted the dangers before they lost everything good lessons to know and to keep in mind for the future a great book
i listened to the cd version wow ! what a ride ! this was my first vince flynn book but it surely wo n't be my last ! violent sure but fun !
vince flynn started his series of mitch rapp books about a decade ago actually the first book he wrote was n't even part of the series but all of the other ones since have been all of his books have a political element to them and all of them are thrillers written with a protagonist who kills first and half the time does n't bother asking questions later they 're all long and as flynn has continued to write the books have gotten longer of the four i 've read in sequence the lengths were in order ca 430 480 530 and 670. those are approximate but about right he 's actually getting better though something that happens to these guys sometimes a good analogy here is tom clancy clancy 's first book the hunt for red october is pretty poorly written if you go back and look at it now the dialog especially is terrible and the same thing holds true for patriot games which i 've read was written first but published second as he 's progressed though clancy has gotten better editors and as a result the books he writes are better too the same effect has apparently occurred with flynn the dialog 's better there are n't quite as many preachy speeches about how we need to defend ourselves and he still keeps the plot moving along nicely in the current installment rapp is pursued by an assassin following a saudi billionaire 's discovery that rapp has killed his son in afghanistan there are various plot twists and developments and frankly you should n't read this book without reading all of the previous ones first but suffice it to say the characters and action are about what a reader of this type of book is looking for recommended
i enjoyed the novel very much mitch rapp is an excellent author but he needs better proof readers i could not believe the number of errors that i noticed as i was reading i would love to offer my services but i do not know where to make that request i did go to his web sight and found an email address but no response from it i taught high school english for years and read thousands of essays for seniors this is not the forum for this complaint but i know no other thanks dale hage
his best one yet ! mitch rapp gets turned loose in this one the bad guys get what 's coming to them at home and abroad
perhaps it 's political intrigue which interests if so vince flynn 's consent to kill is now in paperback and provides a thriller based on modern headlines and terrorist concerns mitch becomes the target of an international conspiracy for his struggles to preserve freedom consent to kill shows his evolution from hunter to prey as he 's stalked by dangerous unseen forces for his past 'crimes ' an outstanding and engrossing leisure choice
vince flynn changes up the chase and instead of mitch rapp being the hunter he is now the hunted i am glad i waited for it in paperback so i could get an excerpt from vince flynn 's new mitch rapp thriller act of treason but i am never waiting again i started mitch rapp 's adventures from the begging in term limits and have not been able to stop after reading all seven books you would think that the twists and turns would be exhausted however vince finds a way to give us more i recommend his style and this series
although he 's been publishing books for a little while i still tend to think of vince flynn as one of the new faces in spy fiction compared to folks like lecarre clancy higgins or deighton flynn is a youngster but that does n't mean he ca n't hold his own against the veterans in fact compared to tom clancy who in certain stylistic ways is probably who flynn is most similar to flynn is actually the better writer in consent to kill he again delivers a fast reading thriller consent to kill features flynn 's principal series character mitch rapp mitch is a in the james bond mold which is to say he is something more than human indeed much of the early part of the book reiterates just how formidable rapp is he eliminates a terrorist cleric with ease he is recruited by a couple politicians to head a black ops '' group and most significantly he becomes the target of an assassination rapp has such a reputation in the espionage community that few are even willing to take on the job knowing that rapp is tough to kill and failure will unleash his unstoppable fury erich abel german spymaster acts as the middleman in the deal and he winds up hiring louis gould a brilliant assassin who works in conjunction with his lover claudia she does the paperwork he does the wet work at first oblivious to the threat rapp spends time forming his secret group and tangling with mark ross the new director of national intelligence in flynn 's books government employees are only two sorts people of action like rapp and his boss irene kennedy or useless bureaucrats ross is the latter a couple parallel stories develop rapp finds out his wife anna is pregnant just as gould finds out the same about claudia there is a certain irony that flynn exploits but never overuses in the similarities and differences in the way the two couples act one merely needs to look at the back of the paperback version of consent to kill which promotes the next mitch rapp novel to know that he is likely to survive the events of this book on the other hand no other character is as safe so there is still plenty of suspense even with reasonable certainty about rapp himself with rapp himself the target of an operation rather than the one running it we get probably a deeper look into his character than ever before but not too deep flynn never focuses more on emotions than need be as a result we get to see that rapp despite all his strengths is n't perfect and the novel is stronger as a result though part of a series consent to kill stands alone well if you like it you can go back and read flynn 's other works they 're all at least decent and some are really good this is a fast read and an enjoyable one
well the previous 2 books were showing that mitch was losing his motivation to be dirty and they were mostly action and no further character building but after this one motivation is back i agree that the character building in this one is far greater than in the previuous books but it is not boring considering that newer and deeper motivations and games are played at the end is predictable but nonetheless hard to put down vince flynn has revived the series which was becoming dull
the mitch rapp series gets better and better with each installment ctk was great very difficult to put down the story was definitely more emotional than it has been in the past which really took it to a whole new level i ca n't wait for act of treason to hit the shelves flynn 's writing is leaps and bounds better than his first couple of books he has really come into his own as a writer 5 stars here is a no brainer
as a professional health specialist i have read extensively about natural progesterone cream and hormones since my diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001 and have been using it since that time instead of the drugs and radiotherapy recommended by my doctors dr lee 's work is remarkable but you must read carefully otherwise you will be under misapprehensions like some of these other reviewers who are still making mistakes about the difference between natural progesterone and synthetic progestins ! they are molecularly different and natural progesterone does not carry the same side effects or risks that the synthetic ones do ! i am the hormone health expert for the cma and bio vitality limited where we also advocate hormone testing so that you do not supplement if you do not need it ! it 's really what the doctors should be doing before they give out hormones of any description
thank you lee for your book ! i was on a calculated plan of natural progesterone for approximately 8 months which corrected many of the issues brought on by synthetic progestogens contrary to what some people are writing in their reviews natural progesterone is not the same as the synthetic progestogens found in birth control pills or nor can natural progesterone be used at the same amount each month or forever i for one can not use synthetic progestogens because of the problems they cause leg cramping sleeplessness mood changes blood clots weight gain to mention a few dosage of natural progesterone totally depends on physical monthly needs of the individual months a little more some months a little less and always under the guidance of physicians who understand and support the use of natural progesterone hurray to those who bring this information to the forefront and are not slaves of the pharmaceutical companies
this book brings to life a survival struggle that is often hard to fathom in addition to the sailors story the author adds interesting information on a variety of topics including history science geography book is worth reading
this story was incredible ! some of the things these men had to do to survive were truly inhuman and at times appalling even so th ebook is engaging from page 1 to the end amazing what the mind can do to keep the body from dying and what it can do to make the body give up this book had me angry relieved amazed and at all times entertained i highly recommend it !
an absolutely spellbinding story ! hard to believe the hardship faced by the crew of the commerce this book made me become quite interested in the sahara on which i 've read considerably since
this was a really really good book and a true story beware though the first 50 pages are slow do n't worry if you ca n't keep the characters straight you will keep the main ones straight shortly enough perservere the slow beginning and the story is well well worth it
shipwrecked and held captive by muslim slavers this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down i have deliberately not read the ending because i do n't want the experience to end with every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive because they are christians and therefore dog dung '' is beyond human endurance their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book i have ever read of this genre i am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience
i 'm an avid reader of real life adventure stories especially ones that bring out survival instincts in the face of tragedy and deprival this is one of the best true stories i have ever read dean king brings to life the historical background of the shipping industry in the early the adventures of world trade by sea and most of all brutal slavery and daily raw survival in the sahara desert every imaginable horror occurs to the shiprecked crew and yet many of them make there way to eventual safety incredible
the food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the sahara desert in the 1800 's they also endured slavery starvation intense heat and thirst and the strange customs of their captors but like any good story the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture this book 's vivid portrayal of life in the sahara and the communistic principles of the bedouins that live there is riveting reading by the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their muslim captors indeed both the reader and the sailors become victims of the stockholm syndrome whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor despite your own travails i 've read hundreds of adventure stories both modern and historical and this is one of the best combining adventure history sociology and geography in a thoroughly riveting tale of suffering and redemption tales where those who must endure are doing it as part of legitimate scientific commercial or other interests are always more compelling than those adventure stories based on mere adrenalin or adventure seeking participants who stumble into disaster highly recommended
the story of the 1815 wreck of the american cargo ship commerce is a gripping and heroic tale of survival and a tribute to the human spirit this book will grip you until the final page and leave you exhausted and amazed at their ability to withstand a seemingly hopeless situation
the pure scope of the brutish horrors these men endured is a wonderful look into the human spirit and the natural will to survive many of the men never returned home but for the ones who did this was a complete and ultimately satisfying portrayal of survival
history has always been an odd beast to me i must say what is the goal of an historian precisely can one man really summarize the actions of thousands of men and bevies of political machinations among other things in a page narrative does a static '' past really exist such pressing concerns you see i believe that history is inherently reductionist and can not remotely address these issues so i value texts that have value as historiography moreso than the events that they supposedly describe and if you want that there is no better place to look than at the fathers of historical narrative thucydides and herodotus of course i am still in the process of reading this book but i do not think that i have to wait to finish before reviewing it thucydides is concerned with accuracy '' of details he did thorough fact checks as best as he was able to and he attempts to take an impersonal objective '' tone these concerns show up repeatedly throughout the text along with a knack for writing good oratory when it suits the occasion all well and good you say modern historians have been doing these very things for years and most of us can appreciate those details without reading the book well there is another element that i appreciate here and one that is perhaps unintentional on thucydides ' part he constantly writes about power ! who conquers who who has the power who is in control battles for power and control etc and as the historian he is ultimately the man who controls everything he has power over us and controls the people whom we read about the events that we read about and so on therefore i find this text to be rich precisely because he is constantly referencing back to his own power and control and with history there is perhaps no better lesson to be learned a few minor notes the lack of maps in the penguin edition is a real travesty it would be nice to follow the conflicts as they occur but that is rather undoable the translation is perfectly fine to me but that aspect does not concern me as much thucydides was an astute fellow and as such you can expect to find more than a few insightful segments of text in this book so it is worth it to read this book for those nuggets as well finally i am a dilettante so i do not know much about this subject the other reviews will be able to fill you in on the context of this book as well as on the man himself
more than a simple historical treatise it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history a classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history thucydides is unmatched in his insights clarity of language and thought and in his informative description of the history of his time a must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos an enjoyable read for any historiphile it could use more maps but be sure to check the back of the book for the few it does have
i had studied greek history for quite some time before i finally did myself the greatest favor thus far in my life and purchased thucydides ' account of the peloponnesian war for my collection at the time i had already read herodotus at least 3 or 4 times in full along with all sorts of other greek texts available i was in love with herodotus enjoying with skepticism his regaling of myths as fact particularly the presense of oracles and their relation to the events he described which still fascinates me in spite of the doubt i feel towards divine intervention at that point i had known of thucydides at some time but it was not until i had exhausted almost every available source of spartan knowledge did i at last turn to him like many other reviewers have noted i had heard all the remarks of his dry style of writing and the difficulty of the read but after reading herodotus plutarch xenophon and the like i came to crave nothing but an objective account of greek history i have just finished thucydides and it took about five days in no way did i find it dry or in any way difficult to read it seemed even easier to read than the others as i knew it was of more genuine truth than any greek work on their history i had read reading the iliad for example is marvelous fun and one can not help but become entangled in the lore and heroism that it supplies feeling impressed by these warriors countless times over and amazed at the events that took place but after several readings of it the reality hit me that almost all of it and perhaps none of this legend never actually took place in the way it was recorded same for herodotus with thucydides though here is an reliably accurate for it is almost impossible to construct a flawless history of truth record of a real life confrontation every bit as deserving of lore granted to earlier greek legend his admission that he himself suffered from the plague that ravaged athens at the beginning of the war instantly made the text easier to read it was at this point i fully came to realize this book had been written as the events unfolded or at least heavy notes were taken for later reference rather than after as herodotus had done there is just something so remarkable about a first hand account in real time from an active participant in the events told fully engrossed i read thucydides quicker than any other greek text i have studied do not be put off then by this supposed dryness of his style personally i do not believe in it at all he is obviously trained somewhat in the skills of oratory as his speeches imply and there is nothing better to read in my opinion than a historcal account made by someone with a distaste for falsity it is no more difficult to read that herodotus and in all ways just as fascinating the one obvious criticism is that the work remains unfinished since the final defeat of athens is indeed one of shocking events for such a glorious power i would give anything for the account to be completed in full still it is illogical to study greek history without reading thucydides and if i could restart my studies i undoubtably would have started with him first rather than last
i really have the feeling that i am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work instead this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text first the text is daunting be patient with it and put it down if you need to it pays off i 'm not someone who reads battle scenes with absorption and still i found that if i absorbed the text in small enough doses then i was able to follow with interest second use the appendices at the back the explanations about the spartan and athenian leagues the greek monetary system and the melian dialogues were actually quite helpful in places for reading the text these appendices are provided in the penguin edition of the thucydides third take notes there are a lot of big thoughts and i found that i absorbed them better by writing them down for myself to think about later it is to attempt the history of the peloponnesian war it is also worth it to my mind i got a lot out of reading it even without being a historian with expertise in the time and region give it a try and give it the space that it deserves so it is now reasonable for us to hope that the gods will be kinder to us since by now we deserve their pity rather than their jealousy
this book illustarted how greek people were disunited and enagged in war with one another at the end of this book author mentioned how were commenced to interfer in greek politics
thucydides bc was an insider during the peloponesian war he was an athenian commander who was dismissed after his men lost a battle in spite of the fact of his previous successes this book was an attempt at an honest historical assessment of the peloponesian war which was not only destructive to the athenians and eventually the spartans but the war was also ruinous to their allies the important theme of this book is that athenian hubris replaced practicle thinking leading to athenian imperialism and war thucydides investigated this war by examining battle sites interviewing both athenian and spartan commanders and inspecting the limited sources that existed for historians at that time he was clear that the primary cause of the peloponesian war was fear of athenian imperialism especially among the spartans and their allies one should note that the athenians not only made enemies of the peloponeisan league the spartans and their allies but the athenians made enemies of those greeks who were neutral but were driven by necessity to join the peloponesian league an important part of theis book which is found in the penguin classics edition can be found on pages thucydides made some poignant remarks regarding how thought and language are corrupted during times of revolution and war he comments that manners and civility collapsed during the peloponesian war he also warned readers that during such crises that thoughtful intelligent men are destroyed because too many people are willing to commit violence on behalf of demogogues rather than engage in calm reflection this is in line with the chapter on von hayek 's the road to serfdom titled why the worst get on top '' if one follows thucydides the history of the peloponesian war carefully they will discover that the athenians had considerable power and wealth yet athenian arrogance and greed resulted in a useless war that resulted in the loss of athenian power and wealth this book is a microcosm of the adage that the bigger an empire is the weaker it is '' this book is useful in examination of the catostophic wars and revolutions of the century george orwell made comment on the corruption of language in his essays and novels expecially 1984. crane briton cites thucydides ' book in briton 's book title anatomy of revolution in other words while this book was written 410 this book is still timely which makes it a classic
why should we take an interest in a war that happened four centuries before the birth of christ it is because this disastrous war between athens and sparta had a major impact on the development of the western world it finally ended in 404 and recent evidence suggests that athens finally succumbed not to force of arms but to typhoid the result of the war was to put an end to hopes of greek unification and it was only a matter of time before the weakened greek cities would fall victim to foreign conquest and lose the freedoms that were the vital essence of greek civilization and their greatest gift to the world the triumph of spartan oligarchy over athenian democracy left a long shadow over the development of western civilization thucydides is considered by many to be the first great critical western historian he was a wealthy athenian who was born around 460 and died around the age of sixty he is chiefly remembered for this important book and for a few pithy epigrams and quotations history is philosophy teaching by examples '' and be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave therefore do not take lightly the perils of war '' when the peloponnesian war broke out he is thought to have been about 28 or 29 years old and rose to the rank of general before being exiled for his military failure at the battle of amphilpolis in those days military failure was counted a crime this book is a meticulous chronicle of the disastrous war until this work historians simply recorded events but his was different an attempt to find inside information from people on both sides and to interpret some of the turning points of the whole war and some of the terrible decisions that ultimately changed history there will always be squabbles about different translations and versions of a classic text but this one is as good as they come and well worth looking at for its insights into some of the events that fashioned our world
thucydides ' the history of the peloponnesian war '' is a wonderful source for any thoughtful study of ancient greek history i 'm proud to put this copy on my book shelf next to homer herodotus and catullus all my favorite ancient writers thucydides writes for what is the first time an objective historical work this along with herodotus is the birth of history yet there are a couple of troubling problems with the translation for one thing it is full of cold war lingo that makes it hard not to draw connections from athens and sparta to the united states and the ussr phrases like reactionary elements '' are out of place and do n't mesh well with the actual greek in addition the translator uses the word empire '' for the greek word arche '' now my greek is n't the best but my dictionary tells me that arche means province or territory or literally a place that is ruled over empire has a lot of strong emotions attached to it and its not a good translation for arche '' hence the translator adds an element that thucydides did n't intend when he uses athenian empire '' besides those elements it 's a great translation
few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece this is one of them thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native athens is remarkable for it 's candor despite events that must have been tragically painful the text includes legendary personalities pericles alcibiades demosthenes nicias etc their actions words and fate facts license readers to decide what 's important and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity who would have thought the promise of persian defeat told by herodotus would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved athens ' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic given recent attempts to democratize the middle east melos destiny at athens ' hands may give pause as may the syracuse expedition especially book seven i read warner 's translation thirty years ago it was then and still turn to it from time to time also recommended landmark thucydides ' robert strassler victor davis hanson this is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes
i first discovered sean steward in perfect circle which is his best book to date in my opinion this one comes close though in this book like perfect circle stewart writes in a way that is very readable and occasionally drops in such clever and phrases and sentences that i actually stepped back and appreciated the writing skill as well as the story that is not to say that you lose your immersion in the story and it is not to say that he is wordy or pretentious just the opposite it is prose that is a delight to read the story is interesting but it is the characters that will drive you to the end that is stewart 's strength he writes people you are interested in knowing more about in a nutshell i 'd recommend perfect circle and mockingbird as a pair great reading
go to the look inside the book '' function above and click on excerpt '' that takes you to the first page of sean stewart 's mockingbird you can also get there through the intro pages '' links read the first paragraph if you 're hooked like i was you 'll love this book like me you may instantly flip to the bio to check the author 's gender sean sean is n't that a guy 's name and is he really writing from the perspective of a woman who the book 's first sentence makes plain gets pregnant in the course of the story yep and most of the other main characters are women too this is a act and boy does stewart pull it off i found his characters and their situation very believable and he writes with style and humor that 's richer than wit or cleverness i ca n't say i 'm surprised by any of that except the thing what brought me to mockingbird is of all things stewart 's entry into franchise fiction his book yoda dark rendezvous a star wars novel set very shortly before the upcoming movie episode iii revenge of the sith '' i 've read dozens of star wars novels and this is one of my two or three favorites again for how stewart fleshes out characters ' inner lives and for the color in his writing the book feels like he had a time writing it i 'm going on about it at length here to bring it to the attention of stewart fans who might not otherwise try a star wars novel if you saw in 2002 and plan to see try it out you do n't need any more background than that and it 'll enhance your enjoyment of yoda count dooku and the movies ' other characters
this book is top notch the character development is fantastic and the story so real that it turns into a roller coaster of emotions top notch
i really enjoyed this book zombie frogs voodoo riders and all the perils and tribulations possible while being pregnant when i was n't pregnant yet after getting pregnant though man it 's funny and it 's really obvious that the man did some real research into the problems mockingbird is more easy going than some of stewart 's other books warmer funnier and much more involved with the everyday things that go with someone 's life with all the complexities absurdities and joy that goes with it it still has that touch of magic he brings to everything and i highly recommend it

this is a great introduction to economics that ranks up there with hayek 's road to serfdom ''
this book is usually listed by advocates as one of the five books to read first henry hazlitt writes with unequaled clarity he outlines that basics of many fundamental ideas the price system inflation government subsidies minimum wage and others he uses pure logic and reasoning almost exclusively only providing statistics as sidenotes to the main point however the book 's strength is also its weakness while he makes a tremendous intellectual defense of free market economics it by no means complete i would recommend this to any beginning libertarian or free market advocate it will provide many strong points for further contemplation and research however a keynesian advocate will still be able to question certain ideas yet any intellectually honest statist should read it because hazlitt does present his arguments cogently clearly and with power one note a more seasoned free market economist may wish to consider this book a medium priority because it may be somewhat basic to someone familiar with classic arguments
this book offers a very clear description of a subject that most people find dry and boring instead of referring to countless graphs and charts hazlitt manages to explain his assertations using common sense and language that a can easily understand this is that same format of the monthly newsletter 'ideas on liberty ' published by the foundation for economic education which aims to improve the understanding of economics among laypeople the foundation has long been a supporter of hazlitt one interesting thing to note is that hazlitt was not formally trained as an economist and i believe that 's one of the reasons that he is able to state all these concepts succintly with no confusion even more amazing is that the same policies that he speaks against and that have failed are being tried again with nothing more that a different name and some other minor changes for those who think economics has to be confusing i wholeheartedly recommend this book
i do n't go into the plots of books when i review them as many have already done so i always look forward to another james lee burke novel and pegasus descending does not disappoint dave robicheaux is one of my favorite protagonists a man who is not perfect has his weaknesses but always tries to do the right thing i highly recommend the dave robicheaux series
one of the best writers of environment and character descriptions burke just gets better and better to the point that i can smell the air after a rain storm in new iberia thanks to the way he puts it colors in his landscapes come to life in my mind 's eye as though i were there i 've read nearly all of burke 's work pegasus ranks among the best
i loved it recently took a trip to new orleans and a side trip to new iberia to see the area he so fondly writes about
no one paints a better picture of south lousiana than james lee burke jlb creates a wonderful canvas of louisana politics wildneress and attitudues i am a michigan native that now lives in south lousiana and have fallen in love with every book he writes this book like every other robicheaux novel has left me starving for more do n't you love books that you hate to finish
as near as i can determine i have read everything by james lee burke that is in print though his prose continues to captivate me his latest novel is not one of my favorites i am confused about how both dave and cletus are portrayed and dave 's relationship with his latest wife also baffles me i plan to reread this book after some time has passed as is my custom with all of burke 's books and see if the problems i think are there have been resolved by some subconscious mental wanderings in the interim
i always know what to expect from burke and his protagonist dave robichaux i am occasionally disappointed by the plot sameness of it but the quality is always there dependable yes i suppose that is the very best description of both author and character i will unquestionably buy the next dave robichaux book burke writes and the one after that and the one after that and will probably complain about the book 's similarities to its predecessors but i will certainly enjoy catching up with my old friend dave
i have read virtually all of james lee burke 's novels and this one is right up there with the best of them highly recommended
james lee burke ! anything written by him is a joy to read but i especially love his robicheaux novels this one is no exception i anxiously await his future novels his writing is pure poetry i recommend all of his books try to read the robicheaux novels in order you wo n't be sorry for the money or time spent on burke 's books
this book is for lovers of robicheaux his demons seem put to rest redemption seems almost within his grasp and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages the poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade burke 's prose as always but his anger at humanity 's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface hurricane katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing a bit like robicheaux himsel
a highly recommended book an amazing and interesting information is revealed here learn how to grow to master the game and to think like the millionaire this book is helpful and comprehensive try to follow it you might start a new life
of all of the self how to prosper books i have ever read eker 's should have been the first it is the quintessential foundation of prosparity
i bought this audio cd looking for that one new concept that changes the way i think about in general i found many more than one plus i 've listened to it 3 times in the two days i had it audio cds are great for that ! if your looking for business ideas or investment advice you 're not really going to get it here i did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means as an investor one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property a great real estate investment book the is weekend millionaire 's guide to real estate investing and the mindset book amazing books ! he talks about the mindset you have to have to take the actions despite of your fears futhermore he elaborates on the following your thoughts determine your feelings and your feelings determine what you do doing translates your desires visualizations etc into reality the biggest thing i got out of this book is the following warning i already know that '' is what most people especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and do n't further educate themselves in a topic rich people are always learning and applying what they learn if you have read books on money investing whatever you want in life and you do n't have the results you want its two things one you 're mindset is not right for that task and you do n't understand what those books were saying if you did understand you would be taking all the actions spelled out and like science your life would reflect them cause and effect notice how i said you and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation great book add to cart !
loved the book so much now my husband and i are going to his 3 day seminar
eker has to be respected for his transformed mind has to go before the transformed bank account but my personal preference is the exhaustive and more systematic presentations that brain tracy makes eker is probably a very motivating speaker ! having said that he gets 4 stars because it is a classic it needs to be in every millionare library
i received this book the next day and i tell you i could not put it down it is the most inspiring the most intriquing book i have ever read great job on the book
exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago i also attended the guerilla business school a 2500 intensive what is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually as it did with me shift your perspective if you are at all open to having it shifted getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones this book may help you but the seminar will help you more the millionaire mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me i am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called zerodollarmarketer dot com being rich is a matter of perspective true wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind my relationships and lastly my pocketbook but its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month a journey worth pursuing
i can not claim to be an expert in the wealth creation literature outside the us but i am inclined to think that the principles are the same everywhere what is so unique about the us is that the system allows the distribution of knowledge in a manner more efficient than the distribution of wealth all based on the principle of self determination and achievement another reason that americans also lead the way in enterpreunarialship is because of the pragmatism they assume on psychological issues pragmatism based on the fundamental the truth is utility so no elaborated theories of the mind just pragmatic analogies that will guide you through i fully agree with a reader who if you keep on studying how to get rich material for 50 years your expertice will be in that but not in yet you can not achive action unless your know your mind will be there helping you yes your mind can be your greatest obstacle to wealth no matter if you work your finger to the bone night and day amd herv helps you to do this i must say this has been a most promising complement to the series for it goes into the inner structure of the mind that rich dad had to the cynic who asks are you a millionare already no but im on my and that a hell of a lot i can say compared to where i was last year
this excellent book deals mostly with the many ways in which nafta is ruining all the countries involved although the description of the problem seems fairly accurate the book disappoints somewhat by not mentioning some stronger cures the strongest and most corrective of which is socialism
i suspect that many americans might be intimidated by the title of this book americans are told not to think in terms of conflicting class interests after all most people are supposedly middle class critiques of the wealthy and powerful are seen as expressions of envy or of antique stalinist hippy or new deal thinking in my opinion jeff faux does us all a valuable service by trying to revive the debate about the political nature of our world and its implications for our current lives and for our future his writing is energetic and fresh this is no dull social science text ! at the same time he presents a lot of evidence in making his arguments reflecting thorough and careful scholarship this is no simple partisan account for example chapter seven on nafta presents is in its critique of the alleged benefits of free trade but the reader gets the feeling that faux is basing his analysis on what his data revealed about its complex impacts on the majority of americans canadians and mexicans overall whether you are in america or armenia you will be entertained and provoked by faux 's writing
the title appears borrowed from sam marcy 's original work in 1979 on the global class war and the destiny of american labor '' but then no one wanted to listen in the 1970 's when i did my first master 's degree to the three major themes in the political science literature 1 limits to growth and need for ecological economics club of rome herman daly 2 global reach of multinational corporations and the country issues and threats to domestic labor and social welfare barnett 3 need for world government to address global issues falk this book is valuable for its one main point reiterated and documented over and over again the american elite has joined with other elites to reach accommodations that favor the investors and the ruling elites over the individuals that are employees if i had not also read william greider 's the soul of capitalism '' as well as john perkins confessions of an economic hit man '' and over two decades ago lionel tiger the manufacture of evil '' i might have seen this book in a different light in the larger context of the books i have reviewed at amazon this book sums up a key factor that the public must consider when going to elect its leaders over the next few years as the author documents and discusses the combination of neoliberalism and has led to government being in the service of corporations and the wealthy rather than the public and especially the working public the author suggests citing another author that the working class is 62 of america the middle class 36 and the ruling class 2 he also notes that america is no longer a mobile society with 77 of the people stuck '' in their parent 's rut and with wages now back to where they were in the 1970 's in other words no real gains in quality of life or purchasing power across the land the author spends a great deal of time on nafta and his views are all negative he is passionate on the topic of mexico being a bomb waiting to explode and on how nafta and the deliberate tolerance of illegal immigration have essentially served as a pressure value where the us imports poverty from mexico in order to keep it from a worse explosion the author is quite provocative when he examines the rescue '' of mexico by secretary of the treasury rubin he follows the money '' and discovers that the taxpayer did not bail out mexico per se but rather goldman sachs and all the other investors in mexico investors who were supposed to evaluate risk and take risk and accept the consequences but instead used their goldman sachs brother in arms to bail them out at taxpayer expense today of course president bush has just appointed another goldman sachs leader to be secretary of the treasury after the more honest paul o'neil resigned when he discovered that vice president dick cheney was making all the policies without regard to the cabinet process see my review of the price of loyalty '' the author is compelling in discussing how the reagan revolution broke the backs of the labor unions and also broke up the postwar social safety nets the author discusses how there is no corporate that puts the home country the usa first he discusses at length how we are coming off decades during which multinational corporations aided and abetted by their class collaborators in government and the media have essentially broken the social contracts with each country 's public and disconnected their global investments from any social benefit for labor the author is very illuminating when he points out that it is not china that is flooding the us with cheap goods but rather and wall street investing us dollars in china to leverage chinese labor while jobs and driving both salaries and quality down across the board within the usa where has been proven to destroy small businesses for miles around any one of its main stores see my review of both the dvd and the book the author is an optimist and an idealist and i will end my review with a quote that i hope a future enlightened president will support the author says on page 246 '' to this end a conference or congress of north american civil society state and local officials and representatives of labor and small businesses should be held every year one of its functions would be to do a public review of the state of continental integration and to discuss debate and make proposals for the future '' i am reminded of falk 's genius in knowing in the 1970 's that we would one day need global council for both religions and peoples government has failed to be just or to represent the public this book comes at a good time in america november 2006 is a necessary to electoral reform and getting an honest wise president and a coalition cabinet in 2008. to do that enough people have to vote so as to defeat the extremist republican skill at stealing elections that are close it has to be a landslide
a well written book that confirms books i was writing till my power supply blew out in general the author goes over how the shallow rich are oppressing the the world in order to acquire more wealth and maintain it the only problem i found with this book is that the author uses complicated and hard to understand setences sometimes which no doubt he does to show off his high eduction as a defense against others with a high education in other words to show he is n't just some dumb wanderer off the street but his use of hard sentences hurts his book in that it will make it harder for younger persons to undersand and people who do n't understand some of the uncommon terminology he uses
from a george bush perspective i read hence i must be a revolutionary but for me reading is essentail in rafael 's book scaramouche '' the establishment games the system by dueling the people 's representatives with their skillfully commissioned swords they literally kill the people 's will today 's fait accomplis are the skillfully commissioned penned instruments called nafta and wto the perpetrators behind these instruments were a political crew of bloodsuckers on the american side they included robert rubin bill clinton alan greenspan lawrence summers al gore and henry kissinger these penned agreements were inserted with poison pills designed to adversely effect constitutiions throughout the world including ours but you 'll never hear a discouraging word about them from the corporate mainsteam news get the real down and dirty of globalization and read the global class war '' read it and weep for those you had placed your trust in and to the republic they signed off on learn to distinguish between the interests of stateless transnationals and we the people whose economic fate is bounded by the nation the poor class has already lost what little they had now the middle class is in the cross hairs and slowly being squeezed out unfortunately they have taken us all aboard their hellbound corporate express called the bottom line a must read for those who want the truth
faux has done a really smashing job in bringing many threads into a coherent picture the witless rightwing reviewer who invoked hayek von mises wretched wonks of the right and economic darwinists all did not even know what book he was reviewing typical of the right the idea of transnational elites who screw their own countrymen is not new the way in faux ties this to comtemporary economics social movements and politics is different and far more perusuading than the usual the aliens have taken over the elites '' junk available today the us has built its own pit and still does not know when to stop digging the corporations built a massive megaphone for the right and scared the left to death with threats fear is the currency of the day in any discussion about the future we have a bunch of sheep in the congress and confused frightened polity which is seized with the distractors which have been provided religion abortion immigration homosexuality all bunk above all faux point about the diminishing corporate investment in the us in research development education health etc is a clear sign that the use of the transnationals if over if but for the current era they have tolerated the insanity of the bush regime since they dont really care even if the us creates illegal and immoral wars which again distract us while the corporations go on about their business the us has been under assault by the corporations for some 40 or so years and has now bought out the infrastructure designed to stop this massive taking of ecomonic and legal power the price of our stupidity and cupidity in taking our eye off the real wolf is our being devoured
explaining their own economic to redneck republicans is a bit easier than explaining geometry to gophers all it takes is infinite time and patience this book makes a valiant attempt to educate redneck republicans
i find this book just a bit disjointed its main thesis seems to be that the fafta agreements were basically a fraud perpetrated upon the american worker by a global elite faux sees a class war going on with this global elite who he calls the 'party of davos ' from the town of davos switzerland where a conference is held each year operating to their own benefit to the harm of the american worker the question he does n't answer is if nafta is taking away all these american jobs why is the unemployment rate in the us so low i even saw a sigh across town that mcdonalds was paying 10 an hour in an attempt to get more people second i worked for a company that did a lot of design work in taiwan it was a chinese company and they had a team of chinese engineers they did good work buying a computer motherboard from them was about half of buying one made in the us would you really be willing to pay twice as much for your pc just to have it made in the us the product would be no better just made here and does n't the chinese engineer bright educated hard working deserve a future as well finally faux ignoring china india and the rest of the developing countries says that he would like to see an expansion of the north american treaties to perhaps even have canada and mexico join the us in one country i 've never met a canadian who wanted to join the us this is an interesting book worth reading just to get his point of view but i 'm afraid that i do n't see what he wants happening very soon
according to jeff faux erstwhile president of the economic policy institute in washington dc with the enfeebled and the absence of world government the plus people who manage and own the worlds largest multinational corporations meet every year at the world economic forum in davos switzerland to set the agenda for the global economy even though the event includes political leaders academics journalists and an occasional movie star they are mere window dressing accompanying the real movers and shakers this elite is what faux calls the party of davos '' there is no countervailing party other than the world social forum which celebrates the likes of hugo chavez and fidel castro but they are of no consequence in the real order of things the party of davos is primarily the party of international global investors who do their best to promote globalization and free trade elites around the world have bought into it including the leadership of both the democratic and rebublican parties in the us with the expectation that globalization would raise all economic boats or so they would have us believe however this has not happened faux correctly points out that prior to the age of globalization the us economy was more or less and capital and labor were forced to deal with each other thereby creating a social contract from which all parties benefited what was once good for gm was also good for america now it is only good for gm this may not be a good example since even the global investor is not happy with gm the point being that gm can now find cheaper labor and lower environmental standards in other countries faux argues persuasively that globalization went astray with the nafta agreement which was supposed to protect workers and the environment in the us mexico and canada instead thanks to the clinton administration multinational corporations were given a free hand in overriding those very protections it 's almost as if ross perot 's giant sucking sound '' pulling jobs out of the us has been realized moreover ten years and a wto later that giant sucking sound is pulling those jobs out of the entire nafta block and ending up in china and india the result is that workers ' wages and living standards from all three nafta countries have declined under free trade '' again faux reminds us that rich countries have poor people and poor countries have rich people the rich or the investor class in all countries have prospered whereas the and the poor have seen their fortunes decline to compound this problem the us trade deficit was 726 billion last year and there is no evidence that it will decline in the future our manufacturing base is being hollowed out and the knowledge economy is being outsourced the primary job creation since the year 2000 has been in healthcare government finace and the service sector if this trend continues it will become impossible to export our way out of this deficit unless there is a significant devaluation of the dollar which will inevitably lower our standard of living this is going to happen no matter what policy is adopted in the near future it is only a question of how much of a less prosperous future we will have pat buchanan in a recent article entitled our hollow prosperity '' makes the same argument as faux and indeed cites statistics from the economic policy institute buchanan does not couch the argument in terms of class struggle my main quibble with faux 's thesis but he does believe when corporations are given the oppurtunity to find cheaper labor abroad they will do so and that the current free trade policy is undermining our prosperity with the left and the right finding common cause against the corporate and political elite there should be a significant political realignment when the next economic downturn hits what does faux recommend he is calling for a new global or at least a regional social contract it looks something like managed trade let 's face it the economies that are running a surplus with us are practising managed trade we should start bargaining for greater access to their markets and place a higher bar of entry to ours faux is not advocating protectionism just smart policy instead of none at all we can now see the trajectory of globalization thomas friedman proclaimed that it created a global and level playing field in the job market for workers heretofore excluded clyde prestowitz proclaimed that the playing field was tilted against the industrialized world because our high wage requirements put us at a disadvantage now jeff faux is saying that all workers are being sold short and that it 's time to create a global social contract who says there is no such thing as progress
for a dog behaviour professional this book and its companion volume have to be the most useful and important resource around not for the casual dog owner but then that 's not the target market a wealth of material well presented and organised and without bias now when 's the one on behaviour modification coming out ! !
i would give this book five stars if it were n't for the level of difficulty in reading it just had to take off a star for that reason alone this is n't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer it 's a serious book for the student of dog behavior and training lindsay definitely knows what he 's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the concepts '' behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material it was a good read that i had trouble putting down though ! if you 're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training the book is well laid out and informative to the max
absolutely amazing full of clear and detailed information much of which i had previously not known or failed to appreciate its significance and relevance even a professional could benefit
i wish someone could have given me this book when my daughter was born in june 2005. i had a hard time finding information that deals with specific issues relating to babies with down syndrome

jean shepard contributed to our culture with the stories that resulted in a christmas story '' he 's hard to dislike for that work alone here though you get more exposure to jean 's other side he is cynical and not all that charming about it he stereotypes and it reminds us of how we used to be about assuming traits in people based on their race or ethnic origin he excuses a lot of pretty bad behavior and worse expects us to agree with him that it is cute well that 's the bad stuff the good stuff is that he still has a grasp of american rhythym that 's hard to find most places you will enjoy his fresh view of our experiences and if you overlook your potential reactions like the foregoing paragraph describes you 'll hear an authentic descriptive voice which is now gone

boulder colorado author margaret coel calls the wolf a wonderful animal it 's always two looks ahead '' of everybody else she says using the wolf as metaphor she gets the villain in her mystery novel the eye of the wolf at least two looks ahead of both readers and main characters the in her series featuring the boston irish priest father john o'malley and arapaho lawyer vicky holden as the crime solvers the eye of the wolf takes the reader to the wind river reservation in wyoming there traditional enemies the arapaho and shoshone share the land father john serves an arapaho parish vicky works with an arapaho law firm the two are close friends as eye of the wolf opens someone has killed three shoshone college students on the bates battlefield where in 1874 shoshone scouts led the united states cavalry to an arapaho village the soldiers slaughtered everyone living there animosity between the shoshone and arapaho two very different peoples with diverse cultures has smoldered since father john fears the worst when he sees the latest bodies at bates all posed like dead warriors in old photographs someone wants to encourage the hatred why and who he his parishioners and the police suspect frankie montana this arapaho trouble has often fought with shoshones in bars because he drifts around the reservation drinking and crashing at drug houses most decent people of both groups despise frankie his mother lucille begs vicky to become frankie 's lawyer lucille believes he 's innocent because lucille is a friend vicky agrees to take the case however she too believes frankie is guilty he concern is to get him a fair trial frankie asserts he did not commit the crime but will not talk to vicky or the police as he eludes them out of sheer terror of jail father john finds a fourth shoshone victim at bates looking at the evidence against frankie vicky begins think he may not be the killer so does father john after talking to people in the parish but then who is can father john and vicky find the person and prove his or her identify to the police or is the murderer like the wolf two looks ahead will that give him or her time to kill again worse have father john and vicky made a mistake to believe frankie is he really the killer will he prove it by shooting one of them their gamble on frankie brings eye of the wolf to an end that one one could possibly expect but the conclusion makes perfect sense because margaret coel writes with understanding of arapaho and shoshone history through that history she reveals the killer also through that history she also makes eye of the wolf more than just another mystery with an explosive ending as the story unfolds she presents two native american groups that get little attention from novelists working closely with people who live on wind river reservation she makes sure her depiction is accurate so eye of the wolf is not something like or just like a wolf it is a wolf two looks ahead of everybody readers will not only enjoy a gripping mystery but they 'll also learn something about other people and their lives they 'll receive the lesson through rich and belleville characters quirky little subplots lively dialogue and solid description of locale
margaret coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the wind river reservation in wyoming and describes the arapahoe customs in wonderful detail in this installment father o'malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the arapahoe and shoshone indians has been and that dead indians can be found on an ancient battle ground when father o'malley goes to investigate he discovers three dead shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles things heat up when the young shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends vicky holden the other main character in the series has entered into a law partnership with adam lone eagle and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling vicky wants to defend frankie montana who is a suspect in the murders and adam tries to persuade her not to take frankie as a client as always author coel creates a wonderful setting and characters and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series
it is hard to believe that margaret coel began her wind river reservation series some ten years ago with the eagle catcher which introduced readers to father john o'malley and defense attorney vicky holden each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between o'malley and holden the latest installment in this series is no exception eye of the wolf begins with a cryptic telephone message that is left for o'malley on an answering machine this leads him to the site of a historic battlefield one that resulted in the slaughter of an arapaho indian village by forces aided by shoshone scouts in modern times arapahos and shoshones are somewhat uneasy neighbors on the wind river reservation with their antagonistic history providing a shadowy backdrop gone but not entirely forgotten but past differences are brought to the forefront when o'malley discovers the bodies of three shoshones on the old battlefield positioned to mimic those of the dead killed in the historic battle frankie montana a chronic client of holden 's is the primary suspect despite montana 's recidivistic tendencies holden does not believe he is capable of murder it eventually becomes clear to holden and o'malley that someone is attempting to revive the conflict between the arapahos and shoshones and that holden has placed herself in terrible danger on behalf of her client while coel has created an extensive backstory contributing to the wind river reservation mythos it is not necessary to read what has transpired before eye of the wolf the tension between o'malley and holden builds from page to page as they struggle to protect the innocent and each other from an unknown malefactor at the same time both are protective of o'malley 's priestly vows even as their emotions practically but subtly beg for violation eye of the wolf is an excellent introduction to the wind river reservation series while providing a welcome return to the area and its people for longtime followers of the series given the longevity of these novels it is clear that coel can continue to explore this beautiful dangerous landscape for as long as she wishes recommended reviewed by joe hartlau
the poetic macabre message shakes up father john o'malley the jesuit pastor at francis on the wind river plantation the caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths not long afterward at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the shoshone betrayed the arapaho to the cavalry three shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here frankie montana who was seen recently arguing with the shoshone and has quite a rap sheet is charged with the triple homicides his lawyer vicky holden believes frankie who insists he is innocent because she knows this low life would do just about anything but not murder as she mounts a defense she wonders if the culprit is cunningly trying to cause an indian war between the two tribes for some unknown reason or a psychopath is avenging the century plus slaughter the latest wind river reservation mystery eye of the wolf is a fabulous legal thriller that uses brutal late nineteenth century carnage as the apparent motive to century murders the story line moves out rather quickly when father o'malley listens to the high pitched poetry of the killer on his voice machine and never takes a breather as vicky tries to prove her client did not commit the crime though circumstantially he appears heading for the fall margaret coel is at her best with this tale that affirms why so many readers feel she is the heir apparent to the hillerman mantle harriet klausner
eye of the wolf by margaret coel isbn 0425205460 due out today 6 september 2005 i was sent an arc of this great book to read for review which i do gladly i had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them especially spirit woman and story teller so was expecting good things i was not disappointed the series follows the adventures of father john o'malley pastor of francis mission on the wind river reservation and tribal attorney vicki holden and apart from a ripping good mystery the author weaves the history of the arapho and the soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life it is not hard to care about the indian priest '' as they call father john or vicky holden i think what i enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well they were brought vividly alive by the author 's words from the first mystery message this is for the indian priest '' everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield but does it this is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish
carole radziwill 's memoir is an exquisite description of loving relationships family expectations and maintaining a marriage with constant threat of terminal illness the book is written in a the tragic story of her husband 's recurrent cancer unfolds carole never resorts to hyperbole interconnected themes are deftly strung together like pearls anthony radziwill did not want others to know of his illness and the weight of maintaining a pretense that all was well increased with each bad his deteriorating prognosis and certain death was never openly discussed although his cousin john kennedy tried to push carole into doing so what remains is a wonderful testament to anthony radziwill and john and carolyn kennedy not because of what carole radziwill tells us but because of how she tells their story radziwill 's sentences shimmer and dance and wrap themselves around the reader her use of language is so masterful that the names become mere background to the story of four young people whose hopes and dreams ended nearly as soon as they began this book is beautifully written
i have read quite a few memoirs lately the tender bar the year of magical thinking million little memoir and by far this was the best one i read i love carole radziwell 's writing style and i found her story to be gutsy emotional and truthful as a person who watched a loved one die of cancer before my eyes i could totally relate to her feelings of frustration helplessness and sadness i can say their is nothing on earth worse than watching a love on deteriorate before your eyes and not able to save them i had no idea of the relationship between her and the kennedy family so i was very intrigued by her personal view of the family and the friendship i felt she wrote this book with great respect for her husbands family revealing what she deemed approriate written with integrity this was a magnificent first book and i look forward to reading more of her work i highly recommend this book
just as i said in the title this is an amazing look at love and death and being in the spotlight when you enter that inner circle of the famous or society not the infamous not the instant celebs but the inner circle of names that make america what it is carole radziwill married john john 's '' cousin son of lee radziwell jackie o 's sister and because of this she entered the inner kennedy circle and coincidentally became one of carolyn john 's wife best friends fascinating stuff here i think many of us assumed that carolyn and carole were both upper class they appear to have been middle class and even worked at the same department store in nyc at one time where they had to wear yellow aprons of course carolyn worked in cosmetics dept and carole worked in customer service the fascinating part of this book is that carole is able to somehow view both the yin and yang of her marriage and the relationship with the kennedy family especially john and carolyn carole 's husband gets cancer and is actually dying the week that john and carolyn 's plane crashes carole is the one who has to notify the coasts guard and carolyn 's family 's a great book to read to show that you can be happy and sad at the same time i appreciate her honesty she signed up for love and roses and got death and dying much of the time now it 's time for her to get her own life again a former news researcher she spent much of her married life taking care of a sick dying husband and then dealing with the kennedy tragedy too fascinating
those of us who have a story to share should do so and this story is beautifully written what remains is a unique one worth telling and would be even if it did not involve america 's single most famous family the details carole radziwill reveals are intimate yet never give away more than those connected and still living would find intrusive at times her pain is almost palpable and she seems still slightly bewildered about her life and the tragic turn it took during the summer of 1999. the very fact that she did live it and came through it gives her every right to tell about it and i am glad she chose to do so
this is not the memoir of carole radziwill it is a memoir for each person who reads the moving story you will find yourself comparing the scenes in this work with comparable things that have happened in your life and the lives of your family friends you perhaps will find yourself viewing those captured in the tabloids in a little different light but most importantly you will understand it is those little '' things that makes life worth living and leaves the memories that are timeless
i just finished the book last night crying as i read the last few pages i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press she was a delightful and woman filled with life which makes her ending even more tragic the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde
if anyone in this most famous dynasty has earned this title she would be the one congrat 's to anthony john and carolyn for recognizing true class as it is a rarity it speaks volumes about them ! ! carole 's courage and capacity to love will amaze her talent is another thing entirely off the charts ! ! ! put aside some quiet time and a lot of kleenex !
i really enjoyed this book this is a memoir not a novel which explains why reading it felt like reading a journal i loved carole 's style of writing and the way she portrayed things i think she wanted this to be just a story of friends and not focus on who the friends were i think she accomplished this it did not feel like just another book about the kennedy family even though i knew how the book would end i cried it was written so beautifully
this book provides a good overview of venture capital and buyout fund management it addresses the investment process through four modules fundraising investing exiting and new frontiers there are twenty nine chapters of which nine are instructional and the rest are case studies though there is information interspersed within the case studies i think it would have been better to have had shorter case studies and longer instructional pieces to delve more deeply into subjects
a must for anyone wanting to know how vc firms work structure themselves and considerations for funding this is an excellent case study that ought to be in a graduate program ! it 's as close as you 'll get without working for a vc firm i would suggest reading the venture capital cycle '' first to get a general feel for vc and how it works then read the case study
want examples of how funding works want to know how venture firms set up their business want to know everything about practical application of vc firms this may be as close as you 'll get without actually working in one this ought to be a text book in graduate school i 'd suggest the venture capital cycle '' as the first book to get an overview of vc 's then read this one and you 'll be pretty proficient in terms of being an outsider great case study
let 's be clear what we 're buying here an authoritative text on how to deploy character crescendo climax and theme in the idiom of the dramatic novel frey is covering the big picture how skilled writers nurture the evolution of tensions through the work as a whole his references to the classic canon of american fiction reinforce the message that these techniques are the essence of drama and not just the stock in trade of pulp fiction understand however that frey 's book is not a complete manual for the novelist or meant to be one if it 's the of that you 're interested in dialogue pacing points of view there 'll be another book to buy frey bundles them into the final pages of how to write a damn good novel '' and they read like an afterthought
how to write a damn good novel is billed as a no nonsense guide to dramatic storytelling '' i do n't know about the part but frey 's advice is definately and will help you create dynamic stories i sat down to read this book with a packet of notes by my side i marked all the important points i thought i 'd need to remember for later at the end i had a thick rainbow along the spine i could n't get more than 3 pages without finding some gem i just had to make sure not to forget i think a lot of the other reviewers might be correct when they say this advice is not necessarily earth shattering and can be found else where but there is a difference frey does it with more clarity more punch and why buy six writing books to get all the advice you can get in this one i ca n't go wrong with this one even though i did n't agree with some of his advice i still found his guide inspired me to write better and make my character sizzle i have a lot of writing guides on my bookshelf but this is one of my favorites
this book has broken down all the elements that make a book a page turner and a financial success ! although i have read other books on the subject of writing i felt this one was much more practical and was broken down to the point where anyone could understand it i highly recommend this not just for new writers but also for those experienced writers who need help on a specific aspect of their writing you 'll find it worth the price
if your learning style is to learn a formula then expand from there then this is the perfect approach for you let me be clear if you are a beginner learning the craft then this is a good place to start one of the two best books on novel writing in my opinion but this book will work for you only if you are best served by learning a basic formula first then building upon it and venturing into the unknown or breaking the rules here 's another way to look at it some people can learn to drive a stick shift and traffic rules at the same time others do better with an automatic transmission allowing them to concentrate on learning traffic rules in a vehicle that shifts by itself a formula then later learning to use a manual transmission if you are in this latter category someone who learns better by first mastering the path then this is the best book to get you started
this is one of the best books i 've read on writing and i 've read lots i was amazed every chapter was important and significant
how to write a damn good novel is a very good book on the subject it is all inclusive well written and to the point the outline permits the reader to understand how to proceed and because of a few very fine examples to feel that it is possible something i learned from this book that is not necessarily in others is the idea of developing a compelling premise before engaging in the long process of writing a novel the book is brief and could rank above the many books trying to help the writer with too many words
this book is full of the best advice i have ever read for new writers which is what i am or hope to be
i 'm a junior in college and my parents bought this cookbook for me as a gift for my first apartment my experience with cooking has n't really gone past heating up chicken cutlets in the oven so i was a little wary of using an actual cookbook but this book is really useful the recipes are varied snacks '' meals desserts healthier cooking etc and there are also a lot of tips that can help out new cooks be applied to other recipes or adjust the ones already in the book for less ingredients or quicker preparation a couple examples muffins do n't have buttermilk add 1 tablespoon lemon juice to 1 cup regular milk and let it sit for a minute before adding the egg '' chicken with noodles to serve the basic sauce in this recipe with other foods leave out the frozen spinach and experiment with a different combination of seasonings such as cayenne pepper or a hot sauce for seafood '' honey garlic spareribs do n't have a grill the ribs can also be baked gives instructions baste the spareribs frequently with the honey garlic marinade during the final 30 minutes of cooking '' in addition the book provides helpful advice on food safety how to store leftovers and cooking terms 'simmer ' i know but 'blanch ' and 'dredge ' were helpful to have explained some people with more experience in the kitchen might find a lot of this book a little too basic but i appreciate having instructions on how to an egg or to remember to leave a of potato pulp inside the skin when making stuffed potatoes so that the whole thing does n't fall apart i agree with the previous reviewer that this book is by no means for anyone living in a dorm though it claims to be maybe some colleges have dorm kitchens and grocery stores right near campus but this book is definitely better for a student living in an apartment with a kitchen storage space and time to make actual meals there are definitely certain things about this book that some would consider drawbacks but for a real with a kitchen like myself this book is perfect
has written a highly enjoyable book about the nature of science that reads quickly and easily i strongly recommend this book for anyone involved with teaching science that may be a professor secondary or elementary school teacher the author takes the best most sober points from philosophers historians and sociologists of science and demonstrates the implications these works have for preparing a scientifically literate public he clarifies troublesome definitions such as theory '' fact '' proof '' and hypothesis '' his insights on falsification and the need for an understanding of statistics are i am using this book in the courses i teach why only four stars first in his scientists ' vignettes where he uses biographical information on a scientist to illustrate a are a rather homogenous bunch for true excellence i would have to see more diverse group of scientists discussed secondly his understanding of science as a discourse is somewhat impoverished and i would say that his treatment of the topic is n't completely fair this should not take away from a strong recommendation great book
in this discerning and somewhat humorous essay virginia woolf remarks on humanity 's experiences with illness whether mental or physical and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art she notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world hermione lee 's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of woolf 's life and writing this paris press edition recreates the original artwork and typeset of the 1930 printing of on being ill ''
i 'm married and bought this book for some ideas on what to do while my husband is out of town on business trips or playing weekend warrior i disagree with the last review i think the whole idea for the book we 'll give you the ideas you plan it out is right on after all is n't it supposed to be about getting out of the house and into life nor do i agree with the sentiment that going to town hall meetings are not fun at all '' maybe getting involved with city politics is n't your idea of a good time but what 's one woman 's junk is another woman 's treasure overall a very good read with even better ideas
i love this book and have bought some for gifts for friends and family too ! the authors have created and collected lots of highly innovative ideas and presented them in such a humorous way i have literally laughed out loud '' upon reading most of the chapters when is their next book coming out i ca n't wait
truly a classic and juggernaut effort of bringing together various disparate scientific thoughts into a coherent and fluent theory and more amazingly in a form that is both accessible and entertaining for the layman reader
this book is a somewhat linear history of the past years across the continents diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali yali 's question was why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea but we black people had little cargo of our own '' reading the book i think i gulped at this point this sounds like a classic loaded question it sounds disturbingly close to why have we europe and its former colonies succeeded where they have failed diamond does not descend into that territory though but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely there are references to a culture 's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing for instance the advantages of a culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia this history can probably be described or perhaps is most successful as based around environmental causation as opposed to the causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing descriptions of climate note that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age longitudinal or latitudinal axes elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity still it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title guns europe 's refinement of this technology was based on china 's innovations with gunpowder today 's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated as an interesting counterpoint japan had owned more and better guns in 1600 ce than any country in the world samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology japan would n't resume manufacture until mid century obviously there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry 's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today germs epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who did n't survive smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate interesting note the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease likely smallpox rather than guns steel technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities a culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things first there appears to need to be sustainable farming many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region where today we invade suck oil and force the conquered to endure freedom the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop as a complete side note the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself compared to africa and the americas eurasia is mainly axis versus movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal something like corn maize which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography llamas and guinea pigs which could be useful for pack animals and food never made it north conversely all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle horses pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe to answer yali 's question some of the answer is luck africa australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had some other is environmental determinism where you are helps make up who you become for going forward diamond cites transportation communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future after word harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up but not as fully developed here that of native american discoveries pronouncements knowingly confronting a loaded question in a folio called might white of you are american archaeologists white supremacists '' the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about bce there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive one wonders if the discovery especially all the business about caucusoid '' skulls is n't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide
one the best books on the subject a must read but you need to know your history and geography first if not have a map ready be prepared for a fast and furious ride through time and geography but with constant flashbacks to the present you will not look at the world the same way after finishing this book provided that you have the intellectual capacity and curiousity to read it cover to cover
this is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the human development a must in everyone 's shelves ! ! !
this book is a must read for all social science academics and the like diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others although he is believable his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic
diamond presents a look at the evolution of various cultures throughout the world and how geography has played an important part in their developement the reason that eurasia and north africa evolved more highly developed technologically anyway cultures was that there was a wider variety of wild plant and animal species that could be tamed by the humans living in those areas following the ice age than there was available to humans in other parts of the world this enabled people in these areas to develope farming societies which required more specializations than hunter gatherer societies more quickly than in other parts of the globe the close proximity of animals in this farming societies passed on germs from animal hosts to humans and evolved human resistance to pathogens such as smallpox to survivors of the diseases and their offspring those areas such as the americas without large domesticated animals to catch diseases from were decimated by old world diseases when they were introduced by european explorers the premise of the book could have degenerated into white supremacist or nonsense and the fact that it does n't says a lot about the writing skills of the author one fact that he does n't address is how the freedom of expression is a key factor in the development of societies when that freedom disappears or is suppressed as in the case of 15 c china or 18 c holland society tends to stagnant and decline i would reccomend the book for those interested in history anthropology or sociology
this is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length i want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful engaging and thought provoking story this book packs the punch of great fiction it covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic you certainly do n't need to be a history major biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author jared diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations i think the major shortcoming of his work is that he does n't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history if you do n't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture the need for armies etc you will find this fascinating reading if you have a deep knowledge of these areas anthropology and sociology you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying however most likely you will enjoy the story if you can keep in mind that it does n't provide the full picture in short this book magnificently illuminates jared diamond 's specific areas of interest while downplaying or neglecting others it provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner
i recommend this book to anyone who has come from a dispensational background and is interested in eschatology it is very well written with short chapters that do n't bog the reader down with difficult theological jargon exposes the reader to a historicist typically seventh day adventist interpretation of scriptures that will challenge you to dig deeper into the word of god with a critical eye
this is a must read no matter what you believe ! i 've read quite a few and then some on the end times and this is the best book on the end times and topics it is a read simple and concise filled with scripture to back up evey editorial paragraph no matter what you know do n't know or just always believed this is a must read ! it is topical in writing style which makes it easy to use as a template for comparing with other books except other books on same subject tend to be muddled and ! we are now using as a foundation for further study in a bible study group and have bought 10 books so everyone has their own copy ! this is a book no matter what you believe very compelling and easy to read ! ! !
this is the second book by steve wohlberg that i have book is more comprehensive than truth left '' mr wohlberg 's books are easy 'll state that i do n't agree with everything that he identity of israel in this book is basically replacement theology or the idea of a spiritual israel '' considering that revelation identifies 12 tribes in see also i ca n't see israel being a spiritual of the negative the historicist view is very sensible when considering the source of the preterist and futuristic views of did n't know the history or source of these two theories before reading steve wohlberg 's exposes the flaws in both theories would the church be spared tribulation when countless believers of the past were murdered for their beliefs check out foxe 's book of martyrs '' wohlberg does an excellent job in answering that question and more with the the bible and a knowledge of history and you can learn a lot about the book of revelation ! while i do disagree on one point i recommend this book as an answer to the fiction of the left behind '' series
what a great book i have been studying the bible on these subjects for sometime and was convinced that the the holy scriptures did not teach the commonly held evangelical view of the rapture israel and the antichrist praise god that a voice has been raised to expose these fables and deceptions if you are a sincere bible student i would encourage you to get this book could it have been put together better probably but let not that take away from the truths that are revealed here christians it is high time that we get back to the burean method of bible study acts 17 and not be taken by certain authors just because the local christian bookstore promotes them if we are deceived we have no one to blame but ourselves because truth is out there the question is are we willing to dig for it
interesting eye opener i would have preferred a longer presentation of evidence to sustain it 's conclusions
this is a good introduction for those who are interested in a comprehensive but not review of the historicist view wohlberg covers a lot of ground in 200 pages so he does not look at alternative interpretations of passages or examine potential textual difficulties he simply presents the interpretation as he sees it this is appropriate to the book 's intended audience however which appears to be a popular audience not a scholarly one the book is unfortunately light on what i consider to be the most difficult interpretations namely the trumpets and bowls of revelation but so are most historicist books i 've reviewed recently in terms of style this book is well written wohlberg is however fond of complementing his arguments with elaborate and sensational phrases such as earthshattering '' and bombshell '' which can be repeated several times in a single chapter several times he compares his arguments to the iceberg that sunk the titanic futurism this kind of gets old very quickly and it is irritating and distracting in an otherwise professional presentation the most disturbing aspect of wolberg 's presentation however is that he presents historicism not only as the preferred view but the only interpretation leading to life he regularly ties futurism and preterism to the spirit of antichrist and leading using his own words potentially to hell '' this belief is based on the standard historicist interpretation that the papal system is the antichrist of prophecy and that the school of futurism was invented by and thus is wholly a deception of this system therefore wohlberg suggests that anyone holding the preterist or futurist view is subject to the coming wrath and judgment upon this papal system even to the point of leading individuals to eternal judgment the idea that one 's views in and of themselves could lead to eternal destruction is a disturbing and theologically unsound viewpoint that is woven throughout an otherwise good book in all my criticism are minor this is a book and considering its intended purpose and audience a good introduction to historicism for anyone researching this view nigro author of before god 's wrath the bible 's answer to the timing of the rapture
i havent read the book but i have something to say in response to gregory nyman he said '' scripture makes it very clear that christ lived died on the cross shed his blood for the remission of sins and rose from the dead to justify those who believe in him and as a result receive eternal life jesus also said that those who loved him would follow his commandments and he cited the two greatest commandments as loving god with all our heart soul strength and mind and loving our neighbor as ourselves nowhere does the bible teach that it 's 'christ plus the commandments ' to come to christ is to follow christ plus nothing and christ minus nothing he is our all in all he is the fulfillment of the law to all those who believe '' i understand his stance on the 10 commandments because i have many friends that think like him the problem is people like him dont even believe in the 10 commandments anymore if you do n't thats fine but then why believe the bible at all but for these people its still a sin to lie commit adultry steal murder but its not a sin to break the sabbath following gods laws based one what you feel '' is idiotic if you follow one you should follow them all you can not pick an choose following god 's law isnt legalism making up your own laws to say how good you are is i dont think he said that but thats often an argument people use the sabbath is in the bible it was created by god on the first week of creation and nothing in the bible refutes that i have seen the lame attempts by people to try to use the bible to refute the sabbath and it is lastly like he mentioned that god talked about the 2 greatest commandments he is right but if you break down the 10 commandments they all fall into one of those 2 commandments he isnt somehow changing this laws or standards for us when he mentions this all he is doing is stating the principles behind the commandments love god and love man god forgives and god is great but he does have standards and its dangerous to ignore them im not a perfect person but the logic presented by that reader is fallacious
anthropologist on mars '' begins with a quote by geneticist haldane a quote that so beautifullly sums up the book 's aim as to bear repeating '' the universe is not only queerer than we imagine but queerer than we can imagine '' oliver sacks 's seven paradoxical tales aim at showing us just that we are offered a mere glimpse of the neurological pluriverse and in so witnessing become able to appreciate just how 'queer ' human nature can be other reviewers have gone into great detail about the outline of each story so i will leave that to them what i wish to point out to prospective readers is sack 's ability through his tales to make the ordinary things about our brains that we take for granted appear unique fragile and more special than we might have thought for instance we witness two stories dealing with sight first we explore the case of a painter who loses all sense of color late in life we also see its opposite a blind man given sight late in life in the first case we get a real sense of how integral the sense of color is for life we watch this man describe how the world becomes infinitely duller and less interesting when all one can see is shades of gray he is driven almost to suicide ! in the next tale we see how astonishingly hard it is to 'learn to see ' and all the things the brain must do to achieve this which becomes all the harder the older one is we also meet some folks who are autistic and as such lack the social instincts and abstraction that we who have them take for granted imagine if you can having to learn social rules such things as body language vocal inflection and sense of humor like one would learn algebra not instinctually but intellectually and imagine being mystified by ideas like romantic love and the beauty of music temple grandin in the final of sacks tales shows us what this is like through all of this sacks takes on the role not only of a neurologist and story teller but of a philosopher the philosopher takes the ordinary and puts it under a microscope to show us how it really is just because most of us the impaired call us neurotypicals have brains that smoothly operate thus and so does not mean that we all do some like virgil have to work hard at seeing such basic things as represntations of objects others like temple grandin have to work at understanding the idea of sociality all in all this is a stunning book that will make you think and marvel dare i say if you are like me you will never look at the human brain with quite the same lens as you did before
i recommend dennis littrell 's review of this book on this outlines clearly what the book is about and gives us the basic story of each of the seven chapters the seven cases that make up the book he headlines his review 'extraordinary genius ' and i share this feeling about oliver sachs what i find most remarkable about sachs ' work is his ability to patiently study and work to help people who seem lost completely instead of being as most of us are repelled by these kind of often 'freakish abnormalities ' sachs in studying the people and recounting their cases makes their stories 'human ' he extends in a certain way our conception of what the human is and increases our sense of how remarkable the human mind is he is also a most moving author whose human sympathy and compassion inspire
an anthropologist on mars is the much anticipated to his previous the man who mistook his wife for a hat in it sacks further explores the recesses of the central nervous system 's never ending quest for logic and understanding gestalt tells us that if we look at a broken circle long enough the brain will the missing piece the brain easily embraces a circle but finds no concrete logic to a broken circle thus the brain rejects such a concept as impossible consider our memories most people have heard that eye witness accounts of rare events are digitized in such a way that the brain can change the sequence of events in a manner scewed toward the logical arrangment of the rare event people who have witnessed an aircraft explode during flight most often remember this rare event quite differently immeadiatley after it happens plains do n't explode then crash plains crash then they explode that makes sense to the brain but explode then crash does not make sense ok enough of psych 101. as a neurologist sacks understands how the brain works and is thus able to explain it in an easy going manner it was n't until a skiing accident though inwhich sacks lost a leg and learned first hand the phenomonon of phanthom feeling that he became fully aware of the brains search for logic the brain hates the idea of one leg and thus continues to accept information from something that is n't even there and more remarkably responds to the information now armed with subjectivity as well as objectivity sacks marshalls his considerable talent as a writer and walks a thin line in the telling of our miraculous brain finally it 's clear he really cares about the people he puts forth as examples of neurological insult he offers us a wide variety of people thier afflictions and the results he does seem to favor tourette syndrome as a perfect example of a brain run amuk after all tourette syndrome is named after a student of great french neurologist jean charcot tourette devoted his career to the study of one person who suffered from what we now call tourette syndrome sacks widens the view effectively
this is one of those books which keeps you turning the pages sacks is a neurologist who aside from having insights into the field also obviously truley cares about his subjects he uses this care to get to a depth of explanation of case histories in a manner i have not encountered before highly recommended
these are true tales from a clinical neurologist 's notebook but this is n't just any neurologist oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat 1986 and awakenings 1973 which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks 's work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you 've never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases '' can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence '' it is this 'creative ' potential that forms the central theme of this book '' from sacks 's preface page xvi the first tale the case of the colorblind painter '' is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age and the effect this had on his life and work the second the last hippie '' is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears do n't skip the footnotes ! the third tale a surgeon 's life '' is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette 's syndrome it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful and beloved doctor of surgery sacks scrubs up with bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be the fourth tale to see and not see '' is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings he has a nearly photographic memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was he cares only to his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail the chapter prodigies '' focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars '' sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it at least in my interpretation as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal '' one of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society yet perhaps that is society 's loss i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy '' trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars '' when she views normal '' people sacks allows us to see why bottom line this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed
this is the first oliver sacks book i 've read and i found it fascinating and informative once i started a case history i was to stop reading until i found out the end result i particularly enjoyed the stories about the amnesiac greg and the colorblind artist sacks puts a human face on insights about how our brains work in an intellectually stimulating yet emotionally touching way i found the story about virgil the blind man who gets his sight back and must learn how to see in his particularly the only story i bailed out on was about an autistic woman who works in a cattle slaughterhouse i could not handle the graphic nature of the story i definitely recommend this book if you appreciate shows like nova or if you watch discovery television anyone who wants to know more about the mysteries of our human brains will be enriched by this book
i know very little about psychology but i found this book to be both informative and touching i first heard about it when a cook at my summer camp read us the last hippie '' during an evening program i was fascinated by the story finally when i picked up a copy of the book for myself i read through the whole thing in a day i actually cried during one of the stories oliver sacks teaches you a lot about how the human brain works without getting too clinical and lets the humanity of the people he profiles shine through this is a really good book
oliver sacks ' an anthropologist on mars is a delightful and enlightening book that reveals the unparalleled complexity of the human brain sacks an accomplished neurologist and author presents seven case studies that highlight different neurological phenomena in his case studies sacks follows a newly colorblind painter a man who can create no new memories a surgeon with tourette 's syndrome a blind man who regains his sight a painter obsessed with images from his childhood an autistic boy artist and a autistic professor sacks does not treat his case studies as dry medical oddities but rather discusses their neurological experiences within their broader human existence unlike other authors who know their patients only distantly sacks works intimately with his case studies and develops meaningful relationships that translate into a deeper more insightful understanding of his patients and their experiences while sacks is clearly a brilliant neurologist what makes this book so powerful is his ability to weave in medicine science history and philosophy into a coherent narrative every case study illuminates a series of important and questions that challenge the everyday assumptions of perception reality intelligence and what it means to be human in the end the reader emerges with a better appreciation of the complexity of the human mind the book is very well documented with copious footnotes provided throughout the book occasionally sacks neglects to define some arcane medical terms so readers would do well to keep a dictionary close at hand overall the book is highly accessible to the general reader who will find it intriguing and intellectually rewarding
expertly written the stories are fascinating endearing enlightening you 'll learn so much about how your own mind is wired by reading the stories of these very special people the medical and literary communities need more people like oliver sacks
if you 're interested in campaigns and politics this is a great book to pick up ! although it may seem thick the pages somehow manage to fly by james baker is the epitome of a political guru ! if you did n't know that before reading the book you certainly will know it afterward
you read a book like this to get a feel for what 's it would be like to be considered the gold standard in electoral politics nobody in modern times has had the success or the good fortune to be on the winning side of so many presidential elections one of baker 's competitors is james carville the man who more than any other helped bill clinton to defeat george hw bush and his manager james baker iii in 1992. it was carville who referred to baker as the gold standard to understand james baker you have to understand where he is coming from he was originally a houston based society lawyer '' from a prominent family which allowed him to attend princeton university a society lawyer '' simply caters to the needs of very rich people whatever it is they need the lawyer fixes it quite a nice life if you can do it baker also has a wonderful gregarious personality in person he is charming to a fault and a total class act you have to like the guy the question one needs to ask is how did baker parlay a general legal practice in houston and morph it into becoming probably the second most important person in government under two successive presidents even more interesting is how did baker survive his entire tenure in washington without being either destroyed or contaminated by the system he was able to walk away from his experiences which were quite extensive without anybody laying a glove on him i was involved in a conversation with former president nixon on this topic many years ago the president felt that there were only people in the united states that counted these people own the media the corporations they control the institutions and they have the wealth the president felt that if you stripped this entire group of their wealth power and positions in ten years the wealth and power would be right back where it started from i submit to you that james baker made himself the indispensable man to whoever he came into contact with if you strip baker of his power and position within a few years he would be right back in the thick of it was there some luck involved you bet there was and this book is full of stories where so much luck was involved he specifically mentions in the book that being a marine during the korean war he was transferred to the mediterranean not korea where most of his associates perished in the war was it the luck of the draw that led to his mediterranean assignment or string pulling we will never know and he 's not telling here 's a man that was george bush 's man the current president 's father during the 1980 campaign when bush went head to head against ronald reagan for the republican presidential nomination this was the second time baker moved against reagan he was also part of ford 's team when reagan challenged the seating president for the nomination in 1976. what happens as a result reagan wins the nomination in 1980 and baker joins the reagan team having done a great job during the election process he somehow manages against all odds to maneuver himself into the position of chief of staff to ronald reagan previous to this reagan had always surrounded himself with people with very long track records with him how did baker manage to leap over every one of the loyalists the answer is that this is a very special man i have known a lot of people in washington up close and personal if you are perceptive and interested it really does n't take long to figure out who 's real who 's a phony who gets things done and who does n't there are very few people in james baker 's league there are only two other people i can compare him to the first was abe fortas a former supreme court justice who was one of the most brilliant men to ever serve in government i value a picture i have of him sitting in lyndon johnson 's white house not at the table but in a seat by the window it was obvious fortas was pulling the strings in the room the second man i would compare baker to would be clark clifford he was another magnificent power broker who served every democratic president from harry truman forward for 30 years what 's interesting is that both of these men fortas and clifford had problems late in their careers that tarnished their reputations baker remains untouched by scandal nobody in the last 40 years has enjoyed better relations with the press than james baker i do not ever recall at any point while he served in government reading anything negative that was written about him the only person that came close is colin powell and baker is at the game longer the reason is that nobody cultivated the press like james baker did baker leak to the press he says no but he does admit to providing background to reporters without allowing attribution back to himself it was more than background baker probably provided anything and everything the press required in order to keep his reputation intact there is no other explanation for the continuous favorable press this man received during his entire stay in washington dc a truly cutthroat town he also does n't have a bad word to say about anybody else he simply does n't burn bridges this attitude goes all the way back to his days as a society lawyer if you never say anything negative about people you have an opportunity to have them all as clients everybody loves james baker i particularly enjoy reading a book like this because you pick up certain ideas and possibilities about politics that you will just never learn any other way because there 's just so much noise out there that it 's overwhelming let me give you a couple of notions '' when wounded stop the bleeding immediately '' here baker is telling us that when it goes bad for you in politics you have to deal with the issue immediately and kill the issue do n't wait or you 're dead an example would be senator kerry 's failure to respond to the misleading swift boat accusations made against him in the 04 presidential election cycle '' first time out win or lose you learn a lot '' he 's telling you that there is no substitute for experience you may not win the race the first time as baker lost with ford in 1976 but it prepared him for 1980 where he became the gold standard in politics '' proximity is power '' yes absolutely you want an office close to the president the closer the office the more power you absolutely have and are perceived to have '' tax hikes without spending restraints never balance the budget congress always spends the new money and more '' how brilliant is this statement it explains perfectly the last six years under a republican dominated presidency and congress whoever is in power spends money it does n't matter who it is or what party he 's from '' image trumps substance '' wow did he get this one right it 's all about perception or better yet take credit for all miracles occurring within 50 miles '' better to assume the worst and try to do something about it than to assume the best and get blindsided '' this is a lesson we could all take with us '' prior preparation prevents poor performance he learned this from his father and mentions it many times throughout the book practicing what he called the five p 's held him in good steed throughout his career and he continues to practice this behavior today if you have an interest in politics and history you would do well to take the time to peruse this book it 's an easy read baker is not looking to sell you or persuade you in this book read it and you will learn what life at the top of washington was like during a very interesting period in our nation 's history good luck richard stoyeck
i did not know a great deal about james baker before i read this book but i mean it as a compliment to the clarity of his reminiscences when i say i think i do now in the field of political autobiography it is not always the case that one emerges knowing more about the author and subject than when one began from the pages of his book i discern that james baker is not without wit albeit at times a distinctly biting one he is also less a statesman than a politician and less a politician than a man with protective loyalty to his friends he is perhaps above all someone with a talent for inserting himself into a situation and calling on a lifetime 's worth of contacts when there is a need to get things done in short to his party and to its inner circle baker is invaluable james addison baker began his adult life as an apolitical texas democrat and emerges today four decades after he took up campaigning as a form of therapy after his wife 's passing as an elder tactician of the republican party his is the sort of book that will deservedly please republicans understandably miff democrats raise a few eyebrows and hackles here and there among independents and ultimately i fear its anecdotes about such varying matters as families ties surpassing race the real '' way politics in america works his compliments on the brilliance of presidents ford reagan and bush as well as others with whom he has served short the best part of the book unfortunately be lost on many who purchase it for strictly political reasons let me point out now that this book is not about baker 's political neutrality nor was it expected to be but one of its strengths is that i think james baker wrote candidly that 's also one of its weaknesses for while i admired the similar candidness that went into jesse helms ' memoir last year this book does make baker come across a few times as something of a vindictive man i think in large part baker used this often interesting of his role in modern political affairs as a platform to get even a time or two with those against whom he feels grudges particularly former vice president al gore whose attacks on both baker and baker 's boss former president bush during the 1992 white house race became as baker seems to have seen it a little too personal what is interesting about baker 's book is of course its recounting of his service in several republican administrations and also his role as a major behind the scenes player in the election campaigns that placed many of those politicians there baker most recently was a strategist who oversaw the current president bush 's 2000 white house run and while there does seem some merit in his reminder that the final supreme court decision that settled the disputed 2000 election was rendered in my opinion i could n't help but see baker leaving behind some of his candidness and resorting to becoming a strategist even after that particular battle is long over this is a relatively short and surprisingly sort of trek back through the life of an extremely man and while i disagree with baker on many issues i did think much of what he had to say was interesting and that it serves as a unique view into a realm of politics typically to most of us
in reflecting upon the life of james baker through his second memoir 'work hard study and keep out of politics ! ' the one thing that continued to stay in my mind is baker 's openess that one of the reasons why he stayed in politics was 'power ' what a refreshing statement the truth ! this is not so minimal a statement when reading the many political memoirs published particularly from the politicians who have published throughtout the years the life of jame baker is quite remarkable and the sharing of his life and decisions as shared in this memoir are encompassing of service to this nation well done i may not necessarily agree with all the decisions made by baker during the years he served 3 different presidents but i do respect the man and the integrity of this book there rings certain truths throughout and his openess about 'power ' provide a sense of credability to his perspectives
i ca n't recommend this book highly enough i read the original book and loved it but knew there was more that i was missing the workbook asks detailed and sometimes confronting questions and acts as an aide to hearing god i found once i started asking god these questions i had the insight i needed to break through so many of the walls i 'd put to god myself and others as a result my relationships are healthier and i am a less defensive person
i never take the time to write reviews so take this as a sixth star '' for the sacred romance along with it 's study guide companion i first read the book a year ago and had a '' reaction to it it was good and it helped me take a unique look at god 's most dramatic act of love on our behalf still i pretty much forgot about it not long after i read it i ca n't tell you how different my reaction to this book was about a year later when my small group decided to use for our lesson wow ! we now have a level of trust with each other and with that trust have been able to share old wounds of the heart that were prohibiting us from the most important relationship of our lives a relationship with god of course and we were also able to build each other up if you are in a small group i urge you to consider the sacred romance if everyone in your group is honest and takes the chance to be a little vulnerable with each other it will change the dynamics of how you study together dramatically
read this if you desire to take you faith to the edge with on the living god as your guid
since i am a world 's fair fanatic '' i have read almost everything that i can on the subject in general this is an interesting and well researched book the author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about however i must point up three rather glaring errors in the book in describing the louisiana world expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be 80 feet tall just 150 feet shorter than the eiffel tower '' since the eiffel tower is actually over 900 feet tall the new orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet may have been a typo which the author did not catch in other error states that the us pavilion at the brussels world 's fair of 1958 was a large squat round concrete block structure '' it was indeed large and round but not squat and not made of concrete to the excellent book about edward durrell stone the architect of the pavilion the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light i have seen photos of the us pavilion and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me in comparison to the soviet pavilion which resembled a large refrigerator ! thirdly the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the exhibited at a expo they had a large pavilion at the new york world 's fair of 1939. all in all however i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world 's fairs
the author is definately very qualified to write this book he generally keeps the reader engrossed as he creates the backdrop and context for each of the fairs unfortunately he doesnt go very in depth into any particular fair and the reader is left craving more photos the author frequently boasts about his extensive collection of memorabilia but too little is shown its enjoyable for a quick read but if you are interested in more in depth knowledge and imagery you should investigate one of the more comprehensive books
i loved this book ever since my high school english teacher chastised me for trying to put miller 's the crucible in the context of the mccarthy era i have been fascinated with the social context surrounding the creation of art jones focuses on the political as well as social context that has given birth to the great and the mediocre of the american musical first his use of terms such as diversionary '' ring so true for those of us who love mindless fluff when we go to the theatre second i was shocked at how little i had appreciated the contributions of inter alia to the american stage prior to reading this book but mostly i liked how he articulated how a writer 's gestalt accounts for the end product on the stage and his description of how musicals come into being the book gave me the backstory to many of the original shows i had the good fortune to see on broadway i for one would love a volume ii of this book to be jones ' next foray i especially offer this to aspiring young actors writers directors and songwriters as a required read before embarking on a life in musical theater if you want to create art you must know from whence you came
as a lover of musical theater and minor toiler in the vineyards myself i have probably read hundreds of books on the subject therefore it is always a special treat to find one that brings a fresh slant to the subject jones ' book does just that by treating musical theater styles neither as a simple reflection of nor an escape from the world at large but rather as an integral part of the whole he presents a broad but always entertaining and view of both the century and musical theater 's part within same there are as there always are in works of this scope some factual errors no strings '' was n't richard rodgers ' only public '' credit as a lyricist he 's also so credited on the score for the tv musical androcles the lion '' it ai n't every it is public ! but none that take anythng away from the achievement of the work
the begining of the book is a little tough being a white male '' but this a book that everyone should read ! the world would be a better place if they did
this book and the others by anne wilson schaef have helped me to put my own experience with family and society into a healthy perspective i say bravo to this lady and her work ! excellent ! this work put me on the path to true emotional healing and understanding of why people act in harmful ways i say no less than brillant thanks anne ! ! you rock
this brilliantly innovative thinker throws back the curtains on our collective society 's understanding of ourselves and opens up possibilities for really positive solutions to what ails our society as a whole and its individuals in particular ! schaef addresses all forms of addiction from chemical to behavioral and sees within our society 's gradual acceptance of its own corruptions the seven deadly sins of anger covetousness envy gluttony lust pride and sloth perpetuating our malaise we see in our leaders the aspects of control dishonesty and dualism seeing only two alternative solutions to any problem it is shocking to face these at first but once the truth of it dawns on the reader is led through the greatest assisting factors toward our collective recovery '' process the ideas used in the programs sobriety fastest route to clear thinking and spirituality not necessarily the dogmatic sort that keeps us in the submissive state ! this book is not for the person too busy to have time to digest something wonderfully deep and enriching ! reading it is like taking a shower in the purest cleansing water and emerging to absorb its message like rays of powerful sunshine ! it is empowering a fantastic door opening to the possibilities of our becoming a truly free and healthy society of thinking alive deprogrammed individuals ! read this one before any of her other books ! her newly coined terms will become valuable assets in your vocabulary and liberated
this is a top book it analyses the addiction patterns of individuals from the perspective of the addictive patterns in society as a whole ann wilson schaef goes beyond analysis of the problem '' of addiction to a very encouraging vision of another way of being alive one that is mostly forgotten in our numb modern society if you are looking for some ways out of the cycle of addiction this may be an important roadmap for you
due to the pressures of modern life many people are addicts of one kind or schaef shows how society as a whole behaves in addictive usually think of an addict as being someone addicted to a drug but there are many kinds of are substance addictions such as to alcohol drugs nicotine caffeine and activities can become process addictions such as accumulating money gambling sex work religion and relationships can also be politicians behave like addicts as they are hooked on control promising things will get better but they do not denying problems and denying alternative ways of doing all adds up to the addictive system which is modern concludes that we can not allow anything to come between us and our spirituality or between us and our living we do we shall destroy ourselves and those around us this is a very worthwhile book with penetrating insight into modern life

when i first picked up this book i was immediately reminded of the 'amok dispatch ' catalogue back in 1989 the amok bookstore out of released a sourcebook for the extremes of information in print the book was an unbelievable find a real jewel in the age virtually every author who appeared in the 'pulps ' section of that catalogue has found themselves listed in this new rough guide for anyone who is tired of the bestseller lists and is looking for something different to read this guidebook is indispensable ! it features all the offbeat wonderful authors who can lay claim to breaking new ground in literature some are well known bestselling authors vonnegut camus tolkien ellroy palahniuk pynchon others are celebrated more for their lifestyles than their actual work the infinitely emulated kerouac bukowski and henry miller still others are infamous selby de sade burroughs beirce while many many others have been either criminally ignored forgotten or just faded with time crews himes mishima bowles dick willeford trocchi gysin et al all have devoted some would say slavish readerships that have allowed for their works to remain in print one way or the other over the years i have many of the writers in this collection but the real treasures are to be found with some of the other entries in the guide you 're bound to discover several new writers in this collection which along with some extra facts that you may not have known about some of your favourite authors makes it well worth buying some of you who have n't yet delved into the literary underworld are in for a real treat i envy your upcoming voyage of discovery the guide is set up simply and efficiently it covers over 200 novelists but also branches out to include classic cult books by authors who never became cult figures themselves as well as graphic novels beloved characters faves and even some trivia i know about most of the authors mentioned in the book but there were still quite a few surprises as well as some illuminating facts bios and recommended reads that made it well worth buying i highly highly recommend this guide for people who are ready to branch out from the bestsellers the old classics and mainstream pulp a whole new world of ideas
first a word about the term cult fiction and its implications when i first saw the title of this little book i assumed it would be full of wreckages like burroughs and dick while the rough guide does contain them as it should its scope is far greater than writers of that type in here you 'll find a wind range of novelists reviewed including graham greene john fowles even zane grey bottom line an excellent resource for readers
i picked this up on a recent vacation to minnapolis and found i could n't put it down i do think the book does omit some key cult writers but the ones who are included are handled by writers who obviously know their subjects this guide includes a lot of my favorite writers jonathan coe italo calvino jasper fforde borges etc and i was pleased to find out some things about their lives and work that i did n't know before the guide points out the writers ' essential works and suggests what a particular writer might have in common with another writer the book is often funny without being
let 's face it most books about writing are b o r i n they usually range from dry to dry i 've often thought of this as a case of physician heal thyself '' ryan 's ridiculously long title made me wonder if his book would land squarely in the middle of that dry pile i was pleasantly surprised to be wrong ryan has a straightforward and practical approach to writing in fact he goes as far as to talk about writer 's intuition and dares to promote a straightforward writing approach plan then write '' this book talks about general corporate writing but the information can be applied to other types of writing where we need to remember that every word we write whether in team communication or in our work product is an opportunity this book is great for less experienced writers trying to find structure in a formless void and it is perhaps equally valuable for experienced writers who are trying to call themselves back to the basics
this book tells the two real secrets that create good business writing rule of thumb and writer 's intuition it also shares a very special secret in all good writing how to avoid the approach that ruins most writers before they begin
another book about writing well who needs it you ask my answer is anyone who wants to write better those who want to be better writers must continually practice their skills sure you could probably improve your style without this book but why not learn a few more tricks of the trade i especially enjoyed the rewrite examples rewriting history '' was particularly interesting expend a bit of energy reading and studying ryan 's book and then expect to write with a bit more ease someone once commented that even good writers need perpetual reassurance write up the corporate ladder '' is that reassurance
at last a clear and practical book that gets right down to the real issues excellent writing skills are critical to success in today 's world ryan gives proven and valuable steps to bring your writing to a new level of clarity and conciseness a real must have book
with time becoming more valuable each day and email evolving as the convenient mode of communication people tend to rush through common and simple memos and correspondence which can lead to bad writing habits and the potential for costly mistakes now that we have the technology to simplify communication it 's time to upgrade our own communication skills to avoid the pitfalls and upon what we 're trying to say kevin ryan not only gives us the tools to improve our writing but he introduces us to successful people who already have i write back cover promotional pieces for a book publisher and i 've cut hours from the amount of time it takes to create new fresh and clear copy here 's a book that 's right for the times
quick read that 's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children and how that impacts the adult lives of those children iles has quickly become a favorite author of mine with turning angel being the first book i read and this being the second i look forward to reading his other works
if you 're interested in forensics chances are you 'll like this book the book also manages to tie in sexual abuse repressed memories vietnam ptsd and a little romance it even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long i was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book 's plot and discussions as intricate as they are
based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes iles is a better writer than grisham i picked up this book i do n't know if iles can outwrite grisham but he is definitely a contender i found blood memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists but it is on the grim side the main character pursues solving two mysteries one a serial killer on the loose and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie in the end the two mysteries are related though i think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen as an aside i remain amazed and impressed that iles can so effectively write a novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of sexual abuse not a five star but a solid four
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first 100 pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it
i guess it 's high praise for iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child drinking valium baths in scalding water this was a thoroughly gripping book that at 764 pages long i was sad to see come to an end greg iles does n't shy from the sensitive subject of pedophilia and tackles it with unflinching honesty there is no way to guess the nomurs bad guy '' in this book til the very end i do n't care what the australian said who apparently solved the mystery in the first chapter but i 'm disappointed that the author did not interweave the natchez and new orleans crimes better it does get repetitive like some said but i still highly recommend this book if you 're looking for a taut atmospheric suspense mystery very and fresh
one of the boldest of the bold kudos to iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists nambla has been put on notice this is work of pure satisfaction from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero cat another worthy pile of words from iles despite his ignorance regarding black people the dialog is downright embarrassing but keep trying iles if you hang out with rather than watch them on tv perhaps you 'll get 5 stars next time
this is the first book i 've read by greg iles however it will not be the last ! this book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues after reading this book i better understand my mother who was sexually abused and her response to my sexual abuse she was able to sheild me from parental sexual abuse but not from my then boyfriend i found it very helpful that iles gave contact numbers and information at the end of the book regarding sexual abuse this book will help you to see the signs of abuse if you like cat ferry are willing and able to open your mind to the truth of what you witness
as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse i found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person this book will stick with me a long time and i hope even though it is long readers will give it the chance it deserves i thought this work by iles to be very insightful
read this book at a light warehouse because you will not want to be anywhere near the dark !
it is one of my favorite stephen king novels i 've ever read possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books it is extremely long and i must admit that i had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it i know it 's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long this novel has some of the best character development i 've ever read and the reader gets a chance to really get to know each character even a chance to know more about each character that you might care to highly recommended even if you are n't a king fan
when i first read this book upon finishing it i immediately proceeded to rip it 's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces that was how much the story affected me it disgusted me it disturbed me it moved me after brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head and if that 's not the mark of a great writer i do n't know what is i then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again amid all the horror that stephen king has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination this has to be the most disturbing disgusting and at times offensive work he has ever set to paper forget the movie this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath with this book and the tommyknockers '' stephen king has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer but a great writer period buy it read it
although i 'm only 14 year old boy who lives in utah i 've been a die hard stephen king fan since i was twelve and i have to say this is really the high light of his career do n't be turned off by the massive length of this book it goes by very quickly and you 'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages as i 'm sure you know this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges other people have already gone over the basic story but one thing that most of them failed to mention that i find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it all of them but mike hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it yes this book is vulgar it is violent and there is some sexuality it is an essential part of the story it is over a thousand pages long and each page is genius i will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book i 've ever read because it 's so much more than a horror story i think this book has greater characters than any other book i have ever read this is a five star book and is almost completely flawless this is my favorite book and some of stephen king 's other great works are the dead zone misery the shining and christine read this book it is well worth your time i wo n't go in depth into the story because hundreds of other people already have but this book will scare the piss out of you make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it and really just change you i ca n't express in words how great this is but do n't take my word for it buy it rent it whatever just read it no pun intended
wow what an epic the book draws you in to the sinister world of derry maine so quickly and deeply that you do n't want to leave when the last page is read with a book so large in volume and scope each reader is bound to find faults with the story but this world is so full of rich characters these problems disappear into the pages and eventually vanish i originally read this book in high school after my first 15 years later the horror of the what goes on in the town of derry every 28 years had a bigger impact on me however the adventure and wonderment i pulled from the story then came flooding back again the first half of the book is a coming of age story with evil stalking the town as a backdrop the second half of the book is a story of and responsibility with evil lurking closer in each character 's shadows just a fantastic book that reminds the reader of the power we had as children
a book that enables you to travel back in time back to 1958 back to a time when there was stan mike richie bev eddie ben and big bill and some others back when some kids ' main concern was avoiding henry bowers ! a story that although long over a thousand pages and in 'it ' years probably much longer kept my attention throughout maybe you 'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear fear of the unknown and fear of the known a chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences so that you really care what happens to them good and bad !
i wish this book had been available when i was 30 years younger as it might have helped me avoid some serious life errors i would have even been happy if this book was available when my daughter married 8 years ago however even though the gems of wisdom came too late for us i recommend that all brides and wives read this book if they want to learn to improve their life being supportive of their husband yet never giving up their right to be treated well robin mcgraw strikes just the right balance of compassion and determination it is instructional without being preachy '' though best for christians the wisdom could apply to women of any or no formal religious faith it would be a good idea for young grooms to read this too to get an insiders view from the other side i bought the book because of the show on phil about the book okay i confess i wanted to read the dirt '' on phil but it was a delight in that you got the dirt '' but learned that the truth was given with a heaping helping of compassion i do n't know if i would enjoy hanging out with phil he is intense but i think i would love robin she admits to what she did wrong and tells women how they can find their voice to make the best life possible for themselves and their families if your life is n't perfect and i 've yet to find anyone whose life is then read the book and if you agree pass it on to your sisters biological or otherwise here 's to mcgraw family values ! ! !
i loved robin mcgraw 's book ! her message regarding relationships husbands children and life in general is an important lesson for all of us life can throw all sorts of roadblocks before us but if we trust in god and try to maintain a positive attitude we will triumph over them i feel that robin wants all of us to experience the joys that are just waiting for us in life thank you robin for sharing your story with us
this is a fabulous book filled with common sense which is not so common after all ! robin shares her perspective on being a wife mother daughter daughter in law and most of all a woman it 's not a self help '' book but more of a this is how i did it you can do it too '' book i really liked that she spoke about how women need to put themselves first self care on all levels to fill whatever roles we need and the personal devastation she went through in her own life because people around her did n't do this
i loved this book and could n't put it down i read it in two days i wish i had a book like this to read when i was younger i recommed it to all young women and to older women too we are never to old to learn i just ordered another copy for my youngest daughter as i did n't want to give my copy up thank you robin for sharing with us
to be honest with you i only received the books i ordered yesterday and i had no intensions to read the book by edwards i bought the books for my two adult daughters as christmas presents however i heard edwards talking about her life and i assume the book on some tv program and was quite impressed with what she had to say my daughters are young adults and have not had to experience much loss or troubles in their lives i think edwards relates to women that will help them through touch times in their lives and i would like my children to be able to handle those times as well as edwards did and does she seems to be a strong and well adjusted person by the way i would n't mind reading the book myself and i am the father of the daughters mentioned above
this is an amazing book that every woman should read and or listen to mcgraw is an incredable individual and phil should be very proud to have her for his wife ! the show now should be the robin and phil show '' for robin has as much to give to us as phil for woman with passion and purpose ''
excellent topic for woman of all ages this showes woman how to be strong without being masculine and threatening their partener
if you 've ever been suicidally depressed like tina which i have then this book may well change your whole life ! the power of tina 's story is in the simplicity of her words and the courage of her traumatized soul i found myself crying from time to time while reading this book because it touched so many chords in my own broken heart the fact that god used a patrolman to save her life is just one part of this incredibly moving and unforgettable story i had never heard of tina zahn until i read this book and now i ca n't stop telling people especially those who are struggling with depression and trauma issues to read this book ! you wo n't regret reading it either i assure you it will speak to your heart in a graphic but tender way
this is a great book for anyone who has ever battled depression or knows someone who has it really hit home for me and while i never went as far as to take my own life i felt many of the feelings she describes after the birth of my second child it 's nice to know you are not alone thank you for sharing your story of hope and healing mops was also a saving grace for me in my struggles as well thanks mops ! !
women especially will connect with this book whether they 've experienced postpartum depression or not as i read it i realized how many women in my own life had experienced abuse rejection and depression that was so debilitating they considered taking their own life you 'll want to read this book for yourself and recommend it to others to share in tina 's struggles her miraculous rescue and her ultimate triumph through faith medical help and the support of her friends and her husband a great read that you wo n't forget
i have read literally thousands of books in my lifetime but i have never read a book quite like this first i am from wisconsin and have actually been to many of the places that tina mentions in her story second i too have struggled for many years with serious depression i 've never actually attempted suicide but i came very close to it one night 10 years ago it is only by the grace of god that i did n't attempt suicide that night i truly believe that god intervened in my life that night even though i did n't yet know christ as my savior i have struggled with serious depression off and on for the past 15 years there have been five or six periods in my life where i have felt seriously depressed for months at a time there is definitely a stigma in the church when it comes to depression a lot of people simply do n't know how to handle it i could relate to so many of tina 's struggles tina 's story is also my story i am so thankful that tina had the courage and strength to share such a deeply personal struggle with the world i believe that this book will give hope to those of us who struggle with depression but i believe it will also help those who have never had a problem with depression to be more compassionate and understanding struggling with serious depression can make you feel so alone and like there is no one who really understands but this book showed me that i am not alone in my struggles and that even if no one else does god understands and cares i cried numerous times as i read this book this book has helped me believe that there is hope and help is available i do not have to suffer alone reading tina 's story also makes me want to begin counseling in order to deal with my depression and other issues openly and honestly i thank god for sparing tina 's life and motivating her to share her story i highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to people who struggle with depression i also recommend this book to friends and family of people who are depressed i thank god for motivating me to buy this book this is one book i know i will never forget
this is an amazing story thank god tina zahn lived to tell it in this and account of a troubled life that eventually leads to an attempted suicide we learn the true story behind the sensational footage of a young woman 's leap from wisconsin 's tallest bridge battling severe postpartum depression after the birth of her second child coupled with unresolved traumas of sexual abuse by her stepfather that began at the tender age of five we indeed learn why tina zahn jumped remarkably all the elements were in place to rescue her the book begins with the dramatic call to by her husband and the ensuing police chase along with the swift actions of the officer who reached out and grabbed her wrist saving her from a plunge and certain death she then goes back in time and tells the wrenching account of her stepfather 's abuses she did n't discover he was n't her biological father until many years later and her mother 's neglect one ca n't help but applaud zahn 's bravery for sharing her story and for including useful reference material at the end to help us all recognize the signs of sexual abuse and depression and where to go for help this is a spiritual journey and i recommend it not only for readers learning to diagnose signs of depression postpartum and otherwise but also to attain a greater understanding of these illnesses and how to cope with loved ones who may be suffering readable in an afternoon from the author of a line between friends '' mckenna publishing group
i saw tina zahn on oprah so i bought the book for my sister and i to read tina grew up in a rough family i think her should be shot and her sister and mother are insensitive tina zahn is a true survivor and an inspiration to mothers who may suffer from post partum depression

to the brilliant mind of lincoln rhyme it becomes apparent early into the murder investigation that there are two killers involved working in tandem and perhaps one in slave to the other a ticking clock is left at the first puzzling murder scene at the docks and it at first appears as if someone has been suspended until their painful death finally relieves them of their agony it 's nasty and its attention grabbing to a city that will always forever after be hyper aware of the danger in the every day a careful killer is calling himself the watchmaker '' but for the investigating team that all seems a little obvious there are plenty of crime scenes but where are the bodies police forensic consultant and former detective lincoln rhyme as always feels immense frustration that he is not out there with his team walking his own personally devised murder scene grid '' and so must take some satisfaction in that his best eyes and ears amelia sachs is out there to do it for him sachs has her eye on some future goal that might not involve police work and this is despite the fact that she is riding her first case as lead homicide detective some of those in the department have always wanted the bright amelia sachs to fall from a great height and when her current case leads her down the road into her father 's own policing past she is more able to understand why deaver is a master at suspense and the ticking clock element to this novel is only a small part of that there are always so many layers to the lincoln rhyme novel that it 's delightful to have the knowledge that an early answer will never be the answer deaver we expect to always work the suspense screws skifully right up until the final pages this is a better novel than the previous one or two in the series which puzzled more than entertained the cold moon is more tightly crafted with greater cohesion between merging plotlines which there always seems to be and less extraneous elements are involved this series is n't read for the warm and fuzzy character development and stripping it all back down to the action of the escalating hunt has made for a far better read on the flip side of this some of the personal issues have been dragged out too far in the series and need to be dealt with fans of the series need to have resolution on teasers that were introduced many novels ago and a retrospective novel probably would n't be a bad inclusion either not an original thought but would probably be timely if you have n't read a jeffery deaver novel before the cold moon would give you a good feel for the series and deaver makes solid work of providing enough supporting information to enable his books to be read as stand alones a great book in a stellar series that still has no peer
it 's been awhile since i had a really good crime mystery read therefore i was excited when the cold moon by jeffery deaver arrived at the library the latest lincoln rhyme novel delivered just what i was looking for twists turns and plenty of forensic work the plotline here starts out on two tracks a killer nicknamed the watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques his signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene rhyme and amelia sachs his partner are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder the murder points to a bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis there 's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt so sachs has to step carefully as it 's not clear who she can trust the two cases converge when the watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that sachs is investigating but the layering of deception goes even deeper than that and rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind the watchmaker if you want plot twists and turns this book will definitely satisfy there are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion only to be something else entirely the layering of plots by the killer never seems to end and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction a couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top but not so much as to put me off the story it 's a book i really did n't want to put down even though i had other things i should be
after terrible lincoln rhyme books deaver gets his act together in the cold moon as a big lincoln fan i am hoping this continues as i was ready to stop buying rhyme books if you have n't already read bone collector empty chair and coffin dancer you 're missing out
although the plot twists in deaver books sometimes are a bit of a stretch they are certainly never dull this books has more twists that a pretzel factory i never divulge plots when reviewing i would simply say this is a great mystery and well worth your time enjo

a number of reviewers have complained about this book saying that it really would n't happen this way that the twists and turns of the plot which is a staple with deaver are too far fetched to believe well of course it is not believable the police are not going to go to an outsider for forensic work unless it is with one of the big well known firms who will give them credibility when it comes to court a working detective with the police department who discovers dirty cops is going to be hated throughout the department need i go on the answer is but so what here is a well told if somewhat familar tale about a detective his sidekick a serial murderer a truly evil bad guy twists and turns aplenty and an overall very enjoyable read i 'd suggest that you read all the lincoln rhyme novels in the sequence they were published the characters do grow and change somewhat as the books progress still each of his books stands alone as a pretty good way to spend a cold weekend or a long airplane flight
my first deaver i want more also my first book review the book was really fun to read but i agree with some of the other reviewers here who said the plot twists strained credulity still i love the way deaver paints people so vividly and scenes and the conversations made me laugh he 's a master at this katherine dance for instance she was the cop from california who helped interview the suspects now my question is is there really such an interview technique as the one she uses throughout the book i did a few searches nothing came up so far very interesting anyway that 's my review i recommend the book basically despite the mazelike plot i 've found a new favorite author
this unique book tells the story of a bunch of intrepid and inspired men who pioneered the exploration of the last great unknown the deeps of the sea how would you fancy wading out under water with nothing more than an inverted coal bucket over your head would you agree to a fight a shark equipped with nothing more than a knife all so that some movie company could film the gory encounter inventive adventurous foolhardy to the point of recklessness many of the diving pioneers were also in their own right like the great biologist jbs haldane who worked out how to survive at dangerous depths others evolved from treasure seekers to become the first underwater archaeologists exploring ancient shipwrecks in exotic waters or most interesting of all opening our eyes to the beauty of marine habits and wildlife including the seriously threatened coral reefs the author himself a marine biologist and diver blends all this into a magical weave of fact and wonder enlivened by a mordant wit and a delightful eye for quirky detail i would recommend it to any reader
fast shipping and great shape the only problem we had was that the cd inside the book was for indesign instead of photoshop
this book is very easy to follow each chapter begins by telling you what it will cover and how long it will take to complete the book comes with a cd which contains lesson plans for each chapter the object is to have you work along as the chapter progresses giving you some practice it is definitely a useful resource for the beginner photoshop student
quite honest book and matches with any beginner 's expectation cd works really fine illustrating each and every example should the reader classify himself as a photo shop regular user scott kelby the photoshop book '' will be more aggressive
i purchased this book for my class and i was not disappointed i knew very little about photoshop when i started my online class and i felt that this book was very helpful and answered pretty much all my user questions i would recommend this book for people who want to learn the basics about using photoshop
im a college student ive taken multiple classes that were supposed to teach '' us software via textbooks and this is by far the easiest book to follow i have no formal experience with the software i just bought it recently because this is the last year i will be able to take advantage of a student discount on software and i thought it would come in handy ive burned thru the first of the book in 3 nites prolly 2 hours a its not tedious at all very straight forward and color illustrated step by step they give you the keyboard shortcuts as well as the pull down menu commands upfront and it guides you through the things you will actually use without alot of i will be ordering the rest of the series on adobe software to learn the rest of the web bundle probably the best 45 ive spent on textbooks yet
i 've tried learning photoshop many times before but each book i read made me loose interest this book is fun and arranged in a way so that lessons are neither too long nor too short
this is the or book i have purchased about photoshop i wish it had been my first purchase because i am finally now learning the ins '' and outs '' of adobe 's photoshop when i finish the lessons and projects in this book i believe the other books on the same subject will be easy to understand
this is definitely a hands on book the clear color pictures and illustrations are rather concise and informing i am about in the middle of the book now and am already tweaking family photos
the classroom in a book series is great for describing functions and tools a user would otherwise not become familiar with however the illustrator text is more accurate in describing how the software responds that is some settings and functions do not work like or are not housed where described in the photoshop text still the book is useful and i 'm happy with it 's use as a resource
how one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time i did n't find the book funny in the least but i got the humor with which the story was told this book was a read for me not because i could n't put it down but because i felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing i ca n't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and i frequently felt sick reading it but truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it i 'm glad i did i was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive which was no easy feat
this book is great augusten burroughs is genius and a great storyteller ! i could n't put it down
what happened to american girls to women over the past hundred years that caused a quantum shift in how they present themselves to the world intelligence spirituality charity and volunteerism and skills for all things domestic were once revered the most popular girl in her class was n't the prettiest girl the girl considered best for marriage had the qualities desired for a wife and mother and not what she looked like on her husband 's arm we are all victims of this shift i admit i first noticed this book on a shelf in a bookstore because of the flat tanned belly on the cover we 've become a society obsessed with pieces and parts and appearances of the pieces and parts rather than the beauty of the whole person our is measured by the numbers on the scale or the size of our jeans or the clarity of our skin over the past six years i 've reread this book a few times and always find a new point that rings true in her revealing yet not surprising sociological history blumberg uses the best and most frank sources to illustrate her case the private diaries of young women from the victorian era to present day the late 90 's blumberg theorizes that it 's the media and consumerism that are the biggest contributors to the shift and uses excerpts from the diaries to make her point blumberg focuses on caucasian girls circa 1998 and perhaps the book needs an update to focus on a broader demographic as well as address the influence of the internet which has since become an increasingly important factor in the socialization and of young women i think this is a decent book for a teenage girl but i 'm not sure it will have much of a positive influence girls are constantly being fed about how they should look and what products they should buy to achieve beauty it 's a better book for a woman in her 20 's or 30 's who might want a better understanding of why we 've become the way we are
this book was referenced in a text that i read regarding teen sexuality and since the reference sounded interesting i found a copy of it brumberg discusses here what she calls the body projects '' of teenage and adult women and how these projects have changed over time by body projects '' she means what women are focused on changing about themselves at a particular place in history whether it be the face the body or their sexuality in describing these particular projects the author goes into detail about the history of menarche and menstruation acne and the hymen while also discussing the history of the social aspects of virginity and how female sexuality was and is perceived and discussed within a family and society i really enjoyed reading this book for many reasons first it is rare that you can find a social history text that covers such a variety of subjects second the author uses diary entries from women from many different time periods to elucidate her points and reading the accounts of victorian women can be very entertaining they thought what ! '' while also enlightening and educational third the author makes a major point to remind the reader that girls today are maturing earlier in a world filled with sexualized images and messages yet we are denying them education as to how to safely use these new bodies they have developed she describes how we are doing our girls a disservice by not assisting them with creating their own moral codes and standards which i very much agree with i would suggest this book to any woman especially a woman who has a daughter who is or will be a teenager the dialogues that brumberg suggests need to happen and reading this book may spark that realization in all of us
joan jacobs brumberg 's the body project an intimate history of american girls is a fascinating read as an teacher and researcher on the field of young women and coming of age i am quite pleased by the wealth of information both scholarly and anecdotal i learned from this book brumberg fleshes out an analysis of girls ' body projects from the to the present day and supplements her vast research with diary accounts from young women throughout history while i enjoyed this book i did find a few parts to be undeveloped or perhaps glossed over i am at odds with brumberg 's analysis in the section on pierced parts '' she seems to make rather hasty and unfounded conclusions about the symbolic significance of piercing among teenagers i did not feel as though brumberg was informed enough on the piercing phenomenon on a positive note this part of the book and many others will generate a lot of interesting discussion when i use it in the classroom we will have to fill in the gaps brumberg has left behind speaking of gaps i also wish but i can certainly understand the limitations and confines of academic research that brumberg had devoted more of her book to an analysis of the body projects among women while she did offer some interesting information on the body projects of african american jewish and latina women i found myself aching for more than just a few token pages the topic of women and their bodies has long been a benchmark of feminist inquiry and discussion brumberg 's contribution to this topic and her conceptualization of it as the body project '' provides new insight into an old yet persistent problem in our society a fascinating and highly recommended read
in her book brumberg recognizes the struggles that young women go through in order to feel accepted in society and discusses a variety of body projects ranging from acne troubles to anorexia i think that most women today have felt the pressure that is driving them to make their bodies perfect and therefore can relate their own lives directly to the situations that are presented i found it interesting to read about the lives of many victorian girls that had had problems so similar to my own and how they confronted those problems in very different ways i found this book to be very informative and although it contained captivating information brumberg continually repeated her earlier thoughts in later chapters i thought that she could have added more depth to her commentary to make her work a stronger piece of literature
i learned a lot from this book about the history of how girls ' bodies have overtime become more and more public it is such a compelling read ! this book has inspired me to do something to keep society from affecting my view of my own body as well as for future women and girls
this book was an amazing journey that helped me understand the underpinnings of the modern american woman 's relationship with sexuality by tracing the roots of our modern traditions to their victorian foundations brumberg educates the reader and also paints a stark picture of the way young girls have started to come into their sexuality in the past few decades she argues that girls today are out of sync that their bodies develop before they are emotionally ready to deal with issues of sexuality she further asserts and proves in my opinion that the historical move away from economies and social structures has robbed modern girls of vital mentoring from their adult female relatives this lack of female mentoring leads to the confusion and insecurity that anyone who watches mtv can not deny is rampant today this book is an important read for educators parents and anyone interested in unerstanging how and why young women today experience sexualization by a culture all too ready to exploit their insecurities for profit all in all a fascinating and very readable study of a crucial subject
brumberg 's work details the changes in cultural constructions of the adolescent body in the twentieth century focusing on how young women create maintain and alter body images and ultimately body i use this book as the first monograph assignment in my introduction to women 's studies course although the book has a strong theoretical framework the descriptive examples in the chapters help to facilitate discussion in the class which really sets the tone for the rest of the semester college women find the book engaging and they are very personally affected by the stories that relate so well to them i find it an extremely informative very useful book
dick staub does a fabulous job of tying in the old teachings of the bible with the very popular star wars saga ! this is an amazing book and it is very insightful if you are looking to change your life and be a better christian this book is for you ! ! ! this book is also great for people following jediism who are christian i recommend with both thumbs up ! just an eloquent writer gifted with the ability to reach out to both adults and youth ! a must read
a good book that explores the star wars saga from a christian perspective without compromising either faithfulness to christian faith or to the star wars cosmology i was troubled a bit by the many errors in this book statements about biblical characters star wars movies as well as lord of the rings another book that follows a similar pathway from an angle that 's more focused on the creative aspects of star wars my own god in a galaxy far far both books are definitely worthwhile reads
contrast this with god the devil and harry potter '' and note a pattern of interpretation that points in the same direction there is one true myth it is encapsulated best in the christian myth but other narratives that employ that myth manage to lead us in the right direction as well they support it a myth is a story that confronts us with the big picture something transcendent and eternal and in so doing explains the worldview of a civilization '' xviii god for george lucas i think there is a god no question what that god is or what we know about that god i am not sure the one thing i know about life and about the human race is that we 've always tried to construct some kind of context for the unknown even the cavemen thought they had it figured out i would say that cavemen understood on a scale of about 1. now we 've made it up to 5. the only thing most people do n't realize is the scale goes to 1 million '' 6 the book is loaded with interesting insights based on dick staub 's reading of the star war 's movies great stuff
staub has an interesting way of interlacing biblical tradition from both the old and new testaments with actions and pronouncements of the principal characters in fact one might evn after reading this book conclude that the star wars series was nothing but a morality play which parallels the major morals and ethical values of much of the civilized world certain to provoke thoughtful reflection
this book is great it is definately not just for star wars fans every christian every one actually would do good to read this book it is my second favorite book behind only the bible it has helped me tremendously
peter carey is an amazing writer and theft is a charming novel about the art world the satirical insights are very apt and often hilarious and carey has a wonderful way of displaying his characters ' pretensions and foibles without belittling them somehow when i read carey i am reminded of iris murdoch and nathalie sarraute as they also set their novels in heady '' milieus of the arts and academia and were adept at skewering pretensions without losing affection
it 's no denying peter carey is a brilliant writer his flair for the nuances of the good old aussie vernacular is and his characters are always society 's but ultimately likeable souls theft a love story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read but unlike his brilliant true history of the kelly gang it seems that carey was n't sure how to end this wonderful tale and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning
michael boone a painter who has gone out of fashion is desperate to have his newest work noticed and to reestablish himself as a success michael is also the reluctant caregiver to his mildly autistic brother hugh who has a disabled yet perceptive view of his frustrated brother in theft a love story these boone brothers narrate a story of thwarted talent desperate ambition fraternal responsibility and loutish dependence which becomes a mystery of theft and love when they meet marlene leibovitz a beautiful art authenticator who may know something about a valuable stolen painting the question that this fascinating novel poses is how far will michael boone who is angry at the art establishment go to achieve artistic and emotional success where does he draw the line similar to true history of the kelly gang my life as a fake and other peter carey novels theft a love story is totally engrossing with wonderful poetic writing that absolutely flies along this book is highly recommended for everyone but lovers and inhabitants of manhattan will get an insider 's thrill as the boone brothers lurch through new york and its art scene bravo peter !
this is a smart funny exploration of one of the elements of the art world the right of an artist 's estate to declare a work authentic '' or not the questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book 's narrative structure in which the story is told through two competing voices one a defeated cynical artist and the other his demanding and cantakerous brother neither is a particularly reliable narrator but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet
a swirling canvas of art scams art history and australian attitude is just backdrop this book is really about two brothers slow bones and butcher bones aka hugh and michael boone one is mentally impaired he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by the other is an artist each by his nature must be different from the rest of the world slow bones ca n't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares and butcher though more adept is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify his art theft deals with the balance between these two brothers as they ride the seesaw of great art thefts beautiful women and the international art market i found it charming and amusing it was the first book i picked out for my book group ahead of time showing up for the meeting with six copies tucked under my arm i have to confess though that it was n't so totally beloved by all ah well
after reading a less than fully positive review by updike in the new yorker i thought is was time for a first encounter with carey 's work i am afraid i have to disagree with the old boy theft is a masterpiece in many respects theft '' is an of gaddis ' the recognitions '' again authenticity and reality get analyzed and satirized with virtuosic abandon yet carey adds a femme fatale and a helpless brother to the mix and takes gaddis 's masterful groundwork to the next level the current art world is a parallel universe of such a absurdity that any outside attempt to satirize it seems futile faithfully reading the aforementioned weekly and jed perl 's pieces in the national review you can not help but conclude that we have reached a point at which the artist has in many respects become the least important player in the game critics and is what the current game is all about as in the recognitions '' authentication and forgery are important elements of this novel 's plot line however the book fully delivers on the author 's characterization as a love story that love is on the one hand highly conditional when it comes to marlene the con artist sans pareil and '' as far as the relationship between bones and his dependent brother hugh is concerned what ensues is a carefully plotted in which bones and hugh 's voices alternate authenticity and reality may be important to the aussie brothers much less so to their entourage fame and recognition seem to be the least meaningful aspects while the carefully constructed plot justifies the price of admission many times over carey 's writing style is even more impressive in a warm masculine expressionist style the brothers get portrayed in halsian brushstrokes to me the depictions of the genesis of the authentic i the speaker '' and the fake leibovitz were truly impressive characterization of other players and their surroundings were equally great the book ends in style fame as a painter may be nice mowing lawns with your brother is priceless
first rate story i highly recommend this book
daniel c dennett is a very confrontational philosopher much like peter singer and like singer he is a strong atheist dennett will brook nowhere for what he regards is muddled thinking about anything which hides the true nature of things and for dennett natural science and the idea of evolution are the true nature of things dennett is not so crude a reductionist he blandly regurgitates the writings of scientists as a professional philosopher he is deeply aware of the overall tradition of western philosophy especially modern philosophy he is one of the leading experts in the field of cognitive science and philosophy of mind he feels that darwin 's discovery of biological evolution does not just revolutionise biology it changes everything indeed he remarked in a documentary on evolution that evolution is a more important discovery than either the heliocentric motion of the earth around the sun and the discovery of universal gravitation by newton at the heart of this revolution is the new picture of nature as neither the creation of god or as a teleological mechanism leading somewhere but as essentially an endless process of change and flux ruled by chance and natural laws over time these two things blindly produce the 'apparent ' design of living creatures by the well understood mechanisms of evolution with no need for any designer in the process for dennett this vindicates david hume 's essential arguments against the existence of god which attempted to demonstrate that the existence of a supernatural being could not be inferred from the perfection of creatures or from the structure of the cosmos dennett accepts there is a 'god ' but not the being of monotheistic religion but rather just nature or the universe in the sense close to spinoza believed it to be dennett believes evolution opens up a wonderful and beautiful vista of endless change and creativity in which nature simply makes itself out of very simple parts atoms and molecules and explains coherently and in a perfectly naturalistic way the beauty and order of nature in this sense dennett is well at home with the materialistic tradition in western philosophy pioneered by thinkers such as thales and later by democritus and epicurus the interesting thing is that the mechanistic world picture changes over time and the speculations of the ancient atomists seem well off the mark today who knows what science will discover in 2000 years time about the universe and the things in it i prefer to see science as an endless quest and in my view evolution is not the final say or answer to life 's questions while i believe religion plays a valid part of the endless quest for wisdom about the nature of things i do not feel it is right or necessary to dismiss evolution out of hand because one has a religious view of the world nor is it necessary to reject a religious view of the world if one accepts evolution as dennet and dawkins vigorously do in other books the primary strength of this work is dennett 's excellent research and understanding of evolutionary biology and related disciplines like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology while the primary weakness is when his confidence in the theory becomes rigidly dogmatic and in his rather ignorant dismissal of religion in general as a useless attempt by to explain what science now explains some of the things dennett argued for are now a bit dated as science has moved forwards but this book is essential reading for anyone curious about the philosophical implications of this scientific theory which is having important influences on how we understand human nature and being ethical questions psychology and theories of the mind and our place in the universe
darwin 's dangerous idea '' by daniel dennett is a fantastic book but definitely not for the faint of heart the book is almost 600 pages long and written in a style that requires analysis to understand my review can hardly do it justice but hopefully it might encourage you to buy it or at least to check it out of the library for a couple of weeks of interesting reading dennett a foremost philosopher of our time and professor of cognitive studies at tufts university in massachusetts says charles darwin 's fundamental idea expressed in origin of the species '' in 1859 has inspired intense reactions ranging from ferocious condemnation to ecstatic allegiance sometimes tantamount to religious zeal almost no one is indifferent to darwin and no one should be darwin 's dangerous idea cuts much deeper into the fabric of our most fundamental beliefs than many of its sophisticated apologists have yet admitted even to themselves '' he goes on further to state the fundamental core of contemporary darwinism is now beyond dispute among scientists it demonstrates its power every day contributing crucially to the explanation of facts of geology down to the latest microscopic facts of genetic engineering it unifies all of biology and the history of our planet into a single grand story '' there were so many good quotes that i wanted to underline or highlight most of the book dennett takes the time to carefully explain what darwin 's theory is and what it is not he chastises those who have tried to defend '' the theory by packaging it in more palatable form and creating a new theory when the original was just fine in fact dennett believes that all the attacks on darwin 's theory has simply made it hardier more robust in the process of explaining darwinism dennett describes how it covers so many more areas than just biology language culture memes '' and even mathematics are explained through natural selection as well what we 're left with is a richer appreciation for nature and the tree of life '' than we might have had with the mythical explanations that have come to us through religion religion is treated respectfully by dennett however he classes religion with wild and dangerous animals kept in a zoo cage or on a preserve the lion should be allowed to live so that future generations can appreciate the animal but we can not tolerate saving the animal in his natural habitat at any cost '' which may entail the death of humans or loss of other more valuable opportunities likewise religion if it behaves itself can be valuable for study and observation but it can not be allowed to exist in its wild state where human rights are made secondary to dogma where human sacrifice or murder is condoned or even encouraged even those who under the guise of religion misinform children about the truths of evolution should be condemned as much as would someone who advocated teaching that the earth is flat the future of our world depends on our children being taught reality as it has been discovered dennett ends the book by claiming that darwinism can best be described as the beast in the story beauty and the beast while having a form that appears dangerous and frightening darwin 's dangerous idea is really a powerful defender of the truths and values we cherish excellent but challenging book
dennett 's metaphor for darwinism is that acts like a universal acid upon everything it touches and that means literally everything it eats into the foundations of the hard sciences the various and rather less solid underpinnings of the social sciences the sometimes ridiculous and sometimes incisive branches of psychology and the claims made as to any potential though often simply vaporous and intentionally obscure philosophical or theological ' in the round there is nothing that it does not take a substantial bite from and that fact can not be avoided unless you merely opt for silly ignorant avoidance you either refute or run for cover ! bravo dennett then as somebody needed to say this as loudly as possible all the work we have done to understand ourselves and our origins needs to be refigured in the light of darwin and thankfully dennett is both brave enough and smart enough to take the heat and rebound the criticism from numerous sources anyway here are the facts as offered we evolved via an unguided process which while merely running dumb algorithms did n't care in the slightest that it would produce us most of our evolutionary history is bacterial nothing much happened for billions of years and then life literally stumbled onto a process by which it could reproduce itself more effectively you then find functional fit all the way up and all the way down a goal was never on the agenda there is no teleological drive in the cosmos not one single hint of it so bang goes intelligent design and bang goes creation science rather than a god of the gaps there are rather very few gaps which are in any case closing all the time and no god needed for the process in place of that we have only brute facts and a ' that is no more conscious of its effort towards any perceived result than a tournament is conscious of its overall activity life is a chemical process which does n't care about us at all as dawkin 's so aptly stated blind fortuitous luck suffering and unremitting process are exactly what we should expect from a cosmos of the kind we inhabit and that is exactly what we find when we survey our existence with an informed eye stripped of idealism religion and superstition our consciousness is a product certainly not a cause please check the evidence not the highly selective and rubbish touted by people like ken wilber or any other religious or otherwise mystical salesperson of the above stated process we are not special in any religious sense our children are not special in any religious sense and any awareness we have of life in general or of our own existence will terminate at the point of our death as it depends on our biology following dennett and all the neuroscience i can think of this is true from top to bottom the brain is the mind and the brain is a product of evolution end of story read james austin to see how spiritual experience can be related to nothing more than a function of the brain or read pascal boyer to see how religions generally are the products of darwinian evolution also daniel dennett has written a superb book although overtly polite and politically tactful in addressing the ignorant religious us right which carefully refutes religion entitled breaking the spell in that you will find a number of collated arguments which shatter religious nonsense and call it to account finally life has no ultimate meaning but only the provisional varied meanings which are nonetheless important that we give to it we live we die and nobody is out there or in there recording the event as martin rees has it we live in a cosmic habitat which has surrounded us and formed us and that is why we can relate the structure of the world to our lived experience there is nothing spooky about that so we can either paddle in an artificially prolonged mystery or notice the overt contrary evidence the choice is ours and hopefully it is just our own time while not our children 's that we are wasting coming to a solid conclusion anyway 10 out of 5 points to dennett while to any religious reader i suggest that they should get a life like i did ! SMILE the perspective from real evidence is truly magnificent and completely at least compared to the childish myths that i grew up with and managed to dump before i turned 20. as dennett asks if god made the world then who made god supergod and if then a superdupergod made supergod then who made him and onwards into the ridiculous get beyond it guys and find out out how you got here !
this is an amazing book which should be of interest to all those in the general public who are interested in science and the question where did we come from ''
all i can say is that after reading this book i had to read all of daniel 's other books very well written book and it makes you realize that no matter how well you know evolution there are some clever implications of evolutionary algorithm that you may not have considered in the past
there have been many comments on this book in the ten years since it was first published i think what carl sagan said about the book is perhaps the most accurate a breath of fresh air '' contrary to many other people i thought the book by dennett was easy to read very well written very straightforward and not some sort of heavy philosophical discussion he has lots of examples and many references to real science it even contains pictures and many schematics the basic point of the book is that despite any rumour or suggestions to the contrary scientific social religious or otherwise the basic tenants of darwin 's original ideas for the evolution of the species remains sound and it is the only viable theory of evolution if anything it has solidified its standing as a durable and accurate theory of evolution darwin 's theory as we understand it should start with a definition and here i quote a definition the process in nature by which according to darwin 's theory of evolution only the organisms best adapted to their environment tend to survive and transmit their genetic characteristics in increasing numbers to succeeding generations while those less adapted tend to be eliminated '' dennett points out in his discussions that many scientists that is those in other fields of research do not really understand this simple idea they still seem unwilling to accept the theory although adaptive change has been proven in the scientific literature through extensive dna and protein studies see for example a more recent article 7 years after the dennett book february 28 2002 nature authors nick smith and dr adam they measure quantitatively the adaptive changes there are a number of here and one being gould 's theories of evolution gould was famous and in the public eye but back behind the scenes in the evolution world among his peers according to dennett it seems that the situation was a lot more turbulent and controversial for gould dennett describes gould 's punctuated equilibrium '' theory a sort of stop start idea of steps in evolution that was supposed to overturn darwin dennett thinks that the elimination of small darwin adaptive steps was a confused and half baked idea my paraphrase this of course contains much irony since gould himself wrote wonderful life based on the errors of walcott and the burgess shale as pointed out by dennett elsewhere dennett explained to gould that he was writing the book and was commenting on the flaws in gould 's theory he met with gould and received all his publications from gould at first gould was helpful but when dennett found the inconsistencies among them gould went silent in their communications for almost a year and refused to answer questions pertaining to dennett 's questions the problem is that gould had and over the years until gould 's sudden jumps followed by periods of little genetic change were in fact toned down to just speed changes '' in darwin 's theory of small adaptive steps it was no longer a revolution in evolution by gould this dennett book is far ranging and covers many topics in genetics and evolution it is 18 chapters long and covers the subjects in a chatty style the book is not a quick read and would take about a week to read on and off 3 or 4 hours per day i read about a quarter in my first read and got excited when i got to pages 156 through 163. here starting on page 156 he describes how the first molecules or structures of life were formed he tells us about a possibly of a replicating parasitic macromolecule or a type of partial or it is likely or at least possible that first life was based on fragments of proteins and rna being attracted to silica surfaces or similar it is all very interesting especially the idea that catalysts might have increased the mathematical probabilities of interaction to produce life and that it is based on just common inorganic molecules found in the silica rich clays of earth 's streams and lakes he has numerous other topics such as the tree of life ideas about the species mendel the computer that learned to play checkers '' so on and so forth i would like thank fellow reviewer stephen haines bigbunyip '' or see my profile page and go to amazon friends for bringing this book to my attention i highly recommend this exceptional book here are some other sophisticated science books for the general reader genome 1999 by matt ridley the fabric of the cosmos 2004 a physics book by briane greene and life on a young planet the first three billion years of evolution on earth 2003 by andrew knoll and for a light treatment of genetics and society read the selfish gene by richard dawkins 1989 version updated from 1976 or the original book the origin of the species charles darwin modern library original 1859 reprinted 1993
darwin 's idea is very very simple it goes like this pass their characteristics on to their descendants which are mostly but not completely identical to their parent organisms breed more descendants than can possibly survive with beneficial variations have a better chance of surviving and reproducing however slight than those with variations slightly modified descendants are themselves organisms so repeat from step 1 there is no stopping condition that 's it that 's all there is to natural selection a simple four step loop a mindless algorithm that displays no intent no design no purpose no goal no deeper meaning this simple algorithm has been running on earth for four billion years to produce every living thing and everything made by every living thing from the oxygen atmosphere generated by plants to the skyscrapers and music created by man dennett writes that it is the algoritm 's complete mindlessness that makes darwin 's idea so dangerous dennett devotes the major portion of his book to aggressively arguing the above he reviews how the algorithm could have primed life 's pump '' eons ago and spends some time on describing evolution and biology he argues that biology is engineering and thus reducible to algorithms he also explains how simple algorithms can lead to computers that play brilliant chess and here he makes an important distinction brilliant chess does n't have to be perfect chess there is in fact an algorithm to play chess perfectly examine all possible moves and discard all moves that do not lead to a win the problem is that the number of possible moves is vast and the number of good moves is vanishingly small there is n't enough time in the universe to use this algorithm therefore software designers have developed imperfect but powerful heuristic algorithms that play merely excellent chess dennett uses this nuance to refute godel 's and penrose 's objections to mind as being something special '' something more than the result of a darwinian process having argued that mind can evolve through a darwinian process he goes one step further ethics can too darwin 's world is amoral without good or evil we have invented the concepts of good and evil and dennett ends with this he reassures us that while a mindless godless amoral darwinian process is at the root of everything we can embrace morality ethics and beauty to quote dennett the world is sacred '' vincent poirier toky
in the early 90 's dennett taught a seminar on darwin philosophy most of that college course is in this book with this page persuasive treatise dennett examines every corner of evolutionary theory some aspects of evolutionary theory are established beyond any reasonable scientific doubt other fine points are argued within scientific circles within this book all of the above are discussed in detail and dennett takes on all arguments in every case dennett leads us to conclude that in biology nothing makes sense outside the theory of evolution new discoveries may lead to shifts in the basic theory but the hope that it will be refuted '' by some earthshaking breakthrough is about as likely as the hope that we will return to the idea that the sun revolves around the earth ddi is a huge compilation of ideas although published in 1995 it is probably still the most current and most quoted popular source on evolution today it is divided into three large parts the last part being devoted to philosophy of evolutionary science if i had a criticism it would be that the diversity of its chapters is so vast that not all chapters will appeal to everyone the philosophy section will be the favorite of some yet others will not see its value i would recommend picking and choosing your subject matter out of the excellent table of contents and taking your time with this book with that in mind prepare for a thoughtful and philosophical journey and be ready to abandon your skyhooks '' darwin 's dangerous idea when applied liberally throws acid on beloved traditions but in the end it may be just what we need to preserve and explain basic values we cherish in dennett 's words this book then is for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it others are advised to close the book now and tiptoe away ''
david barrett and todd johnson at the world evangelization research center in richmond virginia have just completed the edition of the world christian encyclopedia this page reference set tells the status of christianity and of evangelization in great detail for every country people language city and province in the world together with a trove of other information statistics and resources for the in the world of missions a companion cd the world christian database is planned to follow this particular work when complete will help facilitate the analysis now missing from this monumental enterprise a truly impressive work of religious especially christian demographics there is really nothing like it in terms of sheer raw data
almost 20 years ago the initial edition of the wce was a great advanbce in religious information and statistics the second edition now 2 volumes reflects much of the change in the religious scene in the last 2 decades and that alone is worthwhile what is interesting is that the projections made ago for the year 2000 have often turned out to be 'spot on ' and this adds to the value of the work i commend this latest effort reservation and look forward to updates more frequently religion is one of the things that everyone all have it this book should be in every religious a priest who follows and studies and interacts with this world i can recommend it most heartily
professor putnam has written a superb review of the decliine of community in the united states through the end of the century he points to television urban and suburban sprawl generational change and changing work habits as being the major causes of the collapse of the american community he provides massive amounts of survey and study data to prove what most of already know americans do n't get together with their friends neighbors fellow citizens or even their families as much as they used to the presentation of the data is the best part of the book putnam 's explanations are often insightful and though he also frequently turns a blind eye to the causes of the destruction of the american community namely several decades of relentless attacks on american society the church as a staple of the community destroyed by secularism the family as a core unit of community destroyed in some places by policies that made family formation not only impossible the ban on female headed welfare households admiting to a male presence and by agitation for sexual freedom '' interestingly putnam provides evidence of the proof of the foregoing and more in some of his own data the places where social capital '' and community remain intact are the red states the very communities putnam 's academic colleagues at harvard deride day after day putnam 's cure for the decline of american community not surprisingly requires lots of government intervention putnam 's book is fascinating if you disagree with his reasoning what would be more interesting is the same data reviewed by conservatives there is no doubt that they would agree that the american community has declined but the reasons given for it and the ways to its revival would be markedly different jerr
i ca n't add anything that is n't already on the backcover putnam has detailed research showing the loss of social capital in the and insightful analysis of the implications as well as possible solutions it 's a highly readable book for academics and alike a vital read that will be relevant for years to come
this book definitely gets a little bogged down in statistics at points a couple of the chapters could have been easily trimmed down by a couple paragraphs and tables and boy are there a lot of tables however i still think this book is an important contribution to the discussion of american community versus radical individualism the other nice thing i would like to point out is the multiple positive reviews from across the political spectrum it 's not all the time that a book gets approval from the nation the national review and the economist it 's as nonpolitical as it can get despite the politically sensitive material
way too full of statistics and other sociological data for my tastes but when it points in the direction i agree with like any old ideologue it 's hard not to plug it the book is about how community activity and activism has fallen dramatically in the past fifty years beginning with the baby boomers generation and how my generation has only continued the slide the title comes from the decline in bowling leagues to bowling merely when time allows a lot of what putnam blames is tv curse you infernal tube err screen in sucking up time with only passive reaction how pretty much every other activity requires an active response and that this has caused people to stop caring he also discusses how sports have become far more spectator than participatory allowing for more tv watching the difficulty he runs into is that though published in 2000 the internet was not adequetely advanced and so is not adequetely covered for it is a physically passive activity sans porn that can be menatally rigorous or passive due to the desires of the participent but it also has engaged more people in a new pseudo conversation than ever existed before a conversation without bounds of physical place or honest presence which allows for great deception but also great forthrightness it is absolutely packed with statistics so for those inclined to that method of persuation it could be quite successful but merely on the sheer breadth of topics discussed it is worth the read
putnam has hit the nail right on the head public policy makers have taken note his constructs of 'bonding'and 'bridging ' to the broader community through social networks to add value or social capital to society have gained wide currency his research is exhaustive more than necessary perhaps to make the case for disengagement of citizens but he has confirmed empirically what so many know intuitively to be true hence the appeal of his findings his recent work with john helliwell published in the 2004 proceedings of the royal society on social capital and reported in the media as the science of happiness and the object in my own work on positive networking advances the discipline even further positive networking works it takes leadership and when done right adds social capital to the community putnam 's work is compelling his arguements are powerful highly recommended
i 'm resident in germany i like the workman cat calendar very much and all my friends like it too i think the calendar could not be better so each year i order the calendar as a christmas gift for me and my friends ! purchase and fast delivering is without any problems absolutely perfect many thanks to workman publ and amazon ! greetings from germany ingeborg vetter
workman publishing is famous for the bad cat '' calendars and the 365 kittens a year calendar if you love cats it is more than likely you have either seen these items or own them and buy them every year you can even enter the cat calendar contest and possibly see your very own cats in the calendar the following year what a fun and inventive idea ! this creates some of the best cat pictures you will find because of the wide variety of pictures to choose from each year in the 2007 calendar each picture is accompanied by lore health and care tips trivia personal information about the cat featured or breed information each picure is just priceless and you ca n't imagine how anyone was able to get six cats to sit together for a picture this alone is a miracle and more than likely one of the reasons this picture won second place some of the picture make you smile some make you laugh and all of them are filled with feline perfection my favorite picture is of two kittens watching cat tv on a dell screen there is information on where you can find the dvds to entertain your cats for hours at a time they really will watch tv if the right dvd is played my kitten meesa watches amazon imax the most for some reason asin the jaguar and the river scenes really capture her attention it was pretty funny ! rebecca review
this book is high entertaining and intellectually slightly challenging if you like satire thinking outside the and subtle humor i recommend it highly if you wondered why you had to read all those long generally depressing books in literature class this series is your reward
it 's late your spouse says turn off the light it 's after midnight '' you mutter one more chapter '' this is that kind of book and it 's lol good
lost in a good book may be a painful rite of passage for a linear thinker here in author jasper fforde 's england of 1985 people keep dodo birds as pets a special police unit drives stakes through vampires ' hearts tunbridge wells has been given over to russia in war reparations london to sydney travel time is 40 minutes by gravitube through the earth 's center air travel is by airship cheese is contraband there 's a duty on custard homo sapiens neanderthalensis has been recreated from recovered dna and now provides society with its untermenschen time travel is a reality and 249 wooly mammoths in nine herds migrate back and forth across britain so little of this parallel universe makes sense that i at first doubted my ability to finish the book but intrepidly i carried on the heroine of the story is thursday next a literary detective in department 27 of specops the national law enforcement megaforce the mission of among other things is to validate the authenticity of recently discovered works by dead authors the title of the book refers to the ability of certain trained adepts to physically enter book plots in real time much as mary poppins and her young charges were able to pop in and out of chalk pavement pictures in the film mary poppins this talent is so rare that here next is coerced by a representative by the world 's monolithic business corporation goliath to rescue his unsavory previously marooned by thursday within the pages of poe 's the raven '' in the first book of the next series the eyre affair in return goliath will restore thursday 's husband landen who has been eradicated and as if that was n't enough of a bother thursday must also thwart the imminent destruction of all life on earth by rampant strawberry flavored dream topping perhaps you can see where a linear thinker might suffer a migraine the enjoyment of becoming lost in lost in a good book is n't related to a plot because what plot it possesses is n't the word peripeteia '' comes to mind rather the joy comes from the expectation of reading what clever quirkiness the frisky imagination of fforde cranks out sort of a version of alice in wonderland indeed the cheshire cat is one of the book 's characters it 's that imagination that compels me to award the novel five stars though it goes against my grain i 'm not particularly driven to read the eyre affair but i have ordered the next in the series the well of lost plots it will undoubtedly spend time in the waiting room with the more linear works awaiting my attention until i get the urge to lose myself in a bit of benign madness
i was 'knocked out ' by the eyre affair '' and very sad when i approached the end however i learned of the next '' installments and immediately ordered them lost in a good book '' has been a wonderful read and i have been once again immersed in mr fforde 's wonderful imagination and quixotic characters i pray he keeps his health and writes quickly
if you have n't begun this series by fforde you should it 's a great fantasy novel that has many laughs and you can really root for thurday
these novels are worth the price of admission just to experience fforde 's imaginative powers plus where else can you find such a mixture of whimsy detective fiction and literary references
jasper fforde is seriously bizarre and it shows in his incredibly creative premise for the thursday next series all of these books are very well written and can stand on their own as complete novels but if you read the books in sequence thursday next 's story becomes better and better each book answers questions that i did not even know to ask and the story becomes even more satisfying i refused to loan the books out of order '' to friend because i felt that she would enjoy the entire series not just the one title that she asked to borrow i highly recommend the entire series and so far anything else jasper fforde has written
i was a bit annoyed by the eyre affair but also intriqued about the book jumping and time travel so i read this sequel and found it to be more fun SMILE that i am willing to forget my bugs with the first book the jump can happen a book between one book to another sometimes to something that was not a book at all ! just a lines of washing instruction could do the trick SMILE while the time travel with next 's father was exhilarating however there are some time lapses between the actions that were not fully explained because i found myself wondering why friday was a long way from tuesday well certainly has not happened in all my days it really needed one more day to accomplish what next was doing but guess what later on there was a dialog indicating that it has been 2 weeks well what do you know time 'slipped ' where have the days gone by but then an unexpected twist happened near the end and i was very satisfied by the play that i do n't really mind about the missing day s i admit the story still needs some polishing but the science fictional thoughts popped in it are too good to be passed by
in this sequel to the eyre affair thursday next must rescue jack schitt of goliath corporation from the pages of the raven where she left him in the previous book or else goliath wo n't bring back thursday 's husband landen whom they 've erased ! this volume also introduces us to jurisfiction the counterpart of special ops that exists within books this is wildly creative stuff from a hilarious scene in which thursday must appear on trial before the judge from kafka 's the trial to meeting a very unhappy jack schitt in the pages of the raven fforde keeps the clever puns and wordplay coming at one point thursday 's father describes an alternate universe in which world war ii ended in 1945 but most things are similar including the existence of the painter carravagggio but that is his name is spelled more sensibly there on the other hand the plot of this book feels less focused than the eyre affair towards the end we do gain some insight that ties together earlier events but takes a while in coming and this book very much sets us up for the sequel on to the well of lost plots
in a recent newspaper in one day enron chief pleads not guilty adelphia execs found guilty no retrial in stock scandal and this was just the front page of the business section on that same page i noted the use of the phrase ethically amoral '' have we finally reached a point where we can construct such phrases corruption moral relativism the meaning of is '' have you had enough if you are looking for some insights into the problem and perhaps an alternative approach here 's your book there 's no such thing as business '' ethics maxwell writes there 's only ethics '' maxwell is right and through interesting stories and common sense he argues for the adoption of the golden rule treat others the way you would like to be treated i read this book in hopes to validate my own research for my book swapping lies ! i felt that perhaps my call for a return of honor to the workplace was a bit too much too naive i was surprised to read that i am not the only one who feels this way maxwell is calling for the golden rule ! many will consider the golden rule a bit nave in today 's world yet it is principle that successfully guides us in our business endeavors a principled and focused leader is not nave in fact they are a constant source of strength and confidence to all spend just an hour to read this book it may change you and your company
excellent book simply written but loaded with information if you are tired of the ups and downs of dieting this book is very helpful
i found this book to be one of the most life changings books i have read todate the author gives you a really clear path that makes you focus on your life and you as a person the insight that i have gained about myself was really freeing i read the book through once and then i started all over again with chapter one i got a journal and i have begun writing meditating on the scriptures from the book and really learning how to connect my poor eating habits to the stressful or negative events that occur in my life i will be using this book for the next few years this book can really be applied to any addiction that a person may be dealing with
this is the last book you will ever need ! thin again teaches the reader how to deal with the inner causes of first i have never read anything like it ! it 's not psychological principles that will make permanent changes it 's the application of scripture and the healing ministry of the holy spirit thin again is a gentle treatment of the problem of obesity and i have read volumes on these subjects but this one changed my life and i am encouraged for my future as a much thinner person
i used to participate in weigh down workshop which had similar guidelines for hunger and fullness but after multiple problems i encountered with the religious teachings i dropped the program then a friend told me about 'thin again ' which was actually around before weigh down ! what a refreshing alternative and easy reading ! now i 'm back on track with my weight and !
this was a wonderful book ! this bridges the gap between spirituality and weight loss there are no formulas '' or forbidden foods '' just a lot of helpful soulful advice
i highly recommend this wonderful book ! i am a former weigh down workshop coordinator was searching for a less condemning approach and god led me to this book ! the hunger scale '' is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring uplifting and healing i believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for it certainly was for me ! it is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small group setting
yes the writer seems to repeat herself a lot in the story i almost thought there were only two characters after reading the first 100 pages but then it grew better and even more appealing towards the last 100 pages it is a decent novel and i 'm glad i read it it is not as as the two novels of anita shreve i read but i certainly enjoyed the reading
the kiss is the second book i have read by danielle steel so far it was great my first book of hers i read was the wedding i highly recommend that one both are excellent books i love romantic books they suit my personality beautifully i even have considered trying to write a love story with my own experiences real life is a lot better and more complex then fiction ever could be but i do like fiction as much as i love biography or autobiography any genre is fine by me this is an inspirational book it deals with disability and how people overcome hurdles in their path it has some touching moments some moments i adore in the hospital and one person 's strength to bring someone between life and death back to life no matter what the resulting burdens may be after a horrific car accident with a bus during one long and only everlasting kiss two people in strained marriages one with an invalid boy and daughter the other in another loveless marriage and affairs the only contact they share is moments from time to time during the year and phone calls that keep their lives fullfilled two people who love each other but can not take the next step to make their lives better and be together mainly due to commitment to husbands and wives no matter how hopeless or worthless an existence it may be with their partners yet slowly things are unravelled and secrets that have lay hidden for years are exposed i think i have made a pretty good summary of the book for people who do n't know the book i read i think it is worth reading the story seems quite simple and it is but like always i am surprised how things turned out and the marvellous twists and turns the story takes to secure danielle 's place in romantic fiction for sometime to come i would read more of her books they are lovely i wanted to read 'the kiss ' because i felt it was so perfect for me i love kissing girls friendly kisses more then type kisses i know it may sound strange but i think to fully understand it and my e mails sometimes you may have to meet me or a least listen to my voice on tape one day to pick up on some of the humour i like to inject into my e mails most of the time and sometimes how i see the world and live my life as as it is danielle steel is pretty light reading usually she 's the best ! i do n't really want to read barbra taylor bradford although i do wish they would make a movie of 'the wedding ' it would be so good it would be harder to make a movie that affects people with 'the kiss ' but since i read the book i 'd be happy to watch any resulting movies they might make i have n't seen any danielle steel books adapted to movies i 'm sure they are extreamly sappy but i can handle it i think i do n't think i will read all of her books just the ones that look most interesting to me 'the wedding ' was special because i have never been to a wedding before 'the kiss ' was good because i love to kiss girls plus i am a pretty affectionate person i also think quite tactile too i 'd take any opportunity to give someone a hug or show affection i am full of compliments usually
another romantic novel by danielle steele this time the setting is europe isabelle forrester is stuck in a miserable marriage with a wealthy and obnoxious french man who treats her really bad bill robinson is stuck in a marriage to a wife who does not care about him the two come together and over time fall madly in love one night in england together in a limousine they give each other a and kiss the kiss turns out to be a event for both of them a moving story with a happy ending
a must have for anyone who writes or teaches writing or is learning writing my 7 old grader loves this book but so do i as a writer and teacher my son finds it easily understandable and it is written in such a way it is fun for him to use as a result he is far ahead of most children his age in his writing skills what sets this book apart from other books or grammar is not only is it superbly organized but it has numerous examples which make the principles of grammar easily understood that is one reason is is useful for a teacher in that it provides so many examples for use in the classroom the book begins with the theme of sentence buildng and the user learns how to build sentences that is a valuable concept in both learning and teaching grammar i enthusiastically recommend it
i found several parts of this book exceptional meaning much better than the average grammar book the coverage of first person second person and third person writing in both singular and plural forms was including a later section on first second and third person pronouns there are also excellent sections on object of preposition and object complement yeah i did n't know what that was either the sections on pronouns are extremely complete and go on for pages i did n't realize how many pronouns and types of pronouns there were verb tenses is also covered very thoroughly with many examples of present past future present perfect past perfect and future perfect prepositions are covered very thoroughly including explanations for when they 're used to tell location direction time relationship etc and then a list of prepositions this book also has an excellent appendix with various unique parts one section covers the term ivan capp '' which is an acronym for remembering the order of parts of speech interjection verb adjective noun conjunction adverb pronoun preposition one of the appendices sections has initials acronyms and abbreviations '' which is also helpful the sections i 've described above are often in grammar books but not fully explained and it is even harder to find all of these in one book my one disappointment was in the coverage of when to capitalize which was a bit short and with few examples for such a concise book that 's still pretty good
this book it is a great help when i am not sure how to guide my kid very good just followed the rules in this book
since my original language is german it was a great help to have this book now that my daughter is a student in an american school although i understand the basics of english grammar this book showed me steps on how to teach my daughter english grammar without making it too complicated it also helped me refresh my grammar i have also recommended this book to my daughters grade teacher as an ideal companion for any parent whose kids are starting to write stories of their own
i 've recommended this book for people who want to improve the writing skill i found this book very helpful for foreign people the book contains the basic ideas and good examples
this book is a masterpiece that everyone student or adult shouild read it clearly illustrates the fundamentals of good writing and conveys complex ideas in an understandable way terban has clearly written the best grammar book on the market and every classroom should have a copy plus it is a very useful tool for highschool student studying for the sat 's or 's in writing i highly advise anyone who wishes to improve his or her grammar to pick up a copy

i loved this story line nora makes it so easy to picture every tiny detail the big italian family the restaurant they own and the small town i could n't put this book down usually i have a problem with stories that keep jumping into the future but i had absolutely no problem with this book whatsoever actually being able to watch the characters develop and grow over that time period was one of the things i liked most about the book by the end of the story i felt like i knew all the characters
i loved this story ! i am from a large italian family and i thorougly enjoyed the picture that was portrayed in this book i could picture the city and the small italian restaurant i could also almost taste the food i thought the plot was excellent and the characters were well painted i wished that the person who was the arsonist was a little more difficult to guess it was the most obvious but i highly recommend the book you could almost smell the smoke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
great story ! ! excellent in fact my beef is with the narrator and editor as someone who grew up in the baltimore area i thoroughly enjoyed the local references however it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce baltimore icons like boog 's bbq at camden yards for the record it is not pronounced ! it is do better research ! !
the loving italian family smart and capable protagonist reena hale compassionate and boyfriend and sex off the charts '' in blue smoke will satisfy loyal roberts fans however if readers are looking for the afternoon delight kind story sometimes associated with roberts this book is not for you blue smoke is harsh sadistic rape murder and a truly evil sociopathic character may put unsuspecting readers right off but after reading blue smoke i have even more respect for roberts as she shows her ability to work in yet another genre except for some minor logistical problems associated with a handgun during the story 's denouement blue smoke works it shows that talented writer nora roberts can play with the big girls of this genre reichs gerristen slaughter early cornwell et al i hope roberts keeps reena hale on hand for a few more adventures good job nr
perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers those who detested it said it was because of the violence those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts there are the usual nora roberts fixtures here a beautiful independent tough heroine sex scenes handsome and talented lovers flowers etc it has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts but there 's nothing very mysterious about it anyone who does n't know who the arsonist is after the first fire has n't paid much attention in fact i kept wanting to tell reena to wake up and go get him perhaps the biggest departure from roberts ' previous books for me at least is the rather humdrum atmosphere ambience is the writer 's strongest suit in other works alaska in winter an island off boston chesapeake bay ireland louisiana etc old baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop are n't quite the same still the writing is mostly good and i kept reading a nora roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today
i have been reading romance stories for the last three years and just as i was getting tired of them nora comes with something different ! it was an entertaining book to read i particularly liked the timeline that she did following the main characters through years to develop the story line it was also exciting to watch the two romantic heroes to narrowly '' miss each other over the years and to see them finally met in this book there is more dynamic plot than in some other nora 's books if you read black rose '' you would know what i mean it seems that sometimes nora has pages and pages of the pretty much the same stuff '' and it feels like she is just trying to fill the pages to get the book to the publisher not in this one sure there are some repetitions such as you get to read about the family being established in the community being close loud and helpful to each other but it does not get to the point that you see the same sentences over and over again and in my experience some of her books do get that i 'm glad this book was published in summer because it made for a perfect book to read on vacation and once again she did not dissapoint with a slightly different style than her other books well done
if you like books on influence that have a strong academic foundation and plenty of real world examples you 'll like this one and i loved reading it just before starting to write this review i saw something that illustrates how each of us often sees certain things differently another reviewer believed the book 's example of a car dealer 's sales process lacks the details a reader needs to design a sales process that example is precisely the one i 'd decided to mention to you levine uses ten pages to detail this process it 's a terrific practical example of getting the customer to make a series of small commitments that greatly increase the likelihood of a sale you 'll get enough info about each step and the overall process to adapt to your sales system to the extent you want most of us will choose to borrow parts of this and other processes you read about one reason is that this particular process included unsavory steps sure it will take some work and thinking on your part to improve your sales process that 's part of customizing sales systems so they work best for you interestingly the book gives the real name mike gasio of fresno ca of the salesman and notes that he left the auto sales business and became a teacher and counselor for young people mike now uses the same process of gradually increasing commitments to help these troubled youngsters make healthy changes in their lives what a great story and illustration of how we can effectively adapt persuasion tools to create either sleazy or healthy results once we have the information the choice is ours one of my favorite books on persuasion
a very intersting introduction to the psychology of persuation how everything from car salesman education religion through to cults manipulate their victims the book has certainly made me curious to find out more about the subject and i intend to read guidebooks on how to apply these principles in everyday life in other words this is an intro to the psychology but not a guide on how to apply it for example the book talks in general terms about the process that car dealerships design for persuading a customer to commit to a sale but gives not enough detail to how to design such a sales process
easy to read lots of new material does n't have a sales focus but is still a must for every salesperson an academic who does n't try and impress you with who he is this is a fine book along with hogan 's the psychology of persuasion this is one of the best d
this should be a book that every consumer should read what i find very interesting was that many of the techniques employed by sales people or con artist that was used on me was discribed step by step in this book though i did n't fall for them back then it was eye opening to see 'their ' textbook on persuading you most of the information and studies in this book are quite old but nonetheless it is still revelant today this most fascinating part for me was how retail stores and supermarkets showcases their merchandise or how simply by putting a more expensive item next to the cheaper item will generate more sales on the cheaper item sounds simple but it is n't that is why companies spend so much money on marketing and research more rational people will generally not fall for tricks illustrated in this book but unfortunately these tricks do work because there are enough irrational people out there that are susceptible to them
the first chapter is this book made me sweat i thought i would read this book to continue my study in persuasion just to make me a better marketer that i was in fact immune against most persuasion not so says the author his opening chapter about the illusion of invulnerability shook me it made me realize i 'm just as easily swayed by ads and marketing as the next person and so are you this book is a great warning a powerful education and a great research tool i 'll use it to improve the marketing i create but i 'll also remember it the next time someone trys to market anything to me great book get it read it use it joe vitale author of way too many books to list here
a quick efficient reference with the most commonly used words for students on the go
a good quick reference book but i will say that some words are not listed it is focused for grade in my opinion a handy addition for a home reference library
i use this book in my classroom it helps my students come up with better ways of saying and writing things it is quicker for them to look through than a thesaurus it helps esl students widen their vocabulary easily it also helps me when i work on papers while getting my master 's degree it is a great aid
i was a bookseller and this was one of the most eagerly sought after children 's books of its time and now that i have my own little 'alexander ' i am thrilled that it 's still not only available but doing so well it 's never too early to learn that you can have a bad day ! and alexander 's bad day comprising of no prize in his cereal friend trouble teacher trouble a cavity new sneakers in the wrong color and he ca n't find his ! and i wo n't even mention what happens in his dad 's workplace ! can happen to anyone happy reading ! your little ones will root for alexander and want to know where australia is !
i can recite most of it from memory i love it so ! i tell people about it all the time and recommend it along with alexander who used to be rich last sunday as a staple in every library it 's a great one to have even if you do n't have kids sometimes the little buggers show up for visits ! this book does a hilarious job of pointing out to kids that some days just stink and that you live through them anyway the illustations have some great humor for the adults read it aloud to someone you love ! aura mae author of get some hairapy a hairdresser 's prescription for happiness
this book is an interesting read ! it helps make you see that once in a while you may have a bad day but this gives a good example that if you 're having a bad day and just think tomorrow will be a better day children can laugh along and enjoy this book of alexandrer 's bad day cynthia marie rizzo author of julie and the unicorn '' and angela and the princess
i grew up with this book and today at the age of 22 i was cheered up with just the thought of it while having my own horrible terrible no good very bad day lets just say that this is a book that stays with you even in austrailia
my children grew up with this book and loved it now i 've bought it for my grandchild it 's a timeless gentle wonderful little story about how sometimes life just is n't what we want it to be
my daughter who is 3 just loved this book she likes to hear about how alexander wants to go to australia
this is a book that every child should read my son thought it was very funny and we enjoyed it a lot
kids can certainly relate to all the bad things that happen to alexander and they understand the importance of each from getting gum in his hair to a cavity to not even getting the pair of tennis shoes he really wanted children can commiserate with his woes from their own experiences this book is a great reminder that even though as an adult we may think it is n't a big deal to a kid it 's a major bummer and of course tomorrow is another day so things may not be so bad afterall
book 9 in the in death series this is one of my favorite books in the series in this book while eve and peabody are investigating the murders and organ thefts of victims they come across a cop with an attitude after eve gives this officer a dressing down on record the officer writes a complaint when that officer turns up brutally murdered eve is asked to give up her badge while the investigation is underway you have a very dynamic story line while eve 's inner circle support her she still struggles with what life would be like if she ca n't be a cop there are some very emotional and heartbreaking scenes also a very funny one when roark gives her some ideas for alternate jobs '' an excellent book and you wont want to put it down ! we meet troy trueheart in this book and some secondary characters really shine
generally i love the in death '' series because of eve and roarke i liked this book but i thought it was so sad when eve was suspended from duty and had to turn her weapon and badge but she did not give up she is a strong woman and i love strong women because they show real women that they can be just as strong yet vulnerable
in this series each story is as interesting as the last eve and roarke 's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring what really made this story of conspiracy in the world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters roarke feeney peabody mcnabb louise mira mavis whitney tibble they all work together to make eve dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline the mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing god with people 's lives including eve 's ! i particularly found feeney 's father figure role interesting and would love to see that developed further in future storylines thank you nora for the great stories you never seem to run out of ideas keep up the great work ! i am waiting for a movie or tv series to come out based on eve dallas and company
i was wrong ok i 've admitted it i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels were n't my cup of tea while reading conspiracy in death i realized i could n't have been more wrong i love this futuristic series ! a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas since it 's not a random act of violence this man snooks died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon when dallas digs a bit further she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc licensed companion died as the result of her liver being removed after even more digging dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen the closer she got to that answer the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became when she got too close to the truth the villain had to put a stop to her investigation the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook 's body and dallas when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas stripped of her badge and weapon the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise there was excellent character development and as usual robb aka nora roberts draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that at times it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot this is definitely one to read as all of the in death '' series books have been start with the first book when reading because robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings or you can start with the first book just because it 's the beginning of an excellent adventure !
this is one of my favorite series because it blends two of the genres i like most fantasy and mystery nevertheless i have found that in a couple of cases i feel that one of the books in the series is missing something in this one the storyline was not particularly interesting to me and i think that robb did not progress as far as she could with the development of the different characters lieutenant eve dallas is summoned to a very unusual scene a homeless man was murdered and his heart was removed with surgical precision the killers because the medical examiner determines it has to be more than one used high quality tools and have to be experts in the surgical field this creates a real problem for eve because it is hard to figure out a motive organs are fully perfected and even though rich people prefer human organs these have to be in prime condition and needless to say the ones from the victim were n't besides having to deal with finding the killers eve is faced with an uncooperative and outright confrontational female officer that will take part of eve 's energy away from the case and drive her close to desperation and doom also when her investigation leads her to the drake center of medicine eve realizes that she is very close to two of the members of the board charlotte mira her psychologist and roarke her billionaire husband robb has a very special way of presenting what i interpret as her vision of a better future through some of the features of the world in which the series develops in the year 2059. for example firearms are banned there are licensed companions who can carry their business in privacy without getting in trouble with the law and the drake center is named after the man who discovered the anticancer vaccine as i mentioned this is not one of the best books in the series and it made me feel as if robb was in some kind of schedule to release another novel for a certain date and had to go with the first idea that came to her mind maybe my slight disappointment is partly my fault because i have been expecting books in every time i start an eve dallas ' mystery this one falls a little short of the mark but there is no way around it those who have been following the series have to read it and hope that the next novel will get better
my wife got me hooked on this series and i have read it beginning with the first book naked in death some i enjoyed more that others however conspiracy in death is the best one yet ! when eve is faced with not only a complex case of someone who is using great medical skill to kill for no apparent reason but also with accusations of abuse from another cop the intensity level keeps rising
this is another chapter in the continuing story of lieutenant eve dallas and her husband with the cast of supporting characters feeney peabody mcnab mira mavis nadine summerset et the year 2059. eve and peabody are called to the grisly murder scene of a sidewalk sleeper someone had stolen the corpse 's heart when the two arrive on the scene not only do they have to confront the body but officer ellen bowers who has it in for eve as eve and peabody begin working the murder other homeless dropouts are found dead with various organs sliced out by a first class surgeon but has been obsolete for decades because of cheaper better artificial replacements so the crimes do n't seem to make any sense as eve worries about this bowers weaves her web to destroy her an internal investigation based on bowers ' complaints ends with eve 's suspension gone is her shield her identity robb may have gone a little more scifi this time with the discussions of future medical procedures and advanced artificial organs and all but she 's still given her readers a story that will keep them burning the midnight oil also it was nice that we get to see eve rely on the help of her husband and her friends rather than to try and take on all her burdens herself it made her appear more human more identifiable
i 've read all the in death '' books published so far and i have to say that conspiracy in death '' is my favorite i cried when dallas lost her badge temporarily thank goodness it was so ca n't wait for imitation in death '' to be published ! the stories get better and better ! ! yahoo jd robb aka nora roberts !
i bought this book after examining its beautiful pages various times at the bookstore last night i cooked from it for the first time it was a lot of effort but it did pay off last night i made the deviled chicken thighs my work began sunday with four trips to different stores to assemble the various necessary ingredients yep two supermarkets the liquor store and a bodega i live in jersey city just outside manhattan then the next day was the cooking altogether it took me about four hours for that part of the task honestly halfway through i seriously considered giving up but i persevered the author 's directions are very precise and very clear so i just concentrated on completing each step when i was done my kitchen smelled wonderful between peals of the smoke alarm set off by the cooking of chicken in oil and i had a beautiful and delicious meal to serve so my thoughts are this do n't pick this book if you expect a quick and easy meal to toss onto the table this is serious cooking and it takes a lot of work and dedication to get through it but wow when you are done you feel like you 've climbed a mountain and you have this wonderful meal to show for your efforts also now that i have been through the entire recipe i bet i can do it again with much less effort and pull it off again more easily meaning i learned some things about cooking while working my way through it not something you can say about a lot of cookbooks i 'm going to put this book aside for a month or so and then carefully pick a recipe and do it all again i recommend this book heartily to someone who is interested in cooking and most of all learning
i really like this book i has it all ! ! beautiful to look at fun to read and very inspiring it is set up nicely too by season so you will use the freshest ingredients for me having the menus laid out is very helpful we will have some fabulous meals from this book
this is a gorgeous book and the recipes are simple quirky thoughtful and elegant it 's perfect for someone who does n't have hours so spend in the kitchen but is looking for something new it is organized around the seasons and the emphasis is on ingredients some of the recipes are preceded by a little commentary explaining where they came from and their relationship to the restaurant knowing that i am making a dessert suzanne goin has made since childhood or a salad that was devised for a special occasion makes the process more interesting for me i love that she included mom 's chocolate bundt cake '' we children of the can relate ! this is also the kind of book that can inspire you to use a new method or riff on a recipe even if you do n't have all the ingredients pictured the flavors are indulgent but not over the top and the recipes are interesting but not too complicated that being said i 've found some of the instructions to be imperfect some of the techniques are a little fussy and some directions a little vague but if you already know how to cook and you are interested in putting some new flavors together i think you will really enjoy this book
this book is by far one of the best cookbooks i have while many of the better recipes in the book require a good deal of planning the reward is well worth the effort !
this book is beautiful full of great and fantastic recipes and most of all encouraging goin tells us that we can do it do n't be intimidated so i made the ricotta gnocchi several of the pork and chicken dishes outstanding ! buy this book
this cookbook is simply devine suzanne is right on the tip of what american cooking should be about right now her food is modern without being pretentious i love her little comments and tips before each recipe i ca n't wait to try some of the recipes
sunday suppers at lucques seasonal recipes from market to table provides an outstanding set of recipes from a los angeles restaurateur whose cooking has won her accolades since 1998. here are over a hundred of her recipes arranged into menus organized by season lest you worry they are geared for professionals or restaurant owners they 've been edited for home use and are divided into preparation tips for quick and easy reproduction and paired with color photos to encourage polished results be ready to use some exotic ingredients though chilled red pepper soup with sumac basil and lemon yogurt and spiced pork stew with polenta root vegetables and gremolata provides plenty of flavor and require access to fennel sumac and other spices and vegetables peculiar to more urban markets
i have n't had much success with cookbooks from celebrity they 're overly complicated with pages of ingredients or they 're the 'food network ' type of cookbook where one wonders who really came up with the recipes the author or a team of testers so i purchased this cookbook primarily because the recipes themselves really intrigued me they seemed simple yet unique at the same time the recipes are time consuming definately but once you make a dish once you can easily streamline the directions yourself cutting out unnecessary steps i tend to cut back on marinating and salting time for example and have n't had any negative effects because the dishes take time i 've found i 've been happiest when the end result has been unique enough to be worth the effort the devil 's chicken thighs for example were delicious and different enough from any other chicken dish i 've made that i happy to have spent the time it took to make same goes for the halibut with roasted beets and the torchio with cavolo nero both of which i made on a weeknight after work i was also impressed by the attention to detail every recipe is designed for a group of 6 something so small yet i find it so frustrating when a cookbook has quantities all over the map the directions are extremely clear and concise and i really appreciate the notes on prepping ahead a home cook with a decent level of experience will have no problem and the ingredient overviews at the beginning of each chapter are a perfect introduction to the seasonal menus a outstanding book that i love to cook from i ca n't wait for the next one !
i have n't gotten excited by a cookbook in years but sunday suppers was just the thing to get me back to the kitchen cooking new dishes i love her sense of food and her unpretentious writing also her focus on local foods from farmers and her simple ways to prepare them never too much nor too little thank you suzanne for a great book will have to say i am amazed at a couple of the pretentious reviews here i mean really start your own blog already and stick to the subject per favore
this book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by anne frank i read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and i visited the anne frank house in amsterdam it was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real i would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site
i have just finished the diary of a young girl and i have the strong feeling that i was moved back in time as if it was 1944. the diary is incredible almost hard to belive that if was written by a 13 old gilr if olny she 'd had a chance to she would have been an amazing writer the book is written so clearly that you are able to imagine almost touch everytching that 's inside the secret annex you 'll have a feeling that you are one of those 8 people who were living there for 2 years i really recomend this book for those who emphatise with the holocaust victims and also for those who do n't know much about the hard times the jews had to go through hard to belive
the diary of a young girl is an inspiring story where i learned about some circumstances and events in the time of world war 2 but this story is really about the meaning of life from a teenager 's point of writes events and stuff that she thinks while she is hidding with her family for more than 2 she says in her diary that she wants to keep living her diary then ends and she was found and was set to a concentration camp and died
a year ago i was forced to read this book by my english teacher at first looking at the cover it was red with a picture of a girl i had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it after a couple of days i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere i go during break times lunch and spend 2 full hours reading it at home reading this diary made me picture how anne had her teenage it was really different from mine nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic no other friends to talk too same people she sees every single day in a small place called the secret annexe '' can you imagine that that kind of life that you have no idea if you can eat or not if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day or if you can still get out of that annex and live a normal life again can you imagine but still they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe for me those people are the real heroes they never gave up they sacrificed and united and best of all their faith in god reamined strong this book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world this is a real story of a real world and the fact that this happens too to so many people sometimes we ask why do we need to repeat history '' read this book and you 'll realize that this is different worth it and remarkable
this was such a well written book that you would think an adult wrote to know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as anne 's anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive this book really gives a great picture of what the jewish community went through all the unjust moves against them it made me gain more respect for all religions and races this book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people we can never understand all the hardships the franks went through but we can help those going through similar persecution
it was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the nazis during wwii i highly recommend this book and i hope i can one day go see the anne frank museum where the family lived during this time
zero coupon bonds are the bonds spoken of in the book 's title zero coupon bonds do well in falling interest rate and stable low interest rate investing environments as we had 90 of the time from 1982 to 2004. now is not the time to use this book 's advice wait until interest rates fall again 2010 but it is true by not owning any stocks o'higgins outperformed the greatest bull market in history
although there are some holes they do not ruin the basic info provided i think that in trying to keep it simple o'higgins might have made it too simple in the end he shows that this is a strategy that doesnt take alot of complicated research to use and that is the true beauty it is especially relevant in todays stock market
i really liked this book the author gives you information the media ignore he even tells you what the media are really like best of all the information put forth in the book is right from scripture a for all who want to know the truth
as witnessed on his television program levitt was a master armchair raconteur he went to be with the lord april 19 and more so when sifting through end time puzzles dateline jerusalem '' therefore supplies the reader a delightful read especially those akin to levitt 's theological leanings though one reviewer has already noted agreeing with zola greatly while still disagreeing with his most important conclusion that jesus is ha maschiach perhaps the greatest test of a work is it 's staying power and this work shall be enjoyable however long the lord should tarry before entering the author 's dateline city importantly positions are firmed in regards to many of the major issues of the day including insights into his testimony the jews the muslims to name just the first few chapter headings an essayist of the first order in an age when that rank is sadly thinning levitt 's exit still leaves his projection of wisdom and courage yet needed for this hour tl farley author when now becomes too late
from keen insights into media bias to refreshing keys to israel 's proper role in world affairs dateline jerusalem is packed with analysis plus new and startling information what is the palestinian agenda will israel survive in today 's hostile climate can america win the war on terror what end times events are just around the corner after giving his testimony in the first chapter zola devotes chapters to the jews muslims palestinians the government media education churches end times and finally questions and answers brilliant book highly recommend it !
i 'm a polytheist and the author is a christian who converted from judaism those are both monotheistic religions to me they are both atheistic religions given that there is n't any difference to me between believing in one god or zero so why did i read this book because the author and i are both zionists ! and i want to see what he has to say the first point that levitt makes is that the arabs and jews in the middle east would all do well if they were to cooperate i agree they would now is the land arab or jewish i 'd advise taking note of the fact that when the levant has been heavily populated the majority has been jewish levitt says the land was given to the jews by god i do not accept that but i accept the fact that this statement is taken seriously by many jews ! and that means i can understand why jerusalem has been the jewish capital and why many jews have shown great interest in the region levitt continues by saying that jews have lived in the levant for 3500 years well before there were any muslims anywhere that 's true but it still is ancient history he also says that the archaeology of the land is jewish all but one levantine city existed in times when the jews ruled and most important the jews won their war for survival in 1967 and in 1948 i would add now what about the muslims are they trying to take over america as a descendant of muslims whose side would i be on if they tried it well i 'm not too happy about islamic intolerance and its treatment of women so it all comes down to whether we are already in a fight or if we 're the ones who are starting a fight after my guess is that we 're already in a fight with at least some muslims levitt agrees and he gives the incident of the fight over notre dame university 's attempt to hire tariq ramadan as an example what about the levantine arabs are they a famous and ancient people a nation from eons ago that merely wishes to have a state or are they simply people who are trying to attack the middle east 's jews i think the latter is the case and levitt agrees it seems that levitt is making quite a few good points ! what does the author say about hanan ashrawi well let 's just say that he seems to agree with me about her as well and levitt has some useful things to say about media bias as well as some problems academia has been having in teaching about israel i 'm not all that interested in the religious aspects of this book however i ca n't ignore the fact that many christians have taken sides some favor the muslims even to the extent of supporting terror some favor the jews and the author has some ideas about which group is making more sense i think there is plenty that can be learned from levitt 's book unfortunately many of the people who might benefit from it the most are unlikely to have much interest in reading it let alone in taking anything in it seriously
this is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a business a big big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities it is critically important to maintain visibility and that takes a concerted effort ! publicity must be part of the strategy for success and it especially important for businesses i 'm not talking about advertising i 'm talking about community visibility personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are what you do and why they should buy from you or work with you the women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big big payoff certainly all operations will not hit the one million mark but that 's not a bad goal to keep in mind ! reviewed by marion gold author of the personal publicity planner a guide to marketing you '' and top cops profiles of women in command

i was really moved by this book i felt the lose of a love in a family and the total destruction of a marriage and what could have been '' slowly slipping away from two people who had loved one another and they watched as the grew so far apart i felt for the children who saw this tragedy take place right before their eyes both parents literally destroyed what i still question is why did she ever go into the parking lot in the first place i honestly believe he only was determined to end his own life and she stepped into the car to stop him and was hit by a bullet herself i a waste of two young parents and two lost children great coverage and presented clearly thanks
most cops are criminals i really liked this book there needs to be more books like this because most cops are actually outlaws i have long said that direct action needs to be taken against corrupt cops including all options if we do n't fight back at least read more books like this one
browsing the bookstore 's section last month in search of a i had n't already read i spied an unfamiliar jacket paul larosa 's tacoma confidential the synopsis was riveting i only hoped the reading would be half as good as the compelling details promised it was but an even bigger surprise unfolded as i progressed through the first chapter larosa can write where has this guy been hiding all throughout i was keenly aware of his sensitivity to the overall politics involved and you can be sure that where the chief of police murders his wife political intrigue seethes through every line yet larosa never milks it or takes liberties or cheap shots where plenty of opportunities abound for same quite the contrary what the author does n't say divulge or speculate but only hints at speaks a lot louder understatement i maintain is extremely sexy in an author who can resist a subtext which says you 're an intelligent reader connect the dots yourself the problem with finishing a book at is you ca n't talk about it with anyone the best i could do was recommend tacoma confidential to my bookworm friends and urge them to read it fast i needed meaningful discourse there 's nothing so delicious as getting into the details of a book with other readers and discovering how totally different they may understand or explain them i appreciated larosa 's inclusion of an interesting and extremely plausible alternate theory of the murderous event toward the end of his story it 's an incredibly generous debunking of the purported nefarious motives ascribed to both of the main players the theory not only sets the conditions for healing it provokes an entire reinterpretation of the facts good stuff paul my recommendation read this book it 's satisfying on many levels a good story interesting facts absorbing characters suspenseful for sure and if good writing turns you on well that 's an extra bonus therese hercher
the detailed research has resulted in a wonderful narrative which makes a great read the sad story of these star crossed partners is very detailed and worth the price of the book
paul larosa did such an extensive investigation it was as if he was there himself watching this brutal marriage and the lives and death of david brame and his wife chrystal you ca n't put this book down for minute so much research in the details of this horrible crime from the family to david 's co workers to everyone around the both of them paul larosa is an incredible author and ca n't wait to read his next book this book is a must read
larosa has done an excellent job of presenting the facts of this tragic case in concise detail i grew up in tacoma and one of my closest childhood friends was one of the first gig harbor police officers on the scene larosa 's account of the events leading up to crystal brame 's murder and david brame 's suicide meshed completely with what was going on behind the scenes that only the police knew about at the time tackling the issue of spousal abuse is never easy it 's even more difficult when one of the parties involved is in a position of power what could have easily been a cumbersome book became a solid true crime story through larosa 's obviously words the area the people and the aftermath were vividly portrayed i highly recommend this book
i had never heard about this case so i did n't know what to expect when i started the book it immediately had a you are there '' ring to it because of the easy flow and the details and descriptions it read like a novel this is such a sad story especially for the children how sick does a man have to be before somebody notices and does something about it do these psychopathic men really hide their evil so well i can think of scott peterson of course and laurie hacking 's husband as well as others and david brame fits right in with them nobody notices the sickness in these men until it is all over and their wives are dead it is so sad in any case this was a very book and i am going to check to see if paul larosa has written any others
larosa has done a very good job of laying out the information in a balanced manner concerning a tragic incident that had a very convoluted and contentious history he also rightly raises important questions that remain in the aftermath and deserve to be asked this book is and its reading moves quickly
the brame was big news in this area for a long time i did n't really expect to learn too much new from a book however i did learn a lot the author has done extensive investigation into the circumstances of the marriage separation and relationships of this couple the book was more balanced than i would have expected too in general the story has been told with all the good on the side of crystal and all the evil on the side of david this book told the other side too in case the reader wants to make up own mind the theory at the end about how the shootings occurred was interesting and made sense to me well worth reading
this review refers to the penguin classics edition of henry mayhew 's 'london labour and the london poor ' which is an abridged version of the original four volume version published in though henry mayhew wrote several novels his name is primarily remembered as the of this journalistic work 'london labour and the london poor ' the present selection gives the best part of the original four volume book which captures exactly what the title says london labour and the people living there the selction includes some figures or statistics about the working class people such as the estimated amount of money these workers gain every day and meagre one but the most interesting part is the records about the ways of life of various lines of works in london directly taken from the people engaged in these works the jobs and some of them hardly deserve the name 'jobs ' recorded here are to name a few such as fried fish watercresses matches baked potatoes etc such as old clothes or 'dust ' like 'conjurors ' musicians or with his own descriptions about how to eat fire but the most fascinating is the records about boys and some girls who run away from parents and lives in the street of london who literally lives by begging or stealing many interesting facts are recorded by mayhew or his assistants directly from the persons the book deals with and the original words spoken by there labourers are preserved as much as possible to read or to listen to them is one of the greatest merits of the book for the languages of the interviewees retain the peculiar speeches you find in many dickensian characters and in fact you will realize that dickens did n't exaggerate when he created sam weller and the london you see here is the london charles dickens knew what did jo in 'bleak house ' was sweeping in the street who gave that permission what is the nature of 'the dust ' you hear in 'our mutual friend ' what was the regulations of the 'workhouse ' all these thing are answered in this vividly realized collections of the victorian working class portraits this book is still a valuable source for anyone who is interested in victorian period and will be buy one now
henry mayhew founder of punch magazine wrote this sociological classic during the 1850 's if you are at all interested in the victorian era in british history in london or in urban history in general this is a the penguin version is abridged and is a distillation of the best '' of the set this distillation is itself over 500 pages so imagine the impact of the entire set ! the utter destitution of the london poor is set out in such vivid detail than one can not help being shocked at the conditions human beings were forced to live in in the greatest city of its time the only fault i find with this book is mayhew 's occasional lapses into preaching otherwise a fine boo
i really enjoyed this book and thought some of the theories were monumental maybe we are just a simulation right this moment we do not know actually the vibration we are is a simulation from stillness maybe this was over all a good and interesting read some pieces were a little scientific for the layman but struggle through its worth the read
even though the book is controversial and presents ideas and theories that will appear and unproven it is still worth reading
imagine the entire cosmos conquered by nanotech machines that 's just one of the ideas to chew on in this book even if the whole theory does n't hang together a lot of the parts are extremely interesting note readers without a background in science or engineering will find this tough going
tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how god '' and immortality after death '' might make sense i only skimmed the book but i have to say that as a physicist i was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than i expected talk about having proved '' the existence of god is greatly overstated it would be more accurate to say that if certain physical conditions could be shown to hold then the existence of something vaguely like god might be remotely plausible based on his arguments but see the end of this review the compressed version of the theory is tipler as i do subscribes to the strong artificial intelligence '' belief that if you translated the dynamics of what goes on in our brains into another medium a futuristic computer in a sense it would n't make any difference our emulated '' selves would be as conscious and real as we are he outlines a scenario under which in a closed universe in the final moments of the universe there could be an infinite amount of computing that occurs so much in fact that all the human lives that ever occurred or ever could have occurred could be emulated through infinite subjective time the computing entities that exist at the end of the universe would get there via exponentially replicating intelligent machines that we or conceivably another intelligent race send out into the universe based on game theory and economic arguments he makes it plausible that the intelligences at the end of the universe would be highly altruistic and then based on quantum cosmology he argues for bidirectional causality between here and the end of the universe i have n't digested that argument not exactly something most traditionally religious folks would recognize but as a theory of how god '' and physics could be merged to my mind it 's pretty brilliant does n't mean it 's right note however that the book was written in the early 90 's tipler provides some experimental tests one can do to assess whether or not we 're in a universe where the conditions are right to make his scenario possible one of the most important tests verification that we 're in a closed universe has already been answered we seem to be in a defiantly open universe in a way that implies we are not in a universe where tipler 's scenario could hold true still very interesting reading
one of the top five if not the most interesting book i have ever read if you are familar with any omega point theories this is another one but tipler attempts to incorporate more traditionaly christian elements as opposed to hegel or view of reality i am not a religious believer myself but if you have even the slightest interest in how a traditional theology might be merged with science this book is definitely worth your attention
when i recieved the essay 's of warren buffett '' i have to admit i was disapointed i could gather the essays from buffet 's annual reports myself however the book 's organization is where the value lays the author has spliced together associated topics from various essays in a manner that makes it appear that they were part of one to begin with what results is an invaluable source on buffett 's thinking on a broad range of subjects and how some of his positions have evolved over time i was truly happy that i did not disregard what i initially percieved to be a poor purchase on my part enjoy

for all of you investors who want to invest like warren buffett that is successfully this is what you really want to read there are a large and growing number of books out there that will claim to make you like buffett here you can actually read his thoughts as wb has often said go to the source material not the analyst reports etc to make your judgments and that is true in studying buffett as well on top of that buffett is a much better writer than most of his biographers the editor of this compilation has done a good job of organizing buffett 's writings into themes with a light hand you get a good idea of how warren thinks buffett has an amazing way of penetrating the thick coating of that covers most of what passes for investment theory nowadays he ruthlessly applies ockham 's razor to cut things down to their essential truths two of the most basic are that owning stock in a company is truly owning part of a business and that the future is full of uncertainty obvious right but when you really absorb these concepts the answers to the questions of when and why you should buy a stock become much clearer i wo n't attempt to boil down any more of his thoughts you can find plenty of that elsewhere suffice it to say that although i am a chartered financial analyst and have advised others regarding investments for over 20 years when reading this book i had many moments '' where you want to slap yourself on the forehead and say of course ! '' while i first heard of wb many years ago before he was cool this book was my first significant exposure to his writings he writes well with wit and wisdom and makes fairly complex subjects amazingly accessible to the uninitiated i wish i had read this book much earlier but i 'm not sure if i would have been mature enough to put much of it into action anyway one thing to keep in mind when you hear about all the easy ways to make money from following charts or are tempted to buy the latest idea emanating from your or a talking head on cnbc what buffett does really works to put it crudely it is n't an accident that he is per forbes the richest man in the world out of over 6 billion people i have n't seen any chartists make the list yet if you are really a serious investor why would you not want to read what he has to say however i can tell you why you probably wo n't actually put into practice most of what he says it 's no fun ! it 's no fun for most reading and it 's no fun keeping your own council and avoiding the crowd also why wait perhaps for years for the fat pitch '' of a great company at a great price when you can get your kicks after all if most people were willing to wait until the odds were truly in their favor before they risked their money lotteries would disappear and las vegas would be a dusty little village even those who acknowledge warren 's achievements and study his words will find putting his seemingly obvious concepts into action surprisingly difficult but that is how you actually earn the money finally here 's a story retold by buffett that illustrates the herd mentality you must overcome to succeed i quote ben graham told a story 40 years ago that illustrates why investment professionals behave as they do an oil prospector moving to his heavenly reward was met by peter with bad news you 're qualified for residence '' said peter but as you can see the compound reserved for oil men is packed there 's no way to squeeze you in '' after thinking a moment the prospector asked if he might say just four words to the present occupants that seemed harmless to peter so the prospector cupped his hands and yelled oil discovered in hell '' immediately the gate to the compound opened and all of the oil men marched out to head for the nether regions impressed peter invited the prospector to move in and make himself comfortable the prospector paused no '' he said i think i 'll go along with the rest of the boys there might be some truth to that rumor after all '' buffett berkshire hathaway letter to shareholders 1985

most of the reviews that i have written for amazon are based on the books the dvds and the cds that i already own i occasionally buy a new product via amazon but i mostly review the stuff that i already own i own this book this play because i read it while in a humanities course in college i went to college rather late '' in life whatever that means and yet i derived more from the experience than i probably would have had i gone right after high school i am one of those people who believe that it 's not college that makes a '' indivividual but life experience if colleges and universities handed out degrees based on life experience i 'd probably have a doctorate three times over we were given the assignment of reading this play and seeing the live production that the college i was attending just so happened to be putting on with my primary focus being on philosphy i embraced the existentialism unit that we were now focused upon my best friend who an atheist '' was less receptive of these existentialist ideas he considered strange and elusive you think he being an atheist would have been more open to them than i who had already been bitten by the plague truth be told i think the only reason he says he 's an atheist is because he 's a cheapskate and does n't want to shell out extra money for christmas gifts so we go see this play and people were getting pretty agitated in this play everything goes round and round but never arrives at any final conclusions and i noticed how we as a society love our answers we are not soothed by questions and proposistions and what if '' scenarios we feel the need to latch onto something because something is better than nothing is n't it the existentialists believe that the universe is random chaotic and ultimately meaningless and so in a sense they give '' meaning to meaninglessness just like an atheist believes in you see the human species can not not give meaning to life we can not not believe we can pretend '' that life is without meaning and that we do n't believe but everything that falls onto the screen of our perception will take on the shape of our perceptions i loved this play i loved the type dialouge is n't this what we all do we get a belief so engrained in our heads and we think that it is the only way to believe and so we spend a lot of time trying to convince someone who may not be as receptive to our point of view as to why it 's valid what i have learned over the years is that the only reason why a belief is valid is because we are the ones who validate it it does n't make us more right '' than the person who does n't believe it it just makes us believers of the belief and contrary to popular opinion the more people you have who also believe the same way you believe does not prove that it 's any more valid than if only one person believed it this play did not dissolve me into a puddle of desperation and futileness in fact it added more meaning to my life which would probably make samuel beckett gag it made me fall in love even more with this crazy life that only i can live nobody lives by proxy each of us are liberated and imprisoned by our beliefs the best we can ever hope to be is determined by what we are willing to believe at any given time this is why it 's a good practice to sit down and journal about your beliefs from time to time and question why you still believe what you believe you may have outgrown certain beliefs certain ideas certain ways of being in the world but do n't be like the two bums '' in the play do n't keep postponing what it is that you eventually desire to see see it now live it now be it now if you are going to be an atheist be the best atheist you can be if you are going to be a christian be the best christian you can be if you are going to be an anarchist be the best anarchist you can be just do n't think that everyone is going to believe exactly as you believe and do n't make others wrong simply because they may have another point of view in the end none of us truly know what 's on the other side yes we 've had people with near death experiences but nobody has ever come back after being completely dead with a report we just have reports from people who have been mostly dead '' take life with a grain of salt and enjoy the ride peace blessings
waiting for godot was dubbed a tragicomedy '' and there does n't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play the random and wandering personalities of vladimir and estragon the main characters lend an amusing air to the entire work however their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy and irritation though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you unless one goes into waiting for godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be knowing a little bit about beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own what i love the most about this book is beckett 's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality vladimir and estragon are most certainly not your average joe but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous waiting for gogot is really what you make it because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale go in looking for a meaning and knowing how beckett means to get things across and i think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold a short read and worthwhile i would say at least for its originality and humor
samuel beckett 's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them is godot god are didi and gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering waiting for godot in proper modernist fashion strips away all the layers of narrative and form and leaves nothing but the naked husk of a play which beckett no doubt felt revealed the human condition at its most basic but the play 's power does n't really come from that rather what makes waiting for godot so compelling is its wide applicability it 's a story about random oppression brutality and dreams deferred by harsh realities it has been performed as an allegory of apartheid south african the jim crow south the horror of the war in bosnia and about every other possible situation imaginable why because as benjamin kunkel pointed out in a piece in the new yorker not so long ago n ot everyone has a god but who does n't have a godot '' beyond the metaphysical implications of the play though it 's popularity stems from its for all the philosophical meaning people see in it the action progresses with virtually no direct reference to it and every line which seems to suggests some sort of grand significance has a very concrete meaning in the action take the infamous opening estragon the first of the tramps struggles to pull off his boot to relieve his swollen foot unable to get it off he gives up and announces nothing to be done '' vladimir wincingly wandering onto the stage and grasping at his crotch precious few readers and actors for that matter seem to grasp that one of the play 's running jokes is vladimir 's venereal disease which causes him immense pain when urinating thinks estragon is commenting on his own ailment and announces i 'm beginning to come round to that conclusion myself all my life i 've put it from me saying vladimir be reasonable you have n't yet tried everything ! and i resumed the struggle '' on the one hand the lines relate concretely to the action of the play on the other they have become representative of modern man 's ambivalence towards a cruel and uncaring world and such clever cynicism has linked beckett to the french existentialists in whose circles he moved after the second world war but seen merely as declamatory statements of cynicism the lines lose all their power beckett 's achievement comes from his ability to link such nihilistic sentiments to extremely comic moments and it is the humor that carries the reader or the theatergoer through what would otherwise be an unbearably cynical play steve martin who played vladimir in a famous 1982 production at the lincoln center in new york put it best when he said that he sought to serve the humor of the play because the meaning could carry itself but the humor could not that 's a lesson which sadly precious few theater directors seem to grasp but which the careful reader discovers in beckett definitely a but read it before seeing it because few productions do it justice
some think waiting for godot is an argument for existentialism others believe it is about man 's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question neither seem correct in short this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language to strip life down to a mere game of waiting that is in essence what this is all about we have two characters vladimir and estragon who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up they do n't know why they do n't know exactly when he will be there still they wait eternally by the tree by wherever they think he said he would show this is n't an absurdist play although it has been labeled as such absurdism though seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece we oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story but with waiting for godot we have a simple theme waiting the two characters symbolize nothing they are quite simply not waiting to be analyzed they become in effect victims of samuel beckett 's own game they are his quotation and he only says what needed to be said at the time and so he wrote it whether people would catch on or not whether they would label it absurdism or not if you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud very slowly word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion you would probably capture the idea if it 's any indication he wrote everything in french first his second language and then translated it in to english just so it can be simple i do n't assume of course that this work should be cherished simply because it 's an exercise in simplicity but i submit that it should be cherished because it 's a genuine themeless somehow masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant unknown thing that may or may not ever come it is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous but somehow it manages to charm it is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again and it has no lyrics and no meaning as far as you know but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity
waiting for godot is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value in this case however what is behind the artwork is a the impossibility of creating a masterpiece after the monumental impossibility of joyce 's finnegans wake what remains for the serious artist waiting for godot is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world in that sense this play is the last masterpiece of high art '' the torch has now passed to movies and popular forms many critics have tried to convince us that waiting for godot is very funny and entertaining i remain skeptical there are a few moments of wry humor but not enough to make up for the emptiness of waiting '' there is literally nothing to be done '' in this play waiting '' is a what 's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant there 's something like an alienation effect '' or a defamiliarization '' as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful why is there nothing to be done '' is it simply because it 's all been done before or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning in many ways waiting for godot is a reaction to the holocaust and hiroshima the characters who have something to do '' in this play are pozzo and lucky who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world
samuel beckett 's soon to be classic drama about two men vlad and estro transcends drama beckett 's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic literal story most drama should be seen on stage so that the performers can give their characters shape bring in an audience and produce a night of dramatic arts that is not how this story seems to go not at all indeed beckett 's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor here are two men both obviously at the end of their ropes but each keeps this asinine hope that godot '' will show up but he never does extra characters like pozzo and lucky simply add to the intended confusion as several previous reviewers have taken note there is not action while this idea is spurred by the threepenny opera '' beckett takes postmodernism another step further the characters ' are so disillusioned the question becomes godot is n't coming so did he ever care could godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state a fantastic read and one of the best dramas ever written this fairly short play should be read by everyone
many readers of 'waiting for godot ' obsess about the identity of godot and whether he represents god or any other almighty being it is unlikely that beckett was referring to god as the man for whom the characters are waiting as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in beckett 's theatre although beckett was not referring directly to god the name is not without importance godot is seen as a messianic being by the characters who will bring salvation for those who believed he would come the wait for god is not represented by the play but is used as a template 'waiting for godot ' is essentially a sustained metaphor for how most if not all human beings spend their whole life waiting for something that is n't coming beckett was not able to identify godot because of the subjective nature of such a being as critics have written this play is a written test and a failure to see any coherent meaning says more about the reader than the play this is yet another example of beckett 's chilling insight into human nature and his readiness to state what others are unwilling to accept
waiting for godot a play about two men who can not communicate and always wait for something that never comes attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with it is a call to action this play is packed with nonsensical dialogue the plot does not exsist yet once we realized that waiting for godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense at least in subtle ways much of the play can not be interpreted in any finality but that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century it 's enigmatic a puzzle of words poetry and philosophy i recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge the play is short and does not take too much commitment take a quiet evening and give it a shot what are you waiting for
dave kindred has done lovers of sports and history a favor with sound and fury using two cultural giants mohammad ali and howard cosell he has produced a fresh and readable social history of the latter half of the twentieth century let me be clear i love ali kindred refers to him as the most influential sports figure of the last century in my mind he understates the case ali is the most influential person of the last century cosell on the other hand may have hesitated to tell you he was he was not trained as a lawyer and gifted with the ability to articulate complexity he brought a thinking man 's view to radio and television sports journalism individually they were interesting together they were hypnotizing they produced controversy drama and comedy almost every time they appeared together dave kindred tells the story of this alliance from a unique perspective as a newspaper and magazine sports columnist with nearly 40 years experience he covered ali 's early fight days as a reporter for the louisville before moving on to the the atlanta courier and the washington post he draws upon his experiences to the story in ways i have never seen attempted the result is a fascinating portrait of two outsized figures their heroics and their demons drawing on personal observations fresh reporting and interviews kindred writes a treatment of two lives that together changed sports television and i would argue the world forever
sound and fury 14 hours 11 cds unabridged blackstone audio is a duel biography of howard cosell and mohammed ali sport writer dave kindred knew both men he has written a bio that transcends his knowledge of both men his text is an honest no hold barred warts and all biography when a third person like kindred writes a biography he tends to put his personal touches with his own bias this book is not book showed an unlikely partnership created by media hype in the audio narrative hands of dick hill this audio project seems more like a docudrama in its scope hill 's narrative voice takes on verbal personas of cosell and ali without mocking them his talent has grown from the days at brilliance audio sound and fury is an amazing production you wo n't forget it audio long after you heard it bennet pomerantz audioworl
david kindred has written what amounts to a duel biography of the controversial odd couple that is muhammad ali and howard cosell the author tells us that ali elected to not join the military because the muslim nation told him not to to cross them was to literary toy with his life the assassination of malcolm x being used as an example while not necessarily agreeing with ali 's decision cosell supported ali stating that taking his heavyweight championship away from him without any semblance of due process was completely wrong there appears to be evidence that cosell may have already been experiencing dementia when he came out with his second book entitled i never played the game aware of the criticism in his book of his cronies in the tv booth for monday night football cosell was asked before publication whether he wanted to include these strong opinions since he always prided himself on telling it like it is '' he felt it would be hypocrisy of him not to do so now cosell was a devoted family man while ali ventured into nocturnal delights it was hard for sports fans to be neutral in regard to either of these men but boxing was the ingredient that brought these two men together first in mutural respect and then in friendship incidentally page 247 has a hilarious anecdote of howard using his colorful vocabulary in breaking up fisticuffs involving teens in kansas city whether you are a fan of either man or the part they played in sports you will find this to be an extremely enjoyable book to read
howard cosell and muhammad ali are american icons one turned sports broadcasting upside down the other energized and stylized sports in this country both displayed extraordinary courage and conviction both were one helluva lot of fun ali is one of my heroes and i 'll never forget the day i met him and shook his hand i never had the privilege of meeting the late cosell but greatly admired him cosell in fact was the type of personality you could both hold in high regard and poke fun at simultaneously that voice ! that somehow lovable pretense ! growing up in the 's as i did in berkeley no less ali and cosell provided diversion from the weighty issues of the day ali the flamboyant and brilliant boxer cosell the outspoken trailblazing sports broadcaster and commentator yet both like so much in that tumultuous decade stood for something ali risked jail by standing up to the draft and was unjustly stripped of his livelihood he 'd already embraced islam and stood for a new kind of black athlete who as we said back then did his own thing '' cosell tackled such issues as the injustices visited upon ali and others championing the causes of the oppressed it would not be an overstatement to say that cosell was the edward murrow of sports in sound and fury '' sportswriter dave kindred tells the tale of these two who played such key roles in one another 's lives many sportswriters even ones who write books are quite frankly hacks but others are practiced wordsmiths who know how to tell story with economy and grace fortunately kindred is most solidly in the second camp in sound and fury '' kindred has the huge advantage of having been around both his subjects at the very times they were making news he brings this personal perspective along with a thoroughly done research job to fully illuminate the story much of what kindred tells of ali is familiar to those of us who followed his career yet he manages to bring new material and offers some of the old from a new perspective what i particularly enjoyed was some of the back story about cosell being unfamiliar with almost all of it we follow ali from his boyhood days in louisville through his boxing career political stands return to boxing glory and his failed attempts to thwart father time we start with cosell in his brooklyn childhood early love of sports law career coincident with his determination despite that nasal new york jewish twang to break into broadcasting next are his big breaks including monday night football and of course we see where the twain met beautifully playing off one another in one of the best unscripted shows in tv history for anyone interested in either ali cosell or both and if you like one you probably at least appreciate the other sound and fury '' is an absolute must
the praise given dave kindred 's book sound and fury two powerful lives one fateful friendship '' on its back cover does n't even begin to do it justice this '' of muhammad ali howard cosell and the partnership between the two is a wonderful book and a novel concept that only a few had the knowledge connections and talent to write thankfully for all of us kindred has two books on ali stand out for me thomas hauser 's defining muhammad ali his life and times '' an oral history that kindred rightly cites as generating relevance for ali more than 10 years after his retirement and david remnick 's majestic king of the world muhammad ali and the rise of an american hero '' which chronicles ali 's rise in the context of the period during which it occurred in his acknowledgements kindred admits that he had wanted to do an ali biography but was overwhelmed by all the current work so he offered to do one on cosell his agent suggested a biography of both great agent '' is the author 's comment on that suggestion kindred a longtime sportswriter for the washington post the atlanta and the sporting news among other publications knew both men well how well in his introduction he describes a scene in which he crawls into bed with a naked ali in order to get a list of the names in the fighter 's entourage then segues to a scene at cosell 's house on long island in which the broadcaster emerges from his bedroom in his underwear sans toupee and flexes his muscles to show off to the author kindred has a genuine appreciation for both men but his book is far more than an homage to their greatness the author paints a balanced portrait of both as flawed human beings who rose to fame together in the turbulent both minorities who dealt with persecution and rose above it despite their most obvious differences age race religion marital history and looks they had a great deal in common first they were both driven by their own insecurity ali then cassius clay was driven to the black muslims by the sense of belonging they gave him even as the group was undergoing a philosophical split that would result in malcolm x 's murder his proclamations of his greatness before the cameras were driven by as much as showmanship cosell was a perfectionist who feared the worst before almost every broadcast but managed to deliver every time his selection for monday night football '' the gig that cemented his celebrity came only after a series of calls to badger creator roone arledge which finally drew a return call and this hilarious ensuing exchange arledge get over here as soon as you can there 's something i need to talk to you about '' cosell ahhhh from the desperation of your tone i can only conclude that the bon vivant who is roone pinckney arledge is beseeching me to rescue the trifle he 's devised for monday evenings am i not correct '' arledge as always howard '' cosell and you no doubt expect me to shoulder this stygian burden without additional compensation '' arledge yes howard i do '' cosell i accept '' yet for all their haughty speech and insecurity both worked to get where they were ali fought his way out of the jim crow south took out perhaps the most feared champion of in sonny liston took on the government over the vietnam war regained the heavyweight title twice more and retired with five career losses three of which came in his final four fights when his body had already begun deteriorating and he was going for the paycheck he is one of the most beloved men in the world cosell put himself through law school joined the army during world war ii directed his own early work jumped to television at precisely the moment it was taking off in the national consciousness and had a sixth sense of where to be when a major story was breaking so that his was the first voice you heard when you needed information followers have called him one of the three c 's of television '' carson cronkite and cosell so often cosell 's path intertwined with ali 's a political liberal cosell defended ali 's right to take an stance though cosell was careful not to adopt the same public stance himself he read the fighter 's statement announcing that he had refused to enter the service cosell was the first to reach the new champion upon his miraculous dispatch of liston he attended every ali fight thereafter except the former champ 's loss to trevor berbick and shared numerous interviews along the way probing ali 's thoughts and intentions their exchanges were often playful occasionally serious always memorable both fell from glory at roughly the same time ali 's final fights were money grabs to support himself after divorces the black muslims and who had taken advantage of ali 's good nature had drained much of the champ 's bank account he refused to train seriously and was beaten soundly by leon spinks larry holmes and berbick cosell who helped establish monday night football '' as an american tradition left it bitter with his broadcast partners and done in by a scandal in which he had ironically called washington redskins receiver alvin garrett a little monkey '' the man who did as much for racial equality than anyone in sports was wrongly labelled a racist but no one could overlook his increasingly boorish treatment of his broadcast partners and his rants directed toward the hypocrisy he now saw in sports heroes are the people we wish ourselves to be at least for a while and at their best both muhammad ali and howard cosell filled the bill we wish to see the ali who danced around the ring as a youth who outran liston outsmarted george foreman and outlasted joe frazier we wish to see cosell on the television describing the boxer he knew best or uncovering the story behind tommie smith and john carlos ' olympic protest or opining on reggie jackson 's dramatic homers or lynn swann 's acrobatic catches most of all we want to hear them for both were masters of language ali 's street poetry and proclamations that somehow became reality made him more intriguing than any athlete of our lifetimes cosell 's polysyllabic hyperbole could n't obscure the truth or conviction from the words he spoke and brought him at least a grudging respect we want to hear them again at the top of their profession perhaps together in a boxing ring or a tv studio but cosell has been dead nearly 11 years and ali is stricken by parkinson 's disease that has rendered him mute it has taken another man with a gift for language dave kindred to restore them to us d
may your feet always be swift may you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift may your heart always be joyful may your song always be sung may you stay forever young forever young forever young may you stay forever young bob dylan 's song forever young serves as one of dave kindred 's melodic themes in his wonderful book sound and fury '' sound and fury is a biography of muhammad ali howard cosell and the relationship between them sound and fury carries the reader along as muhammad ali born cassius marcellus clay and howard cosell born howard william cohen burst like stars upon the public 's imagination in the and takes them through their respective heydays and then to their inevitable fading away kindred a sportswriter for close to forty years began his newspaper career at the louisville courier in muhammad ali 's hometown he covered ali since his earliest days his glory days it also seems he was one of the few print reporters that howard cosell respected and liked they stayed in close touch with each other until cosell 's death but although it is quite clear that kindred admires and respects both men and with feelings toward ali that are powerfully affectionate even loving sound and fury is no hagiography the book takes us quickly through ali and cosell 's early days as kindred alternates between ali and cosell 's struggle for success in their respective fields one can see the similarities between the two particularly a determination to achieve their goals ali and cosell came together in the public imagination after ali 's conversion to the nation of islam and his decision to refuse induction into the army after being finally classified as ali 's famous line i ai n't got nothing against them viet cong '' made him something of a marked man ali was stripped of his title denied the right to box and convicted of draft evasion a conviction later overturned by the supreme court cosell was one of the few to stand up ali and it was this stand that helped make cosell as controversial as ali kindred does an excellent job covering the evolution of the symbiotic relationship between the two men kindred points out that cosell was always very careful never to endorse ali 's views about religion or the war in vietnam rather cosell always made it very clear that he argued only that ali had a fundamental right to hold those opinions and no one had the right to deprive him of a livelihood simply because he held unpopular views kindred for all his respect and admiration for both men is quick to point out those instances in which ali and cosell acted badly ali 's treatment of his original religious mentor malcolm x after malcolm was tossed from the nation of islam and then killed is covered as is his brutal and unfair characterization of joe frazier calling him less than a man and an uncle tom when in fact frazier had grown up in greater poverty and experienced more racism than ali had kindred does not hesitate to take cosell to task for his vaunted insecurity and his callous treatment of those around him particularly print journalists whom he considered to be inferior beings kindred 's coverage of cosell 's stormy tenure on monday night football is both informative and balanced kindred is at his finest in describing the twilight of each man 's career ali 's descent into a parkinson 's syndrome induced shell of his former self and cosell 's withdrawal into retirement seclusion after the death of his beloved wife emmy and eventual death kindred comes close to capturing that which can not truly be captured the ineffable feeling of loss that someone experiences when time has passed them by this feeling must be particularly intense in the case of those who once were the center of worldwide ali and national cosell attention that indescribable notion is set out in the second melodic theme that marks sound and fury '' cosell 's favorite poem one he recited at length with or without prompting was keats ' ode to a nightingale and one which kindred cites often in his book if dylan 's forever young serves as a theme for ali and cosell 's early days keats ' ode serves as a mournful and extraordinarily apt coda fade far away dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the fret here where men sit and hear each other groan where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs where youth grows pale and and dies dave kindred has written a wonderful account of ali and cosell and their lives spent at the intersection of sports and the media it will satisfy sports fans and non sports fans alike it was a great read
this is the first book by kindred that i 've read i knew of him mostly as a columnist for the sporting news who seemed to dislike everyone and everything especially anything new or unusual but i have always been fascinated by both cosell and ali and was willing to give this a shot this is one of the best sports books of recent years cosell and ali as individuals and their relationship which in reality took place almost fully onscreen is covered in full but the author also shows these incredibly complex characters warts and all as they maneuver through their respective careers ali was never more alive than when he was in the ring or training for a fight that is why he as so many other fighters was loath to leave the life he loved fought for several years more than he should have and of course paid a dear price for it the fact that he may be the most beloved human on the plane today owes more to our society 's need for heroes than anything else ali is no longer able to cheat on his wife s turn his back on his friends since his current spouse controls his schedule or be manipulated by religious leaders and businessmen with their own terrible agendas since he has little income there is little need for the con artists of the world to carve out their pound of flesh now we can project all our own ideas on to this man who reportedly spends the bulk of his day in prayer harmless to all cosell having passed away years ago can be looked at in a much more balanced and subjective manner now than when he was alive his combination of ego and insecurity was toxic to most who associated with him apparently but there can be no doubt that he deserves to be considered a groundbreaker and a risk taker while the rest of american media villified ali for attempting to evade the draft cosell sided with the boxer this and other events recounted by kindred show cosell as compared with his contemporaries at least to be a man of courage vision and conviction the fact that he became a casualty to his own ego later in his career ex trying to become a news anchor distancing himself from the sport that made him famous once ali left the scene the bitter jealousy aimed at his mnf cohosts does not reduce his greatness a wonderful moving work that will not make you want to nominate either cosell or ali for sainthood far from it but instead will provide the reader a deeper understanding of both as well as the times they lived through
kindred is a wonderful storyteller in this very readable dual biography of two controversial men muhammad ali and howard cosell like beyond glory '' by david margolick which tells another story of a white man and a black man linked by history in the 1930 's sound and fury '' is a history of a later era the chaotic 1960 's and a history of two outsiders margolick makes clear that their relationship was less of a friendship and more of a partnership the two of them never hung out socially but each saw the other as a genius in their domain who could further their respective careers this book is a wonderful introduction to their lives for any reader who was born after the time when muhammad ali and howard cosell had already come and gone and as a reminder to those of us who were there
for those of us who grew up in the and the sound and fury is a wondrous of the period through the lives of two unlikely partners howard cosell and muhammad ali it is not a boxing book it is a work of social history responsibly reported and told dave kindred 's superior writing and interviewing have made a book that should last for many years the tales of cosell 's and ali 's lives each and their accidental friendship will impress even the most jaded sports fans and grownups i could not stop reading this once i began
never read anything like this much like i 've never read anything like house of leaves much like i 've never read anything like only revolutions conclusion mark danielewski is the best writer going today
one of the most compelling parts of the brilliant house of leaves '' was appendix ii part e the whalestoe letters '' but is it worth getting the novella if the original book already has the whalestoe letters '' yes frankly mark danielewski did a brilliant job expanding the letters and characters in the original appendix where a mother 's devotion turns out to be the tip of the iceberg the book compiles the letters from pelafina to her son johnny truant pelafina is in the whalestoe psychiatric clinic although at first it is n't clear why she sends doting poetic adoring letters to her young son who is being raised by an abusive foster father but when pelafina stops taking her medication her mental state deteriorates she becomes paranoid hallucinates and sends bizarre nonsensical letters and limericks to johnny including a jumbled one that is made up almost entirely of forgive me '' but even when the doctors manage to pull her back from the brink pelafina 's desperation consumes her letters '' books are usually disasters because the authors can not put enough feeling and energy into the letters mark danielewski is definitely the exception this correspondence is enough to inspire plenty of pity and horror all the worse because this sort of thing happens in real life danielewski plots the story almost like a mystery dropping little hints during pelafina 's more sane moments at first she seems normal if a bit overdevoted but as she spirals into madness we see just how mad she is the things she has done before her institutionalization and the terrible event which caused johnny 's father to have her locked up this edition is somewhat different from the original whalestoe letters '' since danielewski added in some new letters these flesh out both johnny and pelafina and give background to her mental illness danielewski is brilliant not only with plots but characters as well pelafina is the proof she seems normal at first but her chilling insanity comes out in little spurts until we find out what she did and yet you ca n't help feeling sorry for her no matter how disturbing her manic love for johnny is disturbing and bittersweet the whalestoe letters '' are a good accompaniment to house of leaves '' and a good illustration of just what a great writer danielewski is
i 've read house of leaves twice and neither time i felt like i was able to get through pelafina 's letters however it was much easier to read all of them in the whalestoe letters perhaps because they are all included in proper sequence the introduction is nice as well
many great writer 's from kurt vonnegut to lovecraft have taken elements of there stories and used them again so you ca n't criticize danielewski for that and of course it 's not going to be as good as house of leaves house of leaves had more to it it is a good book as a sort of sidestory to house of leaves
overall i thought the book was good it starts at the basics explaining aperature film speed etc a good overview of all the different types of photography landscape portraits etc is also included the only complaint i have is the book is a little dated the majority of the book covers film cameras with only a small section on digital cameras however i just bought my first digital slr and many of the features it has are just like the older film cameras the book describes so it was still relevant
a few weeks ago my digital camera quit working at a very bad time i had to break out my twenty year old film camera and use it i was stunned at the quality that my old yaschica had over my digital camera so i bought this wonderful book and never looked back it is filled with great tips that are easy to understand tips on how to use differant lenses filters and film not to mention great flash tips that almost eliminate red eye my wife and friends are amazed at the quality of some of the pictures that i have taken plus digital pictures wo n't last but a few years stored on disk and a negative is almost forever so if you want your memories to last a lifetime break out the old film camera and buy this book ! ! ! !
excellent book for beginner photographers or even for persons who would just like to take better family or vacation pictures
this is a wonderful book for starting in photography it 's only problem is that even in its latest edition it treats digital as a new technology that has yet to enter mainstream it just dates itself in several ways such as saying that aps is also a new technology really the techniques it gives are wonderfull no matter what its just the equipment guide to 'choosing a camera '' that needs to be updated
i bought this book because i just bought a canon and wanted to learn the basics to take advantage of the features of my new camera prior to this book i have no idea what aperture or depth of field mean i finished this book in one sitting very easy and engaging book to read for beginners i like how it covers many of the common scenarios such as shooting at night shooting at and when to use manual adjustment to accommendate difficult shots i can say now after reading the book i feel confident to take on the many features of my camera and i 'll definitely come back to it for reference in the coming days
this the one book that taught me more about how to use my slr than the camera 's manual itself the step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography i also liked the way frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter one take without the filter and then the same one with a filter also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field an encompassing book the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment the peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown a good buy and money well spent my only gripe is that i preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
this book made me realize we must not forget and we need to boost our information gathering procedures we are not isolated and we need to be aware that our world has changed forever after
the looming tower is a very good book about the modern beginnings of islamic radicalism the book 's timeline starts in 1948 with the banishment of an egyptian to america and progresses to the childhood of ayman and osama bin laden and their transformation to islamic fanatics wright presents some of the individuals pursuing al qaeda including one who wanted to kill bin laden but was denied and another who wanted to arrest him i watched the interview with lawrence wright on and after reading his book was left with the opposite impression about the war with islamic radicalism his take was that we are creating more terrorists by fighting them while my belief that radical muslims are motivated more by idealogy rather than as a result of our actions or any other country 's was reaffirmed it seems that they are driven by a desire to bring about worldwide islamic domination this book is well researched and easy to read i enjoyed this book for the history of al qaeda and would recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about islamic radicalism
i bought this book to get a better understanding of the movement the muslim religion and the politics of the middle east despite being a learned person in some areas and somewhat knowledgeable in others i must admit that i knew very little about the middle east its countries and history this book was a starting place for me it explained the birth of in brutal arab prisons the life of osama bin laden his growth into a rebel and then an extremist and finally to the lack of communication between the fbi and cia which helped to lead up to the travesty of september 11 2001. i must admit that i would have to read it again to absorb all of the details and i might lawrence wright has written an excellent and readable book i highly recommend it
i can not laud this book too highly it is meticulously researched and intelligently presented you will be astounded stunned maybe did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in boulder co can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the world trade center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose iv bottle was attracting soviet bombers well you will if you read this and that 's just the start
someone had just sent me a documentary film called loose change '' which makes a case for the us government being responsible for blowing up the world trade centre this book blows that little theory right out of the water extremely well researched and foot noted the author goes into great detail about the backgrounds of all the persons involved in plotting and even back to those who developed radical fundamentalism long ago and passed the ideas on to this generation i felt that the author was very even handed in his portrayals of all concerned and spent much time laying out the whys and wherefores that pushed them into becoming the radicals that they are an excellent read i could scarcely put it down
i found this to be very well researched and full of interesting information however it took a lot of concentration to keep all of the carachters apart i learned much about how the militant terrorists justify their actions and was dumfounded by how poor the cooperation between our anti terrorist agencies was definitely worth the effort to read it
book and it 's amazing to trace the formation and progress of al qaed
a must read for anyone who wants to understand well written objective and factual it 's the scariest book i 've ever read this is a warning and we must take heed
this book is divided into short reviews of various historic sites across the us it 's a great learning experience to read about some of the sites loewen gives the history of the site including why it was established and often what the politics were at the time there 's some amusing information about misinformation that the sites portray i have truly enjoyed reading this and because of the way it 's set up it 's easy to read in short bursts when you just have a few minutes
did you know that in language backdated from the mccarthy era helen keller was a '' a communist sympathizer well no because that would n't be so edifying but it 's the truth she even sent lenin a letter congratulating him on the russian revolution and this alabama native was also a strong supporter of the naacp of course you wo n't find either one of those facts mentioned at her historical site home nor will you find the possibility of president james buchanan 's homosexuality mentioned by guides at his home in lies across america loewen tours our country 's historical sites markers and monuments knowing they likely have history wrong to see just how wrong they got it and why and of course understand what america really is requires that we face why our society has covered up suppressed or distorted so much history
lies across america what our historic sites get wrong is an excellent book by james loewen he starts first with the western half of the united states since most history textbooks start with the eastern side all of the information about historical markers is broken up into small sections for easy reading loewen proceeds to give accounts of historical markers and their errors or in some cases their silliness many of the markers honor people as heroes who were in fact overt racists other markers are notorious for telling one side of the story most of the markers in the south dealing with the confederacy are found to slant towards confederate sentiments or just to omit what really happened at historic confederate sites we also find out that many markers dealing with native americans would refer to them as savages or other racist terms in many instances i was appalled by the honoring of people like jeffrey amherst in massachusetts who intentionally initiated the spread of smallpox among native americans to exterminate them from the landscape loewen also points out our country has never been able to come to terms with gay or lesbian leaders and honor them you can take a tour of willa cather 's original home in nebraska but never once hear anything mentioned about her being a lesbian another instance of outright silliness is when plantation homes talk endlessly about silverware while you tour them but fail to mention anything to do with who built the homes did the work there and were held in bondage to the owners these are just some of the things that you 'll find contained in this book this book is very thought provoking and helps correct historical inaccuracy in the past historical inaccuracy prevents americans from coming to terms with things that are important today such as racism homophobia class inequality and the glossing over of important events that could help us learn from them so as to prevent them from happening in the future after all george santayna once admonished those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it '' do yourself a favor and read this book and let it help you start dialogue with others about our important and rich history
leaving not a state or an oppression unturned lies across america is the enormous exhaustive sequel of kinds to lies my teacher told me taking a look at the monuments and markers across america that overwhelmingly paint a dishonest and unrelentingly positive view of america 's past what he provides here is n't just vital history it tells the vital sociological truth about history 's continued impact on regional landscapes many have complained that his section of the south is too long and too it 's now controversial to be but why it 's such an important section is in representing the continued oppression and inequality of the region as part of a process of sugarcoating our history and who was disenfranchised in the process plus his points demand to be considered never has a work so thoughtfully credibly and humorously elucidated the flaws and implications in the way we tell history read this book with an open mind and you 'll never look the same way at our use of the word discovered '' a loaded term that denies people living in certain areas for hundreds of years the undertones and occasionally overtones that glorify racism in countless southern monuments or the continued dialogue between how to represent historical items in a specific time and representing what actually happened this is a book whose importance in representing both the past and present can not be overstated
james loewen is an academic scholar who feels very strongly about the misinformation presented at places of historical significance this book presents a listing of five historic sites historic parks and historic markers that do n't quite get the story correct arranged in the book from west to east each state in the includes at least one listing and some states have several they all have one thing in common they either lie outright or they present misleading information about what took place even though this book is titled lies across america '' the truth is that most of the places presented in this book are not necessarily giving out false information to tourists rather they are failing to tell both sides of the story the themes most commonly mentioned in the passages of this book are those that the role of native americans in the settling of the north american continent fail to mention the bad treatment of african americans or that fail to tell the truth about the role of the confederate and union leaders in the civil war these historic places tend to explain things in a mostly positive way leaving out anything bad in order to make people feel better about a person or place or to avoid controversy loewen has some interesting facts to share about different historic sites around the country and some of the things you will read in this book will surprise you he feels that the negative controversial facts even if they do n't sound good should still be presented in their entirety historic sites should n't try to hide the they should let the facts be known to all this book presents some good history lessons about some of the forgotten moments in history loewen writes in a clear manner but i really wish he would refrain from using so many exclamation marks on most every page of this book he has an exclamation mark someplace maybe he is just so fascinated with his own work that he ca n't help himself but i really wish he would refrain from his tendency to shout history majors and other lovers of the past will enjoy this book most it does get a little carried away with topics about the civil war and coverage of oppressed groups of people but i still think it 's a good book with some important information for all to read what we hear is not always the full truth and loewen wants this to change
what happened in the past is the past and what we say about it is history james loewen says as he opens lies across america 21 in the course of 95 vignettes loewen demonstrates that much of the time history as it is presented to the public through historic sites across the country takes the form of hogwash loewen points out that historic site visitors should realize that each location tells two stories the story of the event or person it is commemorating and the story of its erection or preservation the former is the truth and the latter is what those who erected or preserved the monument want the general public to think is the truth loewen argues many erectors suffer from the heritage syndrome '' the impulse to only remember what is attractive or flattering and ignore all the rest 47 through an often humorous and sometimes sarcastic tone lies across america demonstrates that decidedly feel that nothing important happened until they arrived on the scene and after that what they did was all that mattered the title of one entry says it all do n't ' you see the eyes of the whites '' 74 time and time again loewen illustrates how many historic sites and place names slight native americans many tribes are known by negative names names their enemies gave to them and some monument monikers stigmatize indian religion and culture such as devil 's tower in wyoming whose name blasphemes local indians because to them it is a holy site 133 across the landscape native americans do not get the credit they deserve such as two historical markers in california that omit the indians ' contribution in building sutter 's fort and some of the catholic church 's missions loewen contends that some historical markers present invented history while others do n't present enough a monument in almo idaho memorializes a massacre that never took place visitors at the preserved homes of helen keller and president james buchanan see a wonderful array of period furniture and architecture but learn little of the famous people who lived there nothing is spoken of keller 's radicalism at her home and at the former buchanan residence visitors do not hear about the former president 's political views and homosexuality lies across america teaches americans to be highly critical of how history is portrayed across the landscape it teaches visitors to take what is presented in every historic site at face value and not assume the monument depicts the whole truth in the second appendix loewen includes questions every visitor should ask in order to get the real story of each monument or marker and any visitor would benefit from asking the questions and uncovering their answers the book 's one weakness is organization each entry is arranged geographically when it would be a smoother read if done topically organizing entries together by topic would avoid disjunction however the volume is highly readable and should be enjoyable to anyone interested in history both academic and laymen every entry grabs readers ' attention no matter if they have prior interest or knowledge in the subject presented its content generates a whole host of trivia questions and answers while also discussing the more important themes of american history racism sexism slavery and exploitation
good insight into the mind of a talented thinker unfortunately he dwindles of toward the end but definitely worth reading
tolstoy really hit on the fact that people work their whole lives in pursuit of something that will make them truly happy the more i get the happier i 'll be '' it does n't work like that even at his best he was miserable suicidal the answer is god plain and simple he is the only thing that tolstoy discovered would lead him to a more peaceful satisfying life this was a great book
the starting point of this work always fascinated me here is a great genius of mankind recognized throughout the world as an immortal creator of literature he is the father of a large family and has a wife he has loved and who has loved him he has great wealth other words here is a person who seems to have almost everything most human beings strive for in their lives and do not attain in any way close to the level at which he has attained them and yet it all turns meaningless to him and he in despair asks the question of whether there is anything to truly live for what can give life true meaning for he too senses that death will take him and all his worlds and their meaning away his answer comes from within his own personal christian faith it is not a formal church faith but rather has to do with the message of god he hears in his heart the message of love for all of mankind meaning is to be found according to tolstoy in living in a spiritual way in which stress is placed in goodness with others and sharing with them whatever one has to give the meaning of life is living according to this voice of god he hears within this is the answer tolstoy gave but the evidence of his life suggests it did not satisfy him for his questionings and doubts persisted throughout his lifetime and his life did not end in some great gesture of affirmation and love but rather in his running from the beloved wife who for years had embittered his life as he hers this work can not of course compare to tolstoy 's great novels in scope or even in human interest it is a look at a great man 's ' soul ' at one stage of his life but in giving that life omits many of the great skills tolstoy made use of in other writing as spiritual guide it has never seemed to me to provide the kind of answers to life meaning i have been looking for yet i understand how it may be of much help and consolation to all those who have suffered crises similar to that of tolstoy
tolstoy 's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing his writing is so personal and open that i do n't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved i was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active god in the conclusion of his search
tolstoy 's confession was written during his time of deep internal spiritual struggle upon his renunciation of a life of aristocratic wealth and worldly pleasure tolstoy longed for the sense of true peace that he saw in the peasant class thus he embarked upon a search for meaning and happiness through a life of simple faith manual labor and poverty he formulated his own chrisian philosophy based on christ 's sermon on the mount stressing the existence of the kingdom of god within the human heart civil disobedience and total pacifism this law of love '' is explored deeply in confessional form throughout this autobiographical work although this particular approach to living the life in christ ultimately did not cultivate in tolstoy the deep inner peace that he yearned for i feel that many of his ideas can be beneficial to people both within the church as well as not regardless of the validity of his doctrine it can not be denied that this is an authentic genuine and very human confession of a man searching for god and some meaning to life on earth although i personally disagree with many of tolstoy 's points i still hold his confession to be a universal work that deserves a fair exploration by all who have ever felt a similar need for inner peace and true reconciliation with god
tolstoy 's personal account of the existential crisis he faced after having published war peace and anna karenina if you 've ever laid awake late at night wondering what will come from what i am doing now and may do tomorrow what will come of my whole life '' then tolstoy 's confession is a book for you
i 'm a student who takes a philosophy class every semester despite the fact that it does absolutely nothing for my graduation requirements i always do well in the philosophy classes but there is one part i hate the reading i was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person the words and semantics in philosophy meant to clarify arguments when spoken simply seemed a muddle to me when read so it was with trepidation that i picked up my latest assignment tolstoy 's confession i read it and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed here finally was what i 'd been looking for the on the road of philosophy the jack kerouac of the field everyone who 's had worries about the fleeting nature of life and everyone who 's worried that it all means nothing this is your book
what a surprise from the title and cover art i was expecting a of july my country of thee stand at attention and salute book full of patriotic drivel but this is a very substantial and thoughtful study of america 's institutions and its critics and the author has a gift for straightforward easy to understand exposition dinesh d'souza came to the as an exchange student from bombay india in 1978. he has had an illustrious career in this his adoptive country he 's been active in politics as a presidential advisor and in other capacities but is mainly a scholar and writer he spent ten years with the american enterprise institution and at the time of writing this book was a fellow at the hoover institution the first chapter tackles all the criticisms of america from the left to europe to islam in a style that characterizes the entire book d'souza presents the arguments complaints against america its actions culture or whatever he then replies with a calm logical polite but emphatic refutation as well as being informative this book is a lesson in the proper way to conduct a debate not all the complaints against america are refutable america is not perfect and d'souza is the first to admit it he never engages in casuistry but admits the faults past and present with candor in a chapter titled two cheers for colonialism '' he describes the wrongs of western colonialism but also argues convincingly that by and large the benefits for those colonized have outweighed the wrongs he avers that the reason the west became the dominant civilization in the modern era is because it invented three institutions science democracy and capitalism the freedom in the west derives from this combination and allows the human being to become a different sort of person than those still living in traditional societies as d'souza concludes america is a new kind of society that produces a new kind of human being that human being confidant tolerant generous future oriented is a vast improvement over the wretched servile fatalistic and intolerant human being that traditional societies have always produced and that islamic societies produce now ''
alaister cooke became famous in britain via his regular broadcasts termed 'letter from america '' whereby he attempted to explain current events within america to a british audience he lived in america came to identify himself deeply with his adopted country and yet i do not think i ever heard him tackle what makes america great in quite the same manner as dinesh d'sousa who also is a first generation immigrant and one who became a citizen i am myself a first generation immigrant from africa and i was fascinated by the observations that d'sousa made having made some of them myself though without the deep analysis and connecting the dots that d'sousa did i wonder to those in america who hate this book what is it that you hate so much there are many who have moved here who have a deep respect for this country and its ideals we understand that mistakes are made but we come from countries where the political elites will not admit to those mistakes and worse will never attempt to correct them like the flag burning debate i sense that to many americans who are born here then the right to burn the flag and hate this country are issues that are 'protected ' under the constitution but to many who immigrate here we can and do love this country deeply acknowledge that errors have and will continue to be made but can also seperate the actions of some of its citizens instead of identifying them with the spirit that is america d'sousa 's book should be read it is not ' polemic instead it reasonably asks some questions provides some answers and established a framework for discussion and debate all of which is done in the best sense of a liberal tradition dont be close minded you dont have to agree but to reject these ideas first you have to be familiar with them
this is a smooth easy and short read d'souza ideas have a nice and consistant flow to them that makes this a pleasure to read with out making this a dissertation on some of the cultural warfare present in our day d'souza 's main thesis is to acknolwedge the debauchery caused by the unbridled use of freedom in our society from what he calls the ethic of authenticity also by acknowleding this he also points out where the islamists and do not this is the most important aspect of his book where by that same freedom when engaged in virtues such as altruism have a greater meaning in the greater context of the culture and in the world he talks about several key cultural issues in america and portrays them in an unapolgetic prose that acknowledges the short comings of america while also expressing them as great strengths for instance racism in america we were the country that led the charge to abolish it it took the lives of hundreds of thousands of americans in battle to do it as well and our republis survived this is not to america 's discredit becuase it has flaws but to its credit that it is unique in the sense that it overcame those flaws d'souza is quick to point out that the west has been responsbile for great progress in the world and that even in the tyranny of colonialism his native india benefitted from the imposition of the british where they outlawed the practice of killing female infants child marriage and more i found this book amazingly refreshing and i would assume that most multiculturalists who continue to blame america first for all the woe 's of the world will probably find it troubling d'souza i enjoyed reading every single page as an american a in the military a father and husband in a home i 'm am convinced that some ways are better to live this is not to the discredit of those who are chosing a different path but american altruism and invention are at the heart of almost everything that defines my life and for that i am unapologetic and greatful for that i 've seen first hand how the rest of the world revels in that same special 'stuff ' that is unique to america thanks for articulating this as you have it 's refreshing to not have to trudge through some angry american historian who 's ashamed to be an american my hat is off to you sir !
got the audio book and his arguments are cogent and well reasoned well worth the money invested
dinesh d'souza is the thomas paine of our day his insight logic grasp of the english language and wit make him i believe the best political author alive what 's so great about america is one of the greatest books i have read he digs down beyond the usual debate over the war on terror and aptly defines it as a war between two mutually exclusive philosiphies freedom coerced virtue he does n't deny the faults in our system but he shows that those problems are better than the alternative this book is well worth the money i spent on it and i am looking forward to reading other books by the author it is a shame that the devisive climate of our country would make some people deny the brilliance of this book because it does n't fit their point of view there have been uncalled for opinions that do n't reflect the book and even quotes from the book taken out of context someone claimed that he said that european violence agianst native americans was isolated instances '' when he actually said that there were isolated instances of europeans purposely spreading smallpox '' do n't believe the negativity and buy this book
without any prior knowledge of this book 's contents and my urgency to find a book for a particular class of mine i chose what 's so great about america solely based on the title and i must say i was not let down as i read the title the question filled many thoughts in my head and made my curiosity run wild the author dinesh d'souza an indian immigrant and now american citizen gives his unique and well researched view on america d'souza is clearly conservative but still gives very insightful thoughts analyzing both liberal and conservative arguments alike the general question he tries to answer is what many us citizens ask to themselves probably all the time why does everyone hate us he argues his point by incorporating three different worldly critiques from europe asia and the islamic world even though i am not very researched on any of the topics the author covers in the book the arguments were clear and easily understood while still being articulate and his honest and really quite frank views were really refreshing and also well respected this book helped revive in me an interest in my own country which was well faded being born and raised in the united states i think i took a lot of things that are unique and really quite special in this country for granted and this book brought about awareness to many topics that i had never thought about i have am and always will be very proud to be an american but after reading what 's so great about america '' i 'm much more excited to call myself american
this book explains the reason why so many people '' the and american culture '' but yet millions want to move to the either or the truth is the provides the best life in terms of wealth and freedom and they just ca n't get that back home the book is by a man who moved here and explains from the outside in why the is so great
in fact this a very good book for someone interested in this style of investing ie buying a handfull of rental houses for bettter or earlier retirement its easy to read and i found several important points not covered in some of the more famous books you prolly needs to read a few more books before beginning an investment enterprise but this shold be one of them
this is my book on real estate investing and i must say that each is totally different with different ideas and different strategies i think it 's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know i like how she talks about goal setting something i 've learned from tony robbins and that i feel is really important i like how she calculates the rate of return i like her differing point of views i would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book overall i learned a lot despite having already read 2 other good books a few things i did n't like i would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties and especially calculating if i can afford it or not the information she gives is quite good but since this is the most important topic i think it deserved even more the book is well worth the price and if you 're serious about investing i highly recommend it
this book has gotten me excited about getting into single family rentals while at the same time it 's not letting me get too hyped up in getting rich quick as rich as you want to be this book was a joy to read and a page turner at that i have read recent novels that were less exciting this book is full of priceless real world examples it also made me think of rental income and equity in a different light the only downside even though it spells every scenario out i had to go to the internet to find out what some of the real estate words meant all and all worth it
in her own conversational style suzanne thomas communicates a wealth of information for the small investor in a compact package while researching real estate investing and landlording i read about a dozen books that i carefully selected from the library out of the dozen i read and the others i perused this is one of two that i bought this book is an invaluable resource and i 've read through the majority of it at least four times this book begins by getting you thinking about your long term goals for investing for example is your focus on creating cash flow for income or are you interested in capitalizing on appreciation a nifty section of the book is on the subject why does n't everyone buy real estate '' this small section changed the way i thought about real estate investing after discussing obstacles to investing thomas clearly conveys that capitalizing on real estate takes patience you wo n't find thomas trying to fill your head with schemes or promises of unrealistic fast returns one of thomas ' statements is a clincher thomas says just remember that there is a difference between investing and speculating speculators need to get out before the market tanks and this can be difficult to time correctly investors have a long term plan that can handle ups and downs '' about the time i read thomas ' book i still had lingering thoughts about flipping '' properties i have to admit that flipping '' is enticing although people do make money flipping real estate this method is a gamble so unless you have a lot of cash to invest that you can afford to lose i would n't recommend it the chapter on selecting properties '' was especially helpful i do not consider myself a slum lord '' and want to own properties that my family would be pleased to live in we just completed work on home in a modest older neighborhood the home is now a nice place with some class and we 've enjoyed renting it to another family who fell in love with it in thomas ' book there are excellent chapters about loans with sharp insights into arms 1031 exchanges qualifying tenants etc each chapter has multiple tidbits of information what this book is not although this book contains good information about landlording it is not a nuts and bolts landlording book nor does it profess to be you should seek the nuts and bolts from landlording books from other investors from a real estate attorney and also from an experienced community education programs usually have someone in the area who is an expert and teaches investment and landlording classes this book is excellent and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a book on this subject i hope thomas writes more books on landlording and related subjects

i first read this book three years ago and it still stands as one of the best books i have ever read on real estate investing if you have read any amount of rei books you know that this area of publishing it is flooded with 'motivational ' books that are full of fluff and short on details rich dad series comes to mind suzanne thomas 's book delivers the real info that you are looking for she offers pro insights on cashflow down payment selecting a property different loans to consider marketing finding the best tenants details etc the focus is on single family rentals but the info can be applied to most real estate investing situations if you are a beginner investor this is the book you want to start with
this book is ideal for the novice investor or beginner investor looking to get into rental houses i read the first edition of this book and was very impressed i then read the second edition and was pleasantly surprised at the amount new info the author updated a lot and added a lot of additional info so if you have read the first edition already it 's certainly still worth reading the second the author provides literally everything you need to know from how you will qualify a rental property for mortgages insurance ads how to screen tenants literally everything i wish i had read this book first before i had read my other real estate books as this book answers literally all of my questions i had trouble getting answers for well worth the purchase !
i 've read this book 3 times it is written very clearly with specifics about the author 's experiences in purchasing and managing rental homes very little fluff '' geared more towards beginning investors but intermediate investors will also pick up some good tips if you 're starting out in this business get this book
since this is one of many previous reviews i will be brief this is one of the most extraordinary novels i have ever read but not the easiest one the first time i read it i felt overwhelmed and undereducated until i saw a another book written as a companion to the novel it helped a lot with the unfamiliar cultural references of which there are many and i felt better i read it a second time on a couple of flights back and forth across the pacific perfect place you 're captive with few distractions and it took a few more hours than that to finish in the end if you can read no other novel or if you are going to be isolated on an island with no chance of escape and can take a book to read take this one you wo n't regret it
perhaps extreme paranoia is one way out of or at least our only healing response to our existential loneliness the other way of course is love but this takes a second place in pynchon 's world view they have done this to me i am their victim '' is perhaps a more comforting than i am completely irrelevant '' at least one can have some kind of fun or meaning to life in finding out who they are and why they have done it
since there are already 250 reviews of this book i am just going to say that the earlier portion of the book may contain the very best prose style ever written even better than joyce and nabokov ! oh and also pynchon was not only robbed of a pulitzer prize but also so far of a highly deserved nobel prize also true of john ashbery
i was expecting a real blockbuster ending to this series and i was a bit disappointed i thought the killers would turn out to be people way more involved in the series and i was disappointed that they were really fringe characters i felt let down by that still you ca n't go wrong with a mariah stewart book she 's one of the best out there when it comes to keeping you rivited
working a case in central america fbi agent connor shields stumbles across a horrifying of young children being herded into a cargo truck obviously doomed to a future of slavery or as unwilling participants in the international child sex trade conflicted because he 's on a very important mission connor is about to intervene when he 's accosted by a colleague who assures him that everything is under control that both local and us authorities are on the case heartened by this news connor departs for his scheduled rendezvous what he does n't realize however is that his trusted associate is in league with the kidnappers and that because of his poor timing he and all those he holds dear have been placed in mortal danger the fourth and final book in stewart 's dead '' series following dead wrong dead certain and dead even dead end cannily combines two disparate premises the investigation into the deaths of several schoolgirls at the hands of a serial killer and the travesty that is the child sex trade resulting in a tale guaranteed to hold readers ' spellbound until they reach the last page although her writing is not as polished as one might expect from such a seasoned author stewart nevertheless manages to wring all the tension she can out of her compelling subject matter offering her audience a book that provides suspense and social commentary in equal doses a story dealing that effectively illustrates the toll crime takes on victims criminals and law enforcement officials
good but not great stewart tries a little too hard in this book it 's still good and i would recommend reading it but it 's not worth reading at the hardcover price
if you have n't read the first three books in mariah stewarts dead '' series dead wrong dead certain and dead even go pick up a copy today although not necessary to enjoy dead end you 'll get a much better feel for some of the main characters plus just three really good reads if you read the other books first that said dead end centers around anne marie mccall an fbi profiler and her new love police detective evan crosby at a mutual friend 's wedding evan is surprised over the jealousy he feels by how close annie still is with the shields family her fiance undercover agent dylan shields was murdered two years ago during a covert op the shields family with its many children all in fbi positions is a one who still has a place for the memory of what annie and dylan were to each other evan attempting to get over his jealousy but knowing that annie will never be at peace until she knows what really happened to dylan suggests that they take one last look at the file on his death hoping that maybe this one last shot might provide annie with the closure she needs and that a new set of eyes might come up with new leads in the investigation what they uncover are more questions missing files and situations that prove more and more dangerous who was really the intended victim that night does the locale of dylan 's death have something to do with the current case evan is working on why are members of the extended shields family ending up in questionioning situations stewart has written another winner i 'm sad to see the dead '' series end but i was happy to see that with the release of dead end all the questions from the last three books were answered a real winner you wo n't want to miss this book it 's an excellent offering in the romantic supsense genre !

i 'll keep my review pretty short pretty much all the good points the other reviewers wrote are pretty much true so i 'll just add my two cents 1 this is mainly futures trading even though some plays sometimes apply to still even if you 're not into futures the section on psychology methodology trading plan etc are worth the book 2 the examples in this book will really help you understand how a real trader should trade emotionlessly the whole idea that you need to have chosen a stop exit target exit entry point whether you should scale is very well described here if you 're looking for forex trading i recommend beat the odds '' by igor toshchakov his english is n't perfect but the book is filled with useful info
this book is amazing ! it is a very engaging read and never gets stale the knowledge you get out of it is priceless the tactics i learned in this book were very successful when applied to swing trading for me highly recommend
well amazon invited me to write a review about this book i must give it 5 stars because i gave other books on trading which were not that good 5 stars as well i bought this book based on the reviews already written here and yes i was quite delighted i liked the chapters on psychology very much i 'd like to cut these chapters and paste them into vadim graifer 's book techniques of tape reading '' and delete his chapters about his losing experiences as a beginner that would be the perfect trading book for me the setups they 're okay but i 'm using none of them since i got my own pair of setups but they 're a great starting point for someone who 's traded with no setups at all there is one reviewer who 's concerned that carter might be blabbing away too many secrets do n't you worry about that like william gann said a chemist 's biggest secret wo n't make the carpenter any wiser you should n't take over carter 's writing i did n't like what he said about moving averages and stop levels if you use a technical stop be sure that you really want to lose that much money as a scalper for years now and quite successful his suggestions were beyond my comfort level you got ta find out for yourself how to fine tune your system i 've found out for myself that i am not the kind of a trader who goes for the big moves use carter 's suggestions to create your own trading system this book will definitely help you actually there were some ideas that i could use to improve my trading all in all mr carter is very ! generous in sharing information and knowledge with the there 's sure something for everyone which can be used to make money right away but only experience will make you a better trader
this is an easy to read book with very specific trade setups and easy to follow instructions so far after 2 weeks using the morning gap play it is consistently profitable if you 've traded you know two weeks does n't prove anything but it 's nice to see something work right off the bat a couple of his plays in the book i 'm not comfortable with but i have n't tried them and a couple of them require buying his tradestation codes to be fair he does tell you how they work so if you want to code them yourself you could no wishy washy theory here just simple to follow set ups with profit targets with stop loss and real good advice on risk and amount of account needed per contract and how to wright a trading business plan and some info on computers overall a good book
well i wrote about 10 reviews on trading books so far so that should clear off some doubts of the previous reviewer this book just covers almost every parts of trading from psychology money management risk trade plans daily routines computer hardware software useful websites and even a part on health requirements big portion of the book is on setups that the author recommended those setups seem more on indexes and futures trading plus you must have required software and services tradestation esignal to run so it may not be suitable for all interesting enough the author quoted many books i have read and reviewed before he just absorbs and takes things in action better than me he can explain mark douglas 's concepts in in the zone ' better than what i can find in the book itself that would be credited to his good writing style and openness i just got the feeling that he really wanted to help inexperienced traders out in this book never mind that there is some selling about his products along the way ok with me
i bought this book due to the excellent reviews and i agree with all the 5 stars that everyone has given it it is so good that i worry too many people reading it since it is going to be very difficult to take their money if they apply what they read so please do n't read it i wo n't make money so easely
there are at least trading books out there i know because i have probably read half of them i also believe i have learned something from every one of them most of the books are like doctors they specialize in one area or another this book mastering the trade '' is different its the general practioner '' that really knows what he is doing john carter really covers enough ground to help a trader get profitable he covers all areas of trading hardware software psychology basic mechanics of markets and most importantly a traders business plan just those items alone more than cover the cost of this book but then he also adds about a dozen market mr carter does not just show one or two of each like most books he shows dozens of each example some more profitable than others but enough to give you a good feeling of what he is trying to explain while i do believe this book alone will not make you a great trader i know it will help you in your journey this is not an absolute beginner book you need some market knowledge to get through this comfortably with that said i think this is one of the best books out there on trading i am giving it to my son who has recently become interested in trading after he learned about compound interest watch out world because he is only 14 and is going to start much better prepared then the rest of us ! one last note about this book you will not read it and become a better trader learning to trade is like learning to drive a car you ca n't read a book and then go out and drive successfully you have to practice you have to see whats working and do more of it and you have to see whats not working and do less of that and most importantly you have to do it enough so you get to the point where you feel comfortable with anything the road or market throws at you good luck
a hands on authentic book very practical easy to follow excellent focus on the psychology of trading and the management of trading
this is an excellent text which will allow you to become a decent beginning trader carter discusses psychology computers trading platforms quote software market sentiment indicators and gives you 8 trading setups a brilliant book
outstanding book ! mark provides very practical examples of promoting your product or service it is easy to read and there is plenty of white spaces on each page this makes it easy for any type of notation and ease of use of the highlighter i read the book in one sitting while awaiting my delayed flight and i was excited after reading the book and i was not upset with the delayed flight the only section i disliked in the book was the section on magic but i understand his viewpoint of why he wrote about magic buy a copy and see how you can profit rather quickly and learn about magic
i bought this book because i have read article written by mark before he is an excellent writer and very clearly presents difficult information he goes above and beyond on this book it was hard to put down even when it was 1 am i have read it once and put it aside for a few days to digest all that he gives you i have it on my calendar to pick up and reread again next week it may take a time or two through the book to truly get it and by get it i mean absorb it believe it and implement it he provides concrete examples concise practical laws of marketing and business building an excellent read and worth multiples to your business if you implement even of the information he provides
i consider myself a marketing expert i 've built two hugely successful mail order companies within just a few years and thought i knew ever trick in the book from gary halbert to dan kennedy and i found a new gem in this book ! there was n't anything new '' per se but the way the author had updated '' the importance of marketing techniques was a refreshing polish on things that have gotten dusty over the past few decades his point of view has been welcomed and in direct response he actually includes testing examples that he 's done for instance he tested using the 7 '' which is ted nicholas ' marketing trick from eons ago he gives you information on when he tested the 99 versus 95 and 97 he give you exact figures on which pulled the most many other authors who talk about the '' will tell you that they pull more but never give actual figures on which pulls the most probably because they 've never done a test themselves this book focuses on the offer '' and the benefits '' to the customer as broad as that may seem this author seems to get deep into the on exactly how to push people 's buttons to get people to buy and within 3 seconds and he does it in a fun lightning fast manner that makes reading the book a snap all of the traditional marketing secrets '' are brought up to the century standards there is so much information that bombards people everyday that you have to hit people quickly and hit 'em hard other marketing books by the greats are outdated because of that huge main fact life is n't the same as it was before the internet therefore we have less time to get people 's attention this book is highly recommended for those of you who have studied dan kennedy ted nicholas gary halbert jeff paul or any of the other marketing greats this is an update for the century and is very necessary if you are going to sell things to people who are becoming desensitized to advertising and if you think you 're a marketing expert you need this book even more ! is n't it the truth that those of us who think we know so much about marketing that we tend to lock out '' new discoveries or forget about the oldies '' but goodies and then we become dinosaurs perhaps as dan kennedy and others have become and that 's why as a marketing expert you need this book more than anyone else because you need a block of wood to knock you upside your head ! as a marketer you can never think you are an expert because the world is changing too much ! highly highly recommended i will even go so far as to say that this is one of the top 5 marketing books out there ! and that 's saying a lot from someone who has most every marketing book there is
i found this book really enlightening both from a business and a personal perspective mark 's writing style is relaxed and friendly which made the book an easy read it is also very clear no room for ambiguity i especially liked his comment on think and grow rich it has certainly made me think about reading a book versus acting on the information shared in the book
at around 200 pages the irresistible offer is not exactly a hefty tome actually author mark joyner had to use a few formatting tricks to get the book up to even that modest page count one can not guage the value of a book by its size though in this easy to read text joyner presents information beyond value to any business person whether your business is online or offline you can apply the lessons of the irresistible offer to your marketing and promotional efforts the book 's subtitle how to sell your product or service in 3 seconds or less only tells part of the story yes joyner does focus a great deal of time on those things which have impact on a potential buyer or customer immediately because we are all barraged with information and sales messages on a continuous basis it 's so important as marketers for us to be able to break through the clutter and get our messages heard this book definitely defines how that can be accomplished it 's more than that though the irresistible offer also talks about how our marketing messages can be shared and spread delving in to the essense of viral marketing '' this is something you have probably heard about joyner does a great job of explaining viral marketing in an easy to understand way at all points of the book clear examples are used to help make important points and show the principles being discussed they help to make this book one you will read not just once but probably many times

after i read marlon brando 's own memoirs my view on him changed that he was one of the most brilliant actors in history is a fact most people are aware of but what fewer know is that he was a very intelligent man who helped discriminated folk groups more than many i knew this even before i read this book songs my mother taught me but what i was not aware of was how sensitive and funny he could be when he felt comfortable i believe much of his tough '' behavior simply was an image not all the time of course he was very masculine and could which he admits in this book be brutal at times but this side of him is obviously exaggerated by the press through the years after a long introduction by robert lindsey who put this book together with brando the actor opens chapter i with the sentence as i stumble back across the years of my life trying to recall what it was about i find that nothing is really clear '' i respectfully disagree with this brando tells his story with so many interesting funny and sad details and comments that i ca n't do anything else the sentence that follows however is more telling i suppose the first memory i have was when i was too young to remember how young i was i opened my eyes looked around in the light and realized that ermi was still asleep so i dressed myself as best as i good and went down the stairs left one foot first on each step '' ermi was the childhood love of marlon or 'bud ' as he was referred to at that time she was his nurse maid and he writes lovingly about how she took care of him during his earliest years but only a few months after his first school year began she married a man marlon never got a chance to even see and left him although marlon tells the story with understanding there is a clear bitterness between the lines at the time ermi said marlon discovered a fact his parents were abused to alcohol this did of course not make the situation more pleasant marlon 's picture of his mother dorothy is filled with love while his father marlon is described as a brutal '' he had his reasons during his teens he and his sisters two and four years older than him had to bring their mother home from the police station often once a week after a night out '' in these circumstances it happened now and then that their father took his wife upstairs and beat her one time when this was the case marlon ran up to the put his teeth in a and said terrifying if you ever touch her again i will kill you '' in spite of such unhappy memories brando 's years are also often described with much humor escpecially one episode impressed me while he was in a military school which he hated but his father had sent him there one thing annoyed him more than anything else a bell that rang every quarter one night he stole the bell and buried it the next day the school had never been as quiet before they finally had to use a tromphet to make the ring signals and every time the instrument made a sound marlon fell on the ground with laughter when he was twenty he went to new york to make a living as an actor though only to survive '' he began his career on actor 's studios where later many other great actors james dean among them would start their careers his wonderful teacher stella adler '' saw what she had between her hands and after some small parts in a couple of broadway plays he got his chance as stanley kowalski in tennessee william 's masterpiece a streetcar named desire in 1947. brando was praised from the beginning on but brando himself has several times also in this book claimed that he do n't care about stanley kowalski a brutal do you see the resemblances he is n't impressed of anything i detest the character '' is brando 's words which puzzled a whole world myself included marlon brando 's portrait of stanley kowalski is together with his portrait of terry malloy in on the waterfront and don corleone in the godfather the best acting he ever did streetcar was filmed in 1951 and was a huge hit it made brando world famous but he admits in his autobiography that he truly would have been happier if he had not been a movie star brando describes each film he appeared in with interesting and funny notes how he became the characters he went into etc a deilightful surprise was that he actually a lot on several of his movies including sayonara the young lions the godfather last tango in paris the missouri breaks and apocalypse now the characters in these movies were his creations in every way although he has left out information about his three marriages and comes out with only a little actually very little stuff about his children brando 's private life is tension and funny reading through the whole book he tells shamelessly about a handful of his affairs with all kinds of women about his love for animals about his temperament like when he knocked out the front windows of a bus with both fists and when he gradually learned to control this anger the life on teitora the island where he had the happiest moments of his life are described with deep love and yet honesty for the tahitian people there is something for everyone here but personally i found the chapters where he confirms his political opions most interesting i agreed with almost everything it helped me a lot to understand human behavior and it was a very good source to a school test i was forced to do while i still was reading the book no doubt marlon brando was one of the greatest actors in history we know that but besides he was also one of the greatest storytellers in history buy rent or steal this book personally i bought it here on read it and then you know everything you need to know about the genius marlon brando you do n't need to be a fan of him already to enjoy this book but it is doubtful that you can read it through without becoming it forget the ridicilous this is the one you need
i have n't read this book as it was a present to my mother i heard good reviews about it on the wbai radio here in new york
marlon my is the world 's greatest actor this autobiography is one of the best i have ever not the absolute best i own several biographies and often i get bored put the book down and never touch it again not with this book ! marlon brando was made into a person with this book he was sensitive and at least that 's how the book made me perceive him i 've read this book three times since it came out a decade ago and am sure i will read it again in the future i 've loaned my copy out to friends that were n't particular fond of marlon brando but after each person read this book they fell in love with it now they are avid fans of his movies i urge anyone interested in old hollywood or films in general to read this you do not have to be a marlon brando fan but beware you just might be when you finish the book
this book provides great insight into marlon brando the man and his view of the world and himself in it marked by poignant eloquent intelligent and fascinating interludes on philosophy history and perhaps most surprisingly the craft of acting itself readers will enjoy getting to know the brando behind the tabloid images and salacious gossip mongers brando also almost succeeds in his project of deconstructing his own myth perhaps betraying just how deeply his father 's early and constant beratements of his abilities and potential affected him you 'll never amount to anything '' brando can not seem to believe that he did anything out of the ordinary he is beyond disparaging about his own acting and dismissive of his titanic achievements in cinema art and cultural redefinition generally considered the finest actor of all time brando in two separate decades twice revolutionized acting and redefined the medium he was a liberal and a humanitarian eminently more interested in making a contribution to humankind in some other in his words more important '' endeavor than acting he several times states that not all is black and white it is a polka dot '' world and he is understanding of the shortcomings of others yet he is a harsh judge of himself and seems to view his own life in terms he succeeded in important ways in helping mankind or he frittered away his talents on the meaningless if lucrative game of acting still his achievement as well as the pervasiveness of his cultural influence think blue jeans and despite his own discounting of it here was remarkable sensitive thoroughly enjoyable very funny and exceedingly humble this memoir is not complete but it gives us a window into the mind of one of the most remarkable and influential personalities of the last century
brando was also a terrific storyteller this book puts to rest so many rumors and gives an honest of this large and largely misunderstood genius his life was filled with deepest tragedy but brando managed to stay positive and he kept his killer sense of humor the book is funny ! brando was an actor but also a humanitarian and a true friend to those without a voice i encourage fans to hear his story from his own voice rather than one of the many bios available
the paradox that is marlon brando has always been the allure for me besides the obvious brillance as an actor i 'm far from alone in my opinion i think it was appropriate that he did n't write about his marriages and children such things as we know are private matters too painful and complex confessionals and autobiographies are not interesting anyway and rarely do they reveal the true character of their subjects i learned a lot about who brando was just by reading his description of autumn leaves in libertyville and the night sky over tetiaroa brando was a human being with passions demons and needs just like the rest of us he loved chimps traveling music fart jokes and good books he was more instinctual than analytical this is evident by the terse analysis he gives of his film characters brando did not piss away his talent '' as dick cavett had said on an npr phone interview last year as this book reveals brando never had the acting bug that 's why he only worked when he wanted or needed to work and that 's why he did n't have the work ethics or ambition that our culture expects from a talented film star if brando had contempt it was for hollywood and it 's pretentions not for his craft in the book you 'll find admiring and humble tributes to his mentors and fellow actors including stella adler elia kazan karl malden james dean robert duvall and kenneth branagh i 'm glad brando lived long enough to get old and fat and that he did n't die tragically young like marilyn jfk or jimi hendrix i 'm thankful for the films and words he did leave behind this book reveals what a natural born trickster he was his generous and tempestuous nature how he was seeker of truth and a voluptuary brando was all this and more i truely miss him
before reading songs my mother taught me i recommend printing out a copy of brando 's filmography from and then watch as many of his films that you can find this will help you enjoy the book because brando assumes the reader has watched the films he talks about i watched most of his movies and became a fan as many other reviewers stated this book is an easy read i felt as if he was in the room with me telling his story brando 's life is a fascinating journey his philosophy on various topics can leave the reader with mixed emotions i left the book a lot more curious than i did going into it i wonder if his facts about huac isreal and the native american are true my future project is to seek out the information and decide for myself unlike many of today 's celebrites he does n't come across as arrogant or pretentious he had that reputation but the book suggests otherwise brando is humble about his talent his role in various causes he joined and his place in hollywood as one of the greatest actors any aspiring actor should read this book brando advocates the 'method ' which includes bringing your life experiences and incorporating them into the role you are playing in the same breath he tells the reader not to overresearch the role as he did at times later on in his career he admits to 'winging it ' because summoning up strong emotions are taxing when you get older i respect his choice to leave his family and marriages out of his book it really is n't necessary i get the sense that his experiences with women have n't embittered him by the time he wrote the book but he does admit to spending a large portion of his life as an angry man brando considering acting a means to an end that 's all in his words the hours are good the pay great and you only have to work three months out of the year i respect the fact that he did n't get sucked into the whole 'hollywood ' scene he explains why he refused the best actor award for the godfather his reasons make perfect sense even if you do n't agree with them i highly recommend this book if you can find it new buy it it 's worth the money brando 's viewpoint is n't definitive but you can get a better understanding of a man who in many ways is still a mystery he 's someone i would 've like to have met i envy people like edward norton and johnny depp two actors around my age who had a chance to work with him
ok so this book is a bit old now and i found it late the advice is timeless and very useful unlike so many decorating books that are just filled with pictures of beautiful rooms in beautiful homes this book gives you some basic principles so you can make your own stuff beautiful in your own home some of the decorating that i had already done in my home i really like and this book tells me the principle behind what i did why i like it some of the decorating i have done in my own home i do n't like and this book tells me what i can do to fix it so the mysteries of balance alignment furniture arrangement displaying stuff grouping pictures etc are solved my only problem with the book is the section on wall color that was very brief and not very satisfactory and she basically suggests that white walls are a good safe choice there is no section on decorating color schemes either and that would be helpful this is why i gave the book only 4 stars rather than 5
for those who say this book is boring and has too many rules i would ask if all the books out there full of glossy photos and little explanation were all that helpful why did you need to buy this book in the first place decorating is like any other creative profession the foundation of the magic '' that a good decorator can provide actually consists of basic principles that can be learned by anyone oh and i think the reason some of the photos appear dated is that we are used to seeing design books incorporating the latest trends she used photos of real homes which i 'm sure contained furniture that the owners had been collecting for years that 's kind of the point of this book i love the books full of glossy color photos of dream rooms and i 'll continue to look at those for inspiration and ideas but this book has made my home look better now
no other book has ever shown us novice decorators how to light a room arrange our art and furniture as well as this one it is easy to follow and sticks to its promise that we do not have to buy all new furniture to make our home look really pretty anyone who would like to give their home an extreme makeover without throwing away what they already have will be truly amazed at what they can accomplish after reading use what you have decorating
the good the author 's room plans actually take into account furniture placement around windows and glass doors as well as entry points her examples show real homes with odd mismatched furniture clear before and after pictures and floor plans even if they are in black and white she has some good rules of thumb to at least think of which you may or may not agree with and tends toward the neutral as far as paint you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art she tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room the bad most of it is about living rooms and she apparently assumes that you are doing a good deal of formal entertaining there there are virtually no ideas for people who use their living rooms for anything else home office exercise room playroom etc not everyone entertains in their house some have backyard bbqs and others entertain at restaurants or the local park where i disagreed with her if you have a library of books that you actually use you would never organize them by size you would organize them by except of course for your truly oversized books pillows on sofas hmmm i think you can use them on futons or sofas with hard armrests but on your typical overstuffed sofa they 're overkill would rather see a nice handmade afghan to the critics who were upset that she ignored '' the tv it is an etiquette thing actually the tv is not supposed to be more important than your guests and she is by no means the only decorator who says to hide the tv in an armoire or better yet put it in another room these days a lot of the newer homes have dedicated home theater '' type rooms anyway with a alternative being a spare bedroom besides if you 're having a superbowl party or some such event it would be smarter to have a tv in the room area where hopefully there is no carpet and nothing that could be ruined by food bottom line this book has a lot of useful ideas for furniture arranging geared primarily to the living room and family room but you can also use them as a point for rearranging other rooms some good ideas for some of the other rooms like dining rooms you do n't use because your kitchen is plenty big enough to eat in i thought this book was much much better than decorating for good by carol talbott
once in a while a book has a great impact on your life and use what you have decorating is one of those books for me my house looks like i brought in an expensive decorator but i did it myself just from what i learned by reading it the title promises you can transform your home quickly and the results confirm that principles are shown in photos of real homes and the author makes it easy to understand what was wrong with the rooms and how the mistakes were corrected without buying furniture what is most impressive is that the rooms in the book look totally different in one or two hours it took me more than three hours to finish my living room and dining room with a little help from my better half and now both rooms look amazing if you want to give your house a fast makeover look no further
if i could have given this book ten stars i would have christopher lowell and his seven layers of design should have taken a page from laurie ward 's excellent book which was practical easy to read and sensible the before and after '' pictures of a variety of rooms helped greatly she was right in less than hour using her principles i transformed my crowded living room into a beautiful and stunning arrangement that encourages conversation and looks much larger at the same time this book really helps in that the design principles are adaptable and applicable to any size room or home and really gives you concrete ideas to use in creating comfortable and beautifully arranged living spaces brava laurie and thanks
i have n't read all the reviews already written for this book so my apologies if i point out things that have already been said my favorite thing about this book is that it 's and simple ward does n't waste our time with unnecessary descriptions and adjectives the velvety fabric drapes sumptuously over the chair adding a dramatic look '' instead she lists and explains the 10 design principles that most designers use but do n't tell us in books and magazines in ward focuses on topics such as placing furniture in a way that achieves balance and cohesiveness among other tips she explains the rules for creating a focal point minimizing a rollercoaster '' effect arranging wall art and displaying decorative objects and collections although she mainly uses living room areas to explain her design principles they can be applied to every room but she also includes a few pages of tips for each room in the house photos of rooms are presented in black white i really think this was a great idea because you can see the layout problems and solutions more clearly i think that color photos would have taken away from that for both before and after rooms a photo and floor plan of each are presented to show the differences i also liked the little sidebar quizzes in which you look at the before photo and try to pick out the design problems the furniture in the room examples may not be that appealing but they do look like furniture used in most typical homes i like that because it makes the book seem so unpretentious ward does n't give off that snobby designer impression instead she seems and in touch with those who do n't live in mansions and spend on a bed i have to comment on one last thing there 's a small section for women on handling the '' men in their lives from her experience over the years she has found that men tend to resist change and that as long as it 's functional they do n't usually care what it looks like so ward has a little section titled here 's what you can do '' and then offers up a scheme to get your man to cooperate i just think that was so funny and cute ! probably because i can relate my husband has shirts in his closet from the 90 's and refuses to part with them then complains that he does n't have enough closet space anyway i do n't give many books 5 stars but it is i refer to it often and have about 18 sticky notes in it along with the underlined and highlighted passages i continue to buy the beautiful designer books and magazines for ideas and inspiration but now proudly when i look at a photo i can see the design principles at work and how the look '' was achieved
the writer 's book of hope released in 2003 continues to be a beacon of hope to those on the long and tumultuous path to publication keyes gives anecdote after anecdote on writer 's rejected who went on to become excerpt '' ursula le guin sent out her first story when she was eleven she got her first acceptance at james dickey endured years of form rejections before he finally saw on one that said not bad '' according to james lee burke 's agent 100 editors turned down lost boogie including multipe editors at the same house before louisiana state university press bought burke 's first novel for a pittance it 's a rare writer who does n't have to hack through a jumble of rejection slips before and after getting published some of history 's books were rejected many times before finally being accepted the ginger man by donleavy now considered one of the best 100 novels ever published was turned down by publishers before it found a home '' besides happy endings to rejected beginnings keyes takes us inside the world of publishing some of the chapter titles before drinking hemlock with discouragers of rejection publishing tribe why publishing resembles high school and more this book is one of the few writing books i ca n't bring myself to give up every so often i find myself discouraged beyond reason and this book takes me back from the ledge of despair it 's a must read for any writer needing an injection of optimism reviewed on author interviews book reviews and fiction related discussion
keyes does a great job presenting the case for finding hope in the writing process this book specifically discusses dealing with anxiety frustration and despair overcoming the discouragers in your life exorcising excuses for not writing and pursuing a career in writing the rites of rejection the nature of publishers and editors and how to keep hope alive years ago i had a basketball coach who taught if you 're not getting at least four fouls in a game you 're not playing defense '' he did n't like fouls but his point was in the process of playing the game aggressively fouls are going to happen fouls are not necessarily indicators of defeat they are indicators of effort likewise keyes ' approach to rejection is that all successful writers deal with rejection in his book he provides numerous examples including nobel and pulitzer prize winners of authors who face rejection even after winning critical acclaim rejection is a fact of life keyes say learn to deal with it easily stated but it still hurts according to keyes writers who have not experienced rejection are not sending out enough material and writers who do n't learn to accept rejection as part of the writing process are doomed to quit writing altogether keyes is the author of another book titled the courage to write '' which i highly recommend similar books by other authors which i would also recommend for the aspiring writer include on becoming a novelist '' by john gardner and the forest for the trees '' by betsy lerner ron atkins is the author of two children 's books abby and the bicycle caper and his upcoming january 2005 abby and the bike race mystery
every writer needs hope and hope is what i always get when i read and reread ralph keyes 's book the writer 's book of hope as an experienced many times published writer people might think i 've got this writing profession figured out but i do n't and on those days when i 'm feeling lonely dejected and sometimes rejected i know i can turn to keyes 's book to help me realize i 'm not alone in my insecurity and feeling of flakiness there are days when i wonder if it is n't too late to go to plumbing school or enroll in the matchbook school of mosaic tiling writing does that too you plays games with your mind and confidence but when those days creep up on me i find solace in hope it makes my green skin turn less bright when i read john grisham received odd rejections and agents turned down jk rowlings yet they persisted and that among other things is the difference between writers who stay the distance and those who let the publishing world get the better of them keyes has been there he 's one of us he 's not on a perch talking down to us wannabes he 's simply further in his journey than many of us and that qualifies him as a leader and the fact that he 's willing to share the good bad and ugly of this writer 's world is generous reading the book is like sitting in an easy chair talking to a wise sage with a little bit of mischief in his eyes talking about the world of writing eyeball to eyeball writer to writer friend to friend and by doing so keyes offers us that thread that tethers writers together in this profession that is not for the faint of heart and for that i 'm grateful susan debow writer
ralph keyes ' books about writing have helped pull my ambition out of a twice his first the courage to write helped me finish my first novel which eventually got published the to that the writer 's book of hope helped me get started on my fourth book at a point when i was beginning to feel frustrated with both the business of writing and the relentlessly demanding craft of it what keyes does in this book and in the first is to map out the tricky and sometimes dangerous emotional landscape of writing and he does it by giving us examples and anecdotes from famous and sometimes legendary writers who 've had similar frustrations better than practically any book on writing out there the writer 's book of hope offers those of us who spend our days in front of typewriters and computers making up worlds with words the boost we need to carry on and keyes does this not with some inspirational messages but with honest realistic and historical examinations of the traditional difficulties that all writers regardless of their fame or lack or it face and how they have coped and kept writing highly recommended
this book really opened my eyes to the reality of the publishing world it also helped disapate a lot of anger and self pity i was feeling who knew you had to work this hard well now i do so it goes i can now forge ahead without feeling so sorry for myself
this book had great practical advice for each stage in your child 's reading life particularly helpful were the suggestions on overcoming difficult stages when children might tend to become apathetic towards reading i also appreciated the emphasis on the total experience of reading rather than the simple ability to identify words on a page in addition i found it reassuring to hear that my husband 's and my own enjoyment of reading will go a long way towards influencing our kid 's desire to read
i really enjoyed this book by nora roberts it is set in the carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer imho it has romance treasure hunting and a little magic great ! i liked it alot
this has got to be my all time favorite book i could not put it down read it several years ago the scenery mystery romance all intertwined makes for a great novel
this is one of my favorite books by nora roberts setting is her specialty she really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure you really come to care about these characters and it 's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go diving for the very first time in your life ! this one earned its 5 stars !
i took this book to hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice i loved the relationship between the two main characters i felt like the ending may have been a little rushed maybe because i did not want it to end ! also i felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story matthew lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book other than that i loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars
with the chilly season setting in here in washington state the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long i must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree the water the sand and the longing of wanting to be there this is the first of nora roberts i have read however i am an avid jd robb reader this book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun how exciting ! the plot was wonderful the characters were likable the villians were nasty this is one book that i am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat and i will read it again when the cold starts setting in so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure
i am fairly new to nora roberts but this book is not only my favorite by her it 's one my favorite books altogether it was so well written it made me feel like i were diving and hunting treasures myself ! and it has such a sweet romantic storyline i was really sorry to see it end i hope there will be a sequel i recommend any woman to read this book whether you like romance novels or not
first let me say that while i have read many of nora roberts books more often than not i am somewhat disappointed while she is always a reliable read her stories tend to be very formulaic and too often forgettable i picked up the reef almost by accident at a friend 's for lack of anything else to read having read a few of nora 's books before my expectations were n't that high i was pleasantly surprised unlike the predictability of her other books this one went against convention in many ways while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery generally nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship but she balances the two beauifully here not only did she create an intriguing villain but the love story was touching as other readers have said i liked how she spread it out over the years which made it slightly more realistic and somehow much sweeter at the end the development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical nora in short if you 're not typically a nora roberts fan give this one a try ! not the best romantic suspsense i 've ever encountered but definetly worth the read
i ca n't say enough good things about the reef ! it shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men and a strong sensitive male that is n't afraid to dream this is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist tate beaumont and matthew lassiter and their families the families run into each other while for angelique 's curse a treasure that has eluded everyone and many think it is only a myth but this artifact is worth everything to some even worth killing another as this joint expedition continues it holds all of the elements needed for a great story mystery romance secrets that ca n't be shared deceptions and threats there are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader is n't sure which avenue nora roberts will take until she delivers them to it this always keeps you on the edge of your seat and gives you a first hand view '' of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue i highly recommend the reef and only wish it would have continued or at least had a sequel in the works ! great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning one of nora roberts better works !
i am a huge reader of history and this is one of my favorites of all time while full of interesting facts and stories it is set apart from most books by the depth of the analysis it provides it walks the line between history and social science hinting at a theory of civilization and capitalism based on case studies from around the world though professional it is not dry though i am infamous for enjoying a good dry book my only criticism of it is the parts where it ventures into the cyclic theory of history this is a european or french historiographic technique of trying to edition long recurring cycles frankly i find the concept forced even more frankly it 's bunk ! and it always annoys me when i come across it but it is part of the historical tradition braudel was involved in so it must simply be tolerated as a blemish on an otherwise stunning achievement
braudel was one of the greatest economic historians of all time his scope alone was incredible but what in the end hurt him and significantly diminished his findings was his unfamiliarity with the work of harold innis whose landmark empire and communications '' was published a quarter century before braudel published this book in the original french only innis early work on the canadian fur trade is referenced in braudel 's bibliographies his later work on information in the creation of markets is not both looked at the economics of space and time but what for braudel ended in a series of uncertain conclusions ended for innis in a profound theory of how the falling costs of information altered trade and communications patterns on a global scale put the two together and you have a clear picture of paradigm shifts over the centuries and an excellent framework for understanding outcomes in today 's globalized economy
this book is a linear commentary on the little things in life each page and comment has a picture of an animal that adds meaning to the comment always in a make you smile or outright laugh kind of way it is a gentle and sensitive light hearted book that everyone will enjoy and gain something from of course it does n't answer the big question it just gives you food for thought about it the only minus about this book is that all the pictures are in black and white color would have been so much better
i love this book everytime i read it i get something else from it my kids like it to because of the great animal pictures i have let borrow it and they had to buy their own wonderful for all ages
would recommend the book for anyone looking for a lightly thought provoking ideas
we all have those generic gift books '' that lay around in some unused corner of our dwelling you know the books with children 's letters to the tooth fairy or little flowery poems about mothers these books are hastily bought up from hallmark stores and walgreens each generic holiday and tossed in a gift bag with some chocolates and a crumy 99 cent card in our effort to conjure up a gift these are usually obligatory gifts that we feel we have to give even though we may really love and care about the recipient and feel like a jerk because we ca n't think of something else at the last minute to gift them with on our way to aunt helga 's family reunion late as usual two days later your gift book finds its self laying with other rejects at the inventory counter of your local used bookstore while the clerk groans to see yet another gifty bound volume of mushy valentines prose being continuously is the career of these books until some kind soul mercifully chucks them to the trash heap with a mighty swing of disgusted zeal i used to be there i was on both ends a shameful purchaser of these thankless books and also a silently groaning recipient of the book world 's version of fruit cake then one day upon the tank of my toilet i find this green little hardback the meaning of life laying unassumingly on the barren porcelain turf knowing my mother must have left it hoping i would take a moment from my workaholic life to indulge in a book i did just that is it awfully cheesy to say that this little book touched me most profoundly i sat reading page by page and simply breathed in the peace and stillness of just a few moments of my otherwise rigorous day the simple words in uncluttered typeset reached my heart and soul as profoundly soothing roll your eyes if you want but i 've read this book uncountable times since in both times of sorrow and joy and it has continued to have the same result on me of course the humor of these books also deserves to have a comment both the text and the unique photos on each page spread will make even the most hardened grump crack a grin a few years later and it still rests on the same spot my knowing mother left it however now it lives in a simple basket joined with bradley trevor greive 's other witty heartfelt volumes each a work in its own do yourself a favor break the syndrome and gift your love one with this true jewel of a treasure aunt helga will thank you
this book is a flip book that does not take itself too seriously i highly recommend it as far as the detractors on this website go a doctor '' believes that books like this are the cause of society 's evils why there is so many deadbeat dads '' it must be difficult for a doctor to graduate with a degree considering he can neither use proper grammer or style when writing a sentence my seven year old son could do effortlessly people can be mean spirited even about light hearted books like this one do n't listen to them
i first noticed this book in a hallmark store bought it to give to someone and read it myself first the photos are top quality shots mostly of animals mimicking various human emotions and situations they are the light side of the book the text is more weighty but brief i 'd even call it profound put together they give the reader a fun yet meaningful reading experience that makes an impact i 've since purchased additional copies for gifts
as someone who always says i am looking for the meaning of life this title caught my eye even though i did n't think it actually contained the answer it does tell you that you need to find your own meaning guess i knew that but the quotes are so true and the pictures so cute i thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that i am on the right path i look forward to the day when i 'll be excited about beginning another day and be filled with heartfelt joy '' sounds great to me ! i you are interested in this topic i would highly recommend finding your own north star claiming the life you were meant to live by martha beck good luck on your search
i really enjoyed the counterpoint of these beautiful and sometimes humorous black and white animal photographs
a simple predictable yet powerful story of an pitcher shaara 's novel is a classic baseball tale billy chapel a future who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves he is not interested in money yes this is an obvious work of fiction and pitches primarily for his love of the game '' shaara provides a unique formula for as he interweaves flashbacks of billy 's life into his final game on the mound in it shaara shows the total concentration and focused mind of an great pitcher as he progresses through his last effort as a ballplayer through flashbacks we learn of billy 's past relationships with his parents and his girl carol and during the game shaara provides simple direct descriptions of the events in an nearly detached tone indeed shaara allows us to delve into the mind of a pitcher as he pitches a perfect game although he does n't even realize this until the inning and yet the primary focus is not baseball but his retrospect on his life and his place in the world although this book may have been more polished if shaara had n't died suddenly this is still a superb book and a classic '' baseball tale for baseball purists and baseball lovers alike this should be on the of any reading list and even for fans this is still a compelling story
heard for love of the game by michael sahara a posthumously published baseball novel by the pulitzer prize winning author of the killing angels you might have to dig some to find it but your search will be worth the effort this is a short surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseball superstar who is pitching the last game of the season through a series of flashbacks you learn about his career and the one woman he loves but who is leaving him the writing is compelling and it makes you feel that you really get to know the guy plus it has you rooting for his every pitch and caring about what happens to him there 's a great ending too
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion i could be wrong
this book was eye opening for me to apply personalities and personal relationships between washington jefferson franklin hamilton and of course adams among others the vibrant times of enlightened thought in the formation of the country with the declaration of independence then in the midst of war and politics and thereafter the early years of forming the constitution and the political infighting was very interesting these were passionate men who lived in an incedible time i never had seen these founding fathers as real people before this book i recommend this read
i purchased this audiobook for my husband who listens to books while he works he never watches movies a second time and he never listens to books twice but after checking this out from the library he talked about this book so much he ended up checking it again he continued to fill me in on the life story of john adams and told me several times that he would n't mind owning this one ! needless to say he made it easy for me to decide on an anniversary gift this year and he could n't have been happier
i decided to read this book after enjoying 1776 '' i was instantly enthralled by the life of john adams mccollough is such an interesting writer and this book has been thoroughly researched i became quite connected to john adams during my reading and i was moved to tears at several points in the book i knew so little about him before reading this biography but when i completed this book i felt like i had lost a dear friend in addition to his personal life the reader will learn more about the continental congress the declaration of independance the forming of the government early foreign relations and of course all of the interesting men and women who lived during the early years of the formation of the new country this is a wonderful compelling read
the book biggest strength is that it uses many quotations of john adams abigail john quincy adams and jefferson to tell its tale these people were intelligent and very good writers i enjoyed the biography i enjoyed mccullough 's writing style and the leisurely pace he sets for himself the biography clearly portrays a man who lived long did many great things and died at peace with himself the book glosses over adams ' weaknesses and i thought spent way too much time on what jefferson and adams thought of each other but these are minor flaws i enjoyed morris 's biography of roosevelt more but this book was a good summer read and was far better than mccullough 's 1776. i learned how this nation owes a great debt to this great but flawed man
like another reviewer my interest in history is quite new the author 's presentation of john adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man david mccullough 's excerpting of adams ' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation while adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego he at the same time was critical of his own limitations even with this conflict adams could still say i thank god that he gave me stubborness when i am right '' while i read history for breadth of understanding and perspective learning the character strengths weaknesses and foibles of great men and women who accomplished much during their time on the stage challenges me to dare more and risk more in the time and place god has entrusted to me i would very much liked to have met john adams
this book is n't really for legal scholars serious historians or those interested in adams ' writings it is however a very well written personal biography of a great figure in american history with a special emphasis on trying to understand the hows and whys of adams how he responded to criticism how he came to conclusions why he made the decisions he came to etc it is difficult to provide enough color sometimes when presenting such a 'long ' life and mccullough i am sure had difficulty deciding when to slow the narrative to dwell on important events when there were so many to choose from all and all a very solid thoughtful mainstream work
what a fantastic way to learn about john adams ! what a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing ! mccullough is a brilliant and exciting writer he truly makes adams come alive and when adams inevitably dies at the end it is a very sad thing ! adams is truly a hero of the republic a great friend then a great rival then a great friend again of thomas jefferson adams is undeservedly overlooked by many students of american history adams the republican vs jefferson the populist was the great debate in american history and still continues today adams saw the horror of the french revolution for what it was and predicted that it would end in depravity and violence and likely cause a savage reaction which would bring about the end of the french republic itself he was right bonaparte quickly followed the french revolution and war across europe was the result jefferson on the other hand embraced the french revolution as an expression of the people 's desire for liberty how wrong he was ! adams was a brilliant statesman and student of history a wonderful family man and superb husband adams ' correspondence with his wife abigail is a classic in american literature as a youth i spent many hours on the grounds of the adams mansion soaking up all the history there as much as is possible mccullough does so well what so many biographers do so poorly and that is he captures the times of the subject and places the person in his rightful context he brought me back to the grounds of peacefield '' through his beautiful evocations of it as it hosted great people and great events history is best studied by understanding how historical figures lived and understood their own lives and times as they lived them hindsight is an overrated tool in historiography bringing the past to life in writing is a special gift and mccullough has it enjoy his talents and get to know the foundations of the american nation a story that is not fully known by so many adams ' story deserves to be told what a brilliant man and mccullough does him superb justice in this highly readable biography so much can be said here about adams but it 's not necessary as mccullough has written the definitive john adams biography and says it better than get to know john adams through this superb book you will be glad that you did and your opinions on jefferson will likely change too ! 10 stars !
as a newer student of history i 'm fascinated by all of the research and reconstruction that goes into putting together biographies of some of our early leaders this book is no exception the story at times becomes a little bogged down in details that can distract but overall the reading is easy and the content stays with the reader
simply outstanding mccullough brings history alive it 's not history '' it 's a real story it may not be perfect historically but it 's pretty darn good and there is no such thing as perfect '' anyway when it comes to history it is perfect however when it comes to conveying it 's vivid it 's fully understandable it 's exciting and it 's not hyped because history at that period of time and the life and role of adams was so exciting i love it i love it i love it

i 've been tearing through nevada barr 's anna pigeon mysteries ever since i discovered them the tighest and best story in my opinion is firestorm this one was a little harder to follow and i 'm not sure i ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery but like with all the pigeon novels the characters and physical setting were interesting and and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing such as the relationship between anna and her sister and the relationship between anna and frederick the fbi agent be prepared to be surprised ! i do n't think i 'm going to read anything else until i 've finished all the anna pigeon books out there on to blind descent !
i love listening to this book as cindy williams has an enjoyable voice and does a good job reading the story is enjoyable as well but it is so changed from the book at times it bares little resembelence to it i am not referring to the fact it is abridged and much is left out i refer to the fact for example that a character that is a man in the book is a woman on the tape such changes alter the structure of the story and make it into a different story than the one you expect to hear if you have not read the book this is a moot point but if you have your in for some surprises
anna is in the south again but this time on one of the islands off the coast of georgia and she 's not 'wrastlin ' gators this time it 's turtles instead there 's a plane crash bambi real name flicka cannibus marijuana and more she 's still contemplating moving to chicago to be with the distant frederick but that possibility seems to always be on the backburner as usual nevada fights the good fight goes skinny dipping gets her hair cut and is finally free of her in a hilarious manner while discovering the the secrets of cumberland island 's murders
i was not familiar with thomas friedman 's new york times columns this book contains a sampling of his columns the book mainly portrays the difference in the arab the culture of the west the book opens with the shock of the events of considered a tragedy by the west and a cause for celebration for many places in the arab and muslim world the author goes onto explain the arab world 's rage against america is the result of the idea that america represents globalization modernity plurality muslim populations in the middle east are generally ruled by oppressive regimes that are failing their populace providing a limited world vision while censoring information the author made an interesting observation india has the second largest muslim population of any country in the world but the muslim rage in not present as the author notes chanting death to america '' is not the favored occupation of its populace the reason india is a democracy the people are concerned with bettering themselves through government and so it goes the author 's main point is that when the middle east can be democratized and the poverty alleviated it will be ready to join the modern world i really believe tom freidman is right on target with the ideas within this book
friedman 's writing is consistently thoughtful and this book is no exception i appreciate deeply the care with which this book has been prepared it belongs in every thinking person 's library
thomas friedman 's longitudes and attitudes '' is a very readable book based on a collection of columns he wrote for the new york times just before the attacks of and for the year following those attacks the last quarter of the book contains a kind of diary in which he attempts to put into context where he was in the world when he wrote these columns and how he was personally feeling at the time it is a very personal collection often invoking the image of his children 's future friedman 's primary mission as he relates it in meetings with educated people across the middle east is his search for the rationale of the terrorists why they killed and how they were radicalized he frequently relates how depressed he got when talking to educated middle easterners who unflinchingly believed in conspiracy theories of the highest order the most common canard he constantly ran across was that four thousand jews were notified on the morning of not to go to the world trade towers another astonishing fact '' he constantly confronted from academics clerics and the media in the middle east was that there is no proof that muslims were the hijackers in the first place in general friedman relates most muslims in the middle east also believe that the attack was a plot by the cia or jews to discredit muslims and that all the american media is run by jews throughout the book friedman does not shy away from the fact that he is jewish he is balanced and critical of both sides in the conflict decrying the brutality of the israelis and palestinians and he especially singles out the stubbornness of arafat in that arab leader 's failure to accept the clinton peace plan which would have given palestinians a state encompassing 95 of what they asked for and could have stanched the bloodshed friedman relates his amazement that the middle east is bombarded by an incessant attack in the arab media upon israel and the united states particularly via tv programs that run through the night simply playing martial music and showing images of israeli brutality against palestinians which is always portrayed as he is unabashedly and constantly critical of the saudi arabia regime from which we are frequently reminded was home to 15 of the nineteen hijackers friedman seems particularly upset that saudi arabia did not apologize for the involvement of its nationals in the attack against the us and has refused to cooperate with the fbi in their investigation he also makes it abundantly clear that saudi arabia along with iran seem to be in a race to provide money to islamic madras 's across the globe that teach virulent intolerance and hatred against america and israel friedman does n't simpy rail against the world as he sees it he does prescribe some remedies for what he refers to as an ongoing clash of civilizations '' a term he borrows from samuel huntington if we do n't address the tumult we find ourselves in and usama bin laden wins '' friedman warns us that the war of civilizations will be coming to a theater near to you '' first and foremost he calls upon arab nations to forge a new future for their citizens by letting go of the past and looking to the future too often arab nations and leaders deflect true change by blaming all their troubles on someone else their problems are america 's fault or bush 's fault or israel 's fault and so on ad infinitum true leaders in the middle east should create plans for the future not just laying blame for present and past real and perceived slights arab leaders should come up with plans for educating their children making governments more responsive and creating jobs for the exploding number of young people in the middle east friedman goads arab leaders by saying things such as while other emerging nations make microchips you are making potato chips '' and that the gdp of spain is greater than that of all 22 arab states combined friedman could be called a liberal hawk he firmly believes in globalization with a caveat that the internet can be an open sewer '' he also believes that the concept of engaging and talking with your enemy is the only way that problems can truly be resolved an example the and israel engaged arafat and came up with a plan that gave the palestinians a state encompassing 95 of what they wanted this pleased friedman the liberal arafat torched the olive branch that was extended to him and friedman the hawk reminds us that arafat had many maps that did not even show modern israel on them friedman the hawk also applauded the fall of saddam from a humanitarian viewpoint reminding us that saddam killed more muslims in the century than any other individual and asked his readers to give the cia a break '' and give war a chance '' one of the most important ideas this book relates is that unlike christianity and the jewish faith islam never went though enlightenment or a reformation what this means is that islam never separated church and state the way that the west has done and therefore islam has not been able to move its society and culture forward because of the constant influence of clerics who ca n't effectively run a modern nation lastly the last quarter of the book that was written in a diary format was primarily a rehash of ideas spelled out earlier in the book merely reformatted to fit the geographic contours of where and when friedman wrote his columns this part of the book added little new information and seemed that it was almost an afterthought an awkward attempt to tie together all the canned columns
this book is a collection of newspaper columns and journal entries that friedman wrote before and after the september attacks friedman is very familiar with the middle east having been a news correspondent in beirut and jerusalem for ten years before becoming foreign affairs columnist for the new york times although he himself had stressed that one consequence of globalization has been the creation of individuals with a grudge against the united states and that bin laden was just such an individual the lexus and the olive tree even friedman did not see it coming on september 2001. this book features reprints of friedman 's columns analyzing the reasons why the september attacks happened and the reaction in the following months throughout the islamic world the book also includes a short journal section in which friedman describes his travels in the middle east while he was collecting material for his columns the events of september 2001 found me and my husband in a lebanese restaurant in the dubai neighborhood where we had been living for four years the waiters were listening to the radio and from all the cheers and excitement we thought some arab country was winning a world cup soccer match against a european powerhouse but the waiters would n't look at us finally one came over and with a face that alternated between embarrassment concern and glee told us something big had happened in the we went home immediately to check the news on cnn the following day arab colleagues would give us their condolences but not long afterwards every one of them told us they believed the cia and mossad were behind the attacks and that no arabs were involved bin laden 's face appeared on the wallpaper of my emirati students ' computers and cell them he was clearly a hero not a demon in seeking to understand the events i read the newspaper daily and was amazed that friedman with a new york byline could be so well informed about what we were seeing all around us while i do n't agree with everything that friedman espouses in this book i think his analysis of the muslim world following september is about as accurate as any western journalist could develop friedman is a fierce patriot for all the right reasons he lived overseas long enough to appreciate the qualities that make america great he reminds us that american power and wealth flow directly from a deep spiritual spirit of respect for the individual a spirit of tolerance for differences of faith or politics a respect for freedom of thought as the necessary foundation for all creativity and a spirit of unity that encompasses all kinds of differences lord knows ours is hardly a perfect country many times we have deviated from the american spirit or applied it selfishly but it is because we come back to this spirit more times than not in more communities than not that our country remains both strong and renewable '' friedman notes it will be a tragedy if arabs and muslims adopt the position that there is no conceivable reason why americans might be upset with them today and that any criticism they face in the media is entirely the result of some jewish campaign of vilification a people reduces all its problems to a conspiracy by someone else it absolves itself and its leaders of any responsibility for its any need for no civilization has ever prospered with that approach only in a society that embraces can the political process produce real facts to cope with real problems standard view of america in the world is that america is rich and powerful because it is crass and materialistic the truth is exactly the opposite america is successful and wealthy because of its values not despite them it is prosperous because of the way it respects freedom individualism and women 's rights and the way it nurtures creativity and experimentation '' according to friedman although arabs will point to us support for israel as the reason behind the anger against the us the real reasons for arab anger come down to stagnating domestic arab economies and autocratic governments which permit anger to be expressed only about the occupation of palestine he notes how governments support imams and how the arabic media presents images of israeli violence unceasingly on television thus even those who are not drawn to religious institutions are kept perpetually angry but their anger is safely diverted from domestic issues in an october 2001 column friedman points out since september 11 the president of the united states has given several speeches about how islam is a tolerant religion with no core hostility to the west but the leader of saudi arabia the keeper of the muslim holy places has n't given one '' in trying to understand the deeper message of friedman writes while the world is being globalized shrunk and tied together ever more closely in technological terms this has not been accompanied by a better mutual understanding between cultures countries and civilizations there is a mismatch we are technologically culturally and politically as far apart as ever at least among certain communities '' in one of my favorite columns of the book changing the channel '' friedman presents a analysis of why watching the golf channel is a lot more fun than watching the news from the middle east when i returned home from the middle east myself my first inclination was to wall myself off from news about the region because it made me angry but friedman argues this is in the long term the only answer is to figure out ways to change the attitudes and intentions of the people on the other side of the wall or at least narrow the gap between differing cultures and political traditions so we can share this shrinking planet '' that 's a challenging undertaking
i remember back in the day when i was a blind follower of michael moore and al franken thinking that tom friedman was some right wing jerk for no real reason either he just seemed to fit that mold to an extremely naive liberal it certainly makes me uncomfortable to think back to those days because i am now a pragmatic and realistic moderate and i certainly had friedman pegged wrong and also because i now realize moore and franken are mostly useless longitudes and attitudes is a collection of friedman 's new york times columns from to plus a short travel diary at the end that takes some of the stories from the columns and fleshes them out a bit to provide more details and context the book 's format makes it amazingly easy to read and friedman 's writing style is superb he does a fantastic job at communicating his ideas in an easy to understand fashion i did n't agree with everything he said in these columns but he really made me think about what i thought about certain issues i think that 's the sign of a great writer and analyst especially when i think of the subject matter he writes about i 'm glad someone like friedman is out there because i really do think that if more people in america read his books and columns with an open mind this country would be better off for it my only real complaint that i feel warranted mentioning here is that friedman hinted several times at the lack of muslim response to as if there were no muslims that condemned the attacks i 'm sure friedman talked to a great many people all over the world but there were quite a few muslim sources of outrage and condemnation after i wish he would have perhaps looked a little harder to find them i think this would be a great book for anyone even remotely interested about terrorism foreign policy etc to read i certainly plan on reading the rest of his books and look forward to what he will produce in the future
tom friedman is a engaging writer he also writes from a very personal perspective both as to how the world has changed for him and his family and for his friends around the world you get the feeling that friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching what a treat and a very easy read pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the us shores
tom friedman has a regular column in the new york times i have always loved his columns and this book is excellent it is actually a collection of his ny times columns a must read for anyone who is interested in politics in the middle east terrorism and its origin and the iraq war
tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching and walls states markets individuals and the comprehensive failure of the arab street leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the extremely well from reading this compilation of nyt columns i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current book 'the world is flat ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions his ability to see the big picture is spot on
may not make you wise my immediate response right after finishing the last page of this book had the author published a new book after this to my very disappointment the answer is negative i am a chinese living in hong kong who knew very little about the middle east beforehand this book is really an eye opener to me i couldnt imagine that in 2002 there are now prostitutes operating on the streets of tehran and 250 brothels 60 new runaway girls hitting tehran 's streets everyday forty percent of all drug addicted women in iranian prisons have aids unemployment which is already around 30 percent is steadily rising '' pg 280 of course this book is not about showing bad looking statistics from credible middle east sources it preached viable solutions that bush had not adopted to name a few frankly i hope saddam disappears tomorrow but even if he does that 's not going to solve our problem saddam is a conventional threat who can be eliminated by conventional means he inspires no one the idea people who inspired the hijackers are religious leaders pundits and educators primiarily in eygpt and in saudia arabia which continues to use its vast oil wealth to spread its austere and intolerant brand of islam wahabism june 2002 '' pg 265 and if we 've learned one thing since it 's that terrorism is not produced by the poverty of money it 's produced by the poverity of dignity it is about young middle class arabs and muslims feeling trapped in countries with too few good jobs and too few opportunities to realize their potential or shape their own future and blaming america for it we have to break the cycle june 2002 '' pg 270 to counter the pro american impression from the examples i quoted above this is not to say that us policy is blameless we do bad things sometimes but why is it that only muslims react to our bad policies with suicidal terrorism not mexians or chinese is it because jews could not be so strong on their own the united states created and supports israel mar 2002 '' pg 197 and bush has repeatedly told the world if you 're not with us you 're against us he needs to remember this the rest of the world is saying the same thing to us march 2002 '' pg 207 in short a well written book of wisdom it 's ideas are really true useful and can pass the test of time especially after the bombings in london last thursday dont miss it
written in the context of the cold war the author emphasizes the need for free markets and an open society for a society to property function it stresses the importance of the individual and the needs of the individual against the backdrop of an ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country '' era and the basic economic honesty of selfishness in general there are several ideas in the book that probably need to be revisited which is why you should read it since they are becoming issues again in today 's world
an favorite of mine capitalism freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the state 's distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations from the classic liberal 's perspective this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government and strictly limits the appropriateness of state involvement in society particularly with regard to programs and policy friedman uses this foundation to build a case for limited government in economic matters citing in particular the consequences of monetary and fiscal policy abuse in an exceptionally apt comparison friedman argues that the same rationale that limits government interference with free speech should likewise apply to government interference in the economy namely that constraints be applied to monetary and fiscal policy to limit the potential for government to do harm in its pursuit of doing good friedman gives numerous examples in which government officials exercising economic authority have further aggravated economic crises by applying a standardh to different economic scenarios having clearly laid out his political philosophy friedman builds his case for detailing control measures intrinsic of a economy from floating exchange rates to schooling union contracts to charity friedman argues that the harnesses the productive potential of millions of individuals and corporations reconciling their preferences in a competitive process far more efficiently than any collective body throughout the book friedman debunks popular myths disputes misunderstandings and challenges the conventional wisdom prevalent among intellectuals and social elites of his day and ours the book 's only drawback is its age and somewhat antiquated writing style that would certainly make it difficult for some readers to fully understand particularly those who are victims of public school education '' friedman references several examples that would have been more easily recognized in the but will not be immediately familiar to younger readers still this brilliant work presents the core principles of capitalism and classic liberalism in a relatively clear manner and is a for anyone studying the dynamics of and free societies
this book probably should not be treated as capitalist manifesto '' a la marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous galbraith the affluent society '' 1958 reading the book without reading galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian style but as a polemic with galbraith vision of society the book looks like an interesting historical document in his book galbraith stressed that to become successful america should invest heavily in infrastructure highways phone infrastructure etc as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention at the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role he also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies and most of their profits are expropriated by banks landlords and state in essence he argued that the usa society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism planning for the largest firms and government macroeconomics with limited free market '' capitalism for small fish microeconomics many argues that gm troubles proved that galbraith was wrong but if you look at gm problems it 's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed detroit friedman definitly was the most intellectually astute opponent of galbraith society vision he pointed out that the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically but most of the content of the book is detached from reality and looks like a draft of yet another utopia sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of free market '' suggests that he is closer to socialists especially trotskyites then conservatives and from defender of status quo '' turned into promoter of a new and dangerous social utopia a new economic messiah who preached that free market fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion per year will save mankind freidman 's absolutization of the market in goldman sacks we trust '' using galbraith catch phase as well as advocacy of fiat money he played a role in the usa unilateral withdrawal from gold standard in a way makes friedman 's views very similar to marxists extremes meet although his utopia proved to be definitly less costly for mankind it 's funny that the latest administration that proclaims market markets '' and praise friedman actually behaves more like military keynesians '' then free market '' advocates the same was true for reagan still it was during reagan 's years when conservatism had grown into more and more dangerously utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society freidman 's arguments that planning is unnecessary and that market forces have checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views statists for readers in 2006 and especially european readers it 's clear that friedman 's views of the market are and free market '' described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control by the government level greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose the opposite is also true and market tend to influence government in many ways especially dangerous if there are large national firms which depends on government contracts military industrial complex some proposed in his book solutions '' like eliminating medical profession licensing in the name of free market are pretty bizarre it looks like the main problem with friedman 's book is that unlike galbraith he did not understand the importance of balancing government power with the freedom for market forces extreme positions that proclaim advantage of a single social force always look extremely dangerous for example if everything is just a free market '' why buying politicians should be prohibited is not this a discrimination against free market the same question is applicable to judiciary what about the danger of natural creation of heredary elite by market forces and resulting natural '' conversion of parliamentary democracy into oligarchy like iron law of oligarchy '' presuppose failing to address those problems makes his book mostly irrelevant for the reader in 2006 but still important as a historical document that criticized galbraith views it was galbraith who coined the term countervailing power '' today we face the fundamental question at which point '' '' unrestricted market '' and associated with it corruption of government should be stopped and some too hot crooked practitioners probably jailed and where and when unchecked state powers expansion should be stopped preferably with similar type of punishment to prevent sliding of society into also stagnant and completely corrupt version of well developed socialism brezhnev 's style '' society probably needs to deal with the market the way tennis players deal with tennis racket if player holds it too tightly his game suffer but is holds it too loose he can not play well either in this respect former socialist countries '' were not so much socialist the famous joke in the ussr was that any capitalist '' european country contains more communists then the whole ussr but countries with too powerful and unbalanced by any other forces government and it was probably the internally grown oligarchy and not initiated by reagan arm race military keysianism '' that eventually defeated communist party control of the state the oligarchy the was naturally created by the state after wwii and consisted to a large extent of party members in high positions they were direct beneficiaries of the system collapse that happened with blessing and probably financial help of those oligarchs under the weight of economic problems and siege of nationalist forces in a way we can believe in the theory of convergence '' both unrestricted free market forces '' and unrestricted government control eventually lead to the rule of oligarchy i am not an economist but it looks very strange that an avid advocate of free market '' is at the same time a proponent of demonetarization of gold and usage of fiat currencies in this sense his bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel often incorrectly called nobel prize in economics looks somewhat strange with fiat currencies all businesses are hostages of the government and the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient usually to cover war expenses provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup how stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen it should be noted that lately freeman himself abandoned his monetarist views '' and that makes chapter iii one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity but unfortunately britain already serves as a guinea pig for his utopia as for implementing his and other economic utopias i like the quote attributed to german iron canceller otto von bismarck about suggestion of one of german parliamentarians to implement socialism i do not remember exact wording but it sounded like this ok let 's do it but let 's first choose for this experiment a country that we do not care about ''
in only 202 pages who said professors ca n't boil things down to the essentials free market solutions are outlined to address some of our most serious problems this is a book the ideas contained in it if properly applied could improve our economy and enhance our freedom at the same time
milton friedman now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia capitalism and freedom '' dispels the myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society the book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made however they are points that never go out of sytle he refutes the lie that the caused the depression it was actually a tyrannical federal reserve that socialism can be democratic and others friedman discusses public education roads minimum wage laws which he calls the most law on the books '' as well as the how progressive '' tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor please understand that friedman is not a '' extremist as some knucklehead below states he is a libertarian he developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor his ideas were to help people not hurt them with the someone who says otherwise does n't know what they 're talking about
one of my faves friedman was one of the best also read the road to serfdom by hayek as for reviewer turner the good news is that your lobotomy is reversible there are a lot of brilliant about these days reading thomas sowell for starters just may restore your mind of course if it 's your heart that 's the problem putting forth a man like lenin who said '' it would not matter if of the human race perished the important thing is that the remaining be communist '' an paragon of compassion '' is truly pathetic ! yeah the compassionate '' followers of marx trotsky lenin mao pol pot have thus far liberated '' by mass murder between 95 and 150 million souls purges pogroms and killing fields ! no other political party in human history has shed so much blood in the space of a single century and turner 's colon is is knots over a goldwater cartoon ! give me a break
this book is the apotheosis of freedom friedman should be studied not only by economists but also by politicians definitely a must
milton friedman is one of the great economic thinkers of the century based out of the university of chicago this nobel prize winner in economics has consistently and cogently argued for the benefits of capitalism over any other form of economic organization this along with free to choose '' are his two major works establishing and explaining his beliefs within it he argues against many established policies in the us federal government such as the minimum wage subsidies rent controls and licensing requirements for practice in fields such as medicine and law likewise he argues for many alternatives to today 's arrangements such as increasing the use of school vouchers the author argues that the concepts of capitalism are very similar to the concepts of democracy and that the spread of one helps the spread of the other and hence both should go in terms of public policy this book along with his other writings are the bedrock of economic conservatism and its creations such as savings accounts school vouchers tradeable pollution emission allowances etc by reading this book one gains a very thorough understanding of american conservatism unfortunately the book minimizes the power of corporations and financial markets speculators the book also does not pay enough attention to the mining and energy industries two sectors of the economy which often produce scandal and disasters when given over to the rule of forces enron last the author misses one key difference between democracy and capitalism in democracy one person gets one vote in capitalism this is rarely the case some individuals will end up having more dollars more votes than other individuals overall a good book though not a great one the book 's arguments are well made and warrant understanding though they are by no means universally correct
it is amazing how little has changed in our political dialogue in the years since this book was written friedman had chapters about social responsibility of business taxes and incentives free trade vouchers and the role of government in the education system and fair '' distributions of income and trade protectionism to protect domestic industries and workers from unfair foreign competition '' friedman compellingly argues that capitalism is the best means of promoting freedom man has yet devised he observes that underlying most arguements against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself '' people who speak of failures of the market are generally actually referring to market outcomes that are inconsistent with their views of propriety he makes the telling point that politics forces conformity in decision making some form of majority decides issues making that decision binding on all market forces reduce strain on the social fabric by rendering conformity unecessary '' it seems obvious then that the more decisions we leave to individuals the more free we will be as a society i found it interesting that much that friedman is criticized for is done on fallacious grounds he very clearly sees a role for government government should do the things the market can not do for itself the most important of which is enforce the rules of the game and adjudicate disputes over the interpretation of those rules further government can be profitably involved when neighboorhood effects or externalities are present he rightly cautions against the continued extension of neighboorhood effects often just an excuse for a group looking for a special dispensation he cautions us that one of the things we should fear most is the concentration of power this is especially relevant today given the continuing expansion of our federal government he makes the interesting point that high marginal tax rates are impediments to becoming wealthy rather than a tax on being wealthy this is right on the money and may help to explain why americans of all income groups are opposed to very high marginal tax rates on income groups above their own this is something the left should take note of i also found his point that very high tax rates caused the wealthy to be much more risk averse to be quite revealing the wealthy of the time properly perceived that with high marginal tax rates the wealth they had was all the wealth they would ever have when washington took 91 of your marginal income the odds were low that you would ever recoup a significant capital loss i do n't think it is a coincidence that as those rates have dropped the american economy has grown faster and become the premier innovator and new business developer in the world finally he has some interesting observations on the motivations of the egalitarians in society he draws a great distinction between equality of rights and equality of outcome the left insists on the latter he feels the focus should be on the former the conversion of the american intellectuals to has always puzzled me how could people seemingly so intelligent espouse a system that has never been effective anywhere it has been tried friedman suggest that the conversion of the intellectuals was achieved by a comparison between the existing state of affairs with all its injustices and defects and a hypothetical state of affairs as it might be emphasis mine the actual was compared with the ideal '' it now seems fairly well proven that the ideal is unattainable and also undesirable for those of a libertarian bent this will be a great read for those of a collectivist bent but an open mind this is well worth the time and may change your mind just a bit
i like these first but then i just stopped reading them and i have no idea why klaus is the middle child in this trio he is amazingly smart violet can build inventions out of anything ! and the youngest person in this trio is a girl named sunny who has amazingly sharp front teeth i love the plot of these books count olaf is a great character and i love to hate him ! i juat have to read the twelfth book and then i 've read them all i definetely plan to read the next book in this series
these books are some of the most incredibly creative and oringinal books i have ever read i may be seventeen but i absolutley love thse books my best friend ashton let me borrow them and i read the first one and i was hooked no other author i have read can write as cleverly as he can i could never choose a favorite i love every one
the books i received were in very good condition i feel it took a bit long to actually receive the items especially due to the fact that i have ordered from other vendors before and saw a much faster turnaround
prime pasta perfect pasta that 's the only kind served by the authors in their providence restaurant al forno billy joel claims their pizza is the best in the world while i would n't argue with him for me the easy to follow recipes offered in this imaginative enormously satisfying cookbook are among the best to be found the author 's love and enthusiasm for the type of food they prepare is obvious on every page as they experiment create and enjoy explaining that work nights end late for them they add that they 're hungry so together they prepare what they call midnight spaghetti '' it 's really a competition between the two of them with simple rules prepare a delicious sauce in the time it takes for a pot of water to boil and the pasta to cook '' among the dishes favored for these nocturnal feasts are spaghetti with fresh spinach and gorgonzola pantry spaghetti vintner 's spaghetti pappardelle with olives thyme and lemon recipes for these and other pasta dishes whether appetizers or main courses are found in this temptingly illustrated book of enormous help are the hints offered by this couple who have cooked tens of thousands of pounds of pasta at their restaurant for instance a good rule of thumb is four ounces of pasta per person as a main meal and half of that for a starter plus a list of for your pasta pantry is indispensable and saves hasty runs to the super market could n't possibly choose a favorite from the many recipes offered but high on my list is jo 's fast cheater 's '' lasagne granted i 'm biased as pasta has always been a favorite dish and i tend to heartily agree with the authors ' admonition do n't trust people who do n't like pasta '' highly recommended enjoy ! gail cooke
my title is way to simplistic for this story but it gives you an idea tananarive due brings us a unique look into suspense and horror that i have not seen before giving us a cultural lesson at the same time an engrossing read i could n't put it down
from the minute i opened the book i could n't stop reading it 's refreshing to read such an entertaining novel from start to finish !
i absolutely loved this novel i usually read banks vampire huntress series but i decided in a slight change of pace and boy did i get it the story is about a woman trying to run away from her tragic past with her child gone from a freak accident angela does n't know how to bounce back after advice from a friend she decides to pick up the pieces from its point of origin her grandmother 's old house this is a great ghost story but it involves so much more it 's a ghost story a mystery a drama and of course due uses a certain traditional african american religion as the basis of the novel at times i feel like the author was channeling steven king and i really did enjoy it while the pace was a little slow in some parts the mystery of the story strings the reader along unlike due 's novel joplin 's ghost the action starts on the first page and gets the reader invested
i listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel and what can i say i loved it i 've never read anything before by this author but the narration the spinechilling series of events and the loveable characters made me want to read more i sincerely hope there is a sequel the story involves an ancient curse placed upon a woman 's family which is unwittingly unleashed by her likeable teenage son cory cory 's family must bear the brunt of a demon 's tricks and wrath which does at times have fatal consequences i particularly liked naomi and onyx i really do feel taht tananarive can write excellent male characters her male characters seem very realistic and heartfelt 5 stars
i found the good house to be an exceptionally well written and suspenseful novel the author did an excellent job of developing the story and the characters there were only two minor drawbacks to the book one was that at times i found it too frightening to read at night but then again that 's why people read books like this also i agree with others who have pointed out that the ending is a bit on the hollywood side however neither of these was enough to prevent me from giving the book a 5 rating this was my first book by due but it most certainly wo n't be the last
i really enjoyed this book it kept me guessing what would happen next i did n't want to put it down
angela toussaint has nothing but warm wonderful memories of her grandmother marie and summers at the good house and while her haitian grandmother evokes only thoughts of goodness in angela the fact is that her grandmother was a very powerful voodoo priestess who was widely known for her powers angela is also blissfully unaware that many years prior her grandmother driven to do so by anger pride and a need for vengeance summoned a spirit that would only mean death and destruction for her descendants being the powerful priestess that she was she was able to put the demon to sleep it has lay dormant within the earth of the good house all of these years returning to the small town of sacajawea washington with her son cory as she has done many times before a simple task of cleaning the attic has sparked young corey 's curiosity in his grandmother and before you know it he is pouring through her book of spells and trying some of her magic magic that eventually unleashes the fury of a being that has been dormant for almost a century bringing with it death and destruction to all of the toussaints fabulously tale that draws the reader in with the very first paragraph too scary to read alone yet too wonderful to put down i have found a new favorite in this author dy
a must for dog owners and a guide to go by for ' instead of costly obedience classes
the intelligence of dogs by stanley coren takes a unique approach to assessing the intelligence of our canine companions coren is a psychologist and animal behaviorist and uses some innovative methods typically used to measure human intelligence on dogs he gives interesting background information on canines and how philosophers once viewed them as biological machines incapable of thinking or feeling this book would be helpful to a person trying to decide on a breed for a pet because of the breed specific information provided i highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in man 's best friend and whats going on in his mind
this was a book that i found absolutely delightful to read since i am a dog nut the topic seized my attention immediately and coren did not disappoint his style is lucid and thankfully free of a lot of jargon this made for pleasant and informative reading enjoy
in this the intelligence of dogs a guide to the thoughts emotions and inner lives of our canine companions stanley coren looks at how dogs think and what they feel by analyzing their actions he begins by providing a persuading argument that dogs do think and show emotions then an interesting history is given of the views on the dog 's mind throughout history along with the three main proposed views of what dogs were first domesticated and used by people coren provides a few sections that are especially useful in interpreting what your dog is thinking or trying to say i am a veterinary assistant and am around a lot of dogs all day and these lists did provide me with some new information the book also talks about the three different kinds of intelligence that dogs have coren clearly describes adaptive working and instinctive intelligence with the use of many personal examples these examples are often interesting and entertaining to the reader while strengthening coren 's point in addition coren provides tips for the reader to evaluate his own dog 's intelligence i found the canine intelligence test and the personality test to be a fun activity for both me and my dog the intelligence test helps you understand how your dog 's intelligence compares to the rest of the dog world the personality test determines what kind of personality your dog has and what the best techniques are for training it the last few chapters of the book describe useful techniques for increasing a dog 's intelligence and an description of how the dog 's brain works the tips for improving my dog 's intelligence seem to be really practical the explanation of the science of the dog 's brain is surprisingly easy to comprehend coren explains the brain 's complexity in everyday terms overall this book is very informative of the dog 's mind and it also seems to be partly biographical with all of coren 's stories and explanations of how he reaches his conclusions and conducts his research this slight mixture of genres keeps me from becoming bored with an only informative book i definitely recommend this book to any dog enthusiasts that are looking for an informative and entertaining book to read
i ca n't believe i did n't know anything about this time in us history before the chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating this book is very well written you 'd think a book about architecture might be dry but its really not at all highly recommend this book its a slo a great book for a book club
one of the best books ever and i read 2 a mont
as a criminologist i have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one the research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures this is a must read for anyone interested history the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the relationship bravo to larson
reads like a murder mystery but represents itself as being factual a really incredible story and a piece that should be read by all chicagoans i live in colorado but was born there fran
extraordinarily well written highly recommeded for anyone interested in not just chicago history but turn of the century events
a fascinating look into chicago 's life and times at the end of the century with the background of the world 's fair and the personalities of the major movers and shakers of the era
a strangly fascinating book did n't expect it to be so engrossing lived in chicago for a time and find i knew little about the history the parallel plot was a stroke of genius the bright lights the century of progress and the horror that was patiently waiting in the shadows ! ! just terrific ! !
i learned some odd new things reading this fascinating made me do more research on the exposition
this book had me from the first line a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction two stories are told side by side one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes jack the ripper pale by comparison the result is a book that is almost impossible to put down it left me with an appreciation of the energy talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world 's fair and the genius of inventors like george ferris
not only is the story heartwarming the artwork is beautiful besides having this book in my personal library i have purchased several copies for friends with dogs and give it as remembrance when their beloved pet goes to the rainbow bridge it is definitely appropriate for any occasion but there is a certain comfort when it is received during the difficult time after a pet is gone anyone who loves dogs has to love this book
for anyone who has loved lost a dog this book is peace for the soul since not many people know how to express condolences over the loss of a pet this is a great place to make a memorial steve did a great job expressing the love and joy of having a friend with his humor and expressive illustrations
while attending a conference in vermont i was fascinated by several woodcuts of dogs by folk artist stephen huneck which were displayed in a local craft store the ones which particularly caught my interest involved labrador retrievers engaged in simple tasks which captured the essence of the breed loyalty friendliness joyfulfulness and perserverance i then noticed that the artist also had published three children 's books incorporating woodcuts of his black labrador retriever sally at the beach in the mountains and on the farm however the book to which i was drawn both by the storyline and the pictures supplementing and illustrating the text was the dog chapel i learned that the author and his wife in fact live in johnsbury vt with their four dogs and that he has constructed the dog chapel on his farm as a place that welcomes visitors of all creeds and all breeds but with no dogmas allowed '' the preface briefly and movingly describes the near death experience which transformed the artist 's because that is the real occupation of this author life and led to the construction of the chapel the book is also movingly dedicated to sally the black lab and his constant companion who helped nurse him back to health after he miraculously awoke from his coma but was unable to speak or move during his recuperation he was inspired or as he puts it he had the wild idea to build the chapel to commemorate and share with others the messages my dogs have taught me about the nature of love joy friendship play trust faith and peace '' the next several pages of the book consist of gorgeous photographs of both the interior and exterior of the chapel they succeed in capturing its simple beauty in the marvelous setting of the vermont hills there are simple stained glass windows and wonderful woodcarvings the artist also is a sculptor and artisan who fashions hand carved furniture as well as the accommodations being enjoyed by both human beings and their dogs of course the chapel has its own dog door the remainder and overwhelming majority of the book is then devoted to woodcuts illustrating the various attributes and encapsulating the sort of experiences which lead to the deep bond which forms between people and their dogs this is a book to be savored and repeatedly enjoyed it is the sort of book to be left on the table next to your favorite chair so you can open it up and smile at the pictures which capture the essence of some of your favorite moments with your dog it can also serve to ease the deep pain from the loss of a canine companion finally it will then be conveniently at hand for the enjoyment of any guests who also happen to be doglovers of course given the prominence of retrievers in huneck 's artwork the book probably had some extra added attraction for me since we currently own a black lab mix and a golden retriever and still mourn the death several years ago of our yellow lab great dane mix although the price might seem a little expensive for such a slim volume the cover and the binding are of high quality and the pages display the artwork to great advantage i highly recommend this book and as the commentary accompanying one of the illustrations suggests after buying the book if you feel that you are too old to play perhaps your next task should be to buy a ball and a dog to go with it '' tucker anderse
this book is amazing i recently lost my beloved companion of 9 years and when i saw this book i had to buy it i am proud to say i 'm originally from vermont and have been a fan of steven huneck for years he has outdone himself with the dog chapel '' the illustrations and simple phrases reflect the love between a dog and his person i miss my friend but huneck 's book has helped me to grieve and heal
hunek conveys the power of the bond through beautiful photos of the chapel and whimsical woodcuts that describe the characteristics of our canine companions the book tells how this unique chapel came to be built following the authors critical illness as the sign outside the chapel says all breeds and all creeds welcome no dogma allowed '' this book would make a cherished gift for all dog lovers regardless of their religious or spiritual beliefs
this is a wonderful book for the creative spirit or crafty mom instead of spending your hard earned cash on flimsy costumes that may get only one wear you can make your own it includes a multitude of colorful photos and easy to follow instructions to make many exciting and unique costumes some of them include a king robot knight in shining armour magician cowboy and hula girl this would be a great book to use for halloween costumes as well as for dress up and role play many of the costumes can be made by kids themselves it will save you money and the kids will have a great time
i enjoyed this book because most of the items for making the costumes you can find around the house
this book is creepy if you like ghost stories with a twist its pretty good i enjoyed this book however its not my favorite the reason i gave it a 4 star is because it maintained my interest
ask a king fan what book is his best and you will most likely hear it '' or the stand '' as the answer maybe the occasional the shining '' or you may have asked a dark tower fan who puts those books above and beyond the rest of the canon as for me i 'd simply say bag of bones '' i 've read almost everything king 's done and a lot of it is great really great he 's easily my favorite author but in my opinion nothing he 's written has topped bag of bones i do n't want to say much about the story as you really need to just experience it yourself but it is poignant scary and somehow beautiful read it you wo n't be disappointed then read his new one lisey 's story which is in more than one way a kind of mirror piece '' when compared to bag of bones by the way i actually think i read once that king himself believes bag of bones to be his best if so he and i agree
king did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one there were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing for the most part not bad would make a good movie
not to take anything away from my favorite author but i thought the book was way too long the story was suspenseful and descriptive but i found myself getting lost in the superfluous background and this is someone who has read the stand at least six times so it 's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline stephen king fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as the cell which i thought was great
it 's amazing how fast king drew me into this story then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two and after that i just read on like a man possessed a few bits feel plotted but i do n't care king 's novels have never been about their plots that 's news to hollywood i think but not to you and me king does n't write short books you can devour in a single sitting or two nah you spend a week with one of these babies savoring every moment he 's fully capable of being a sick bastard do n't you doubt that but he 's equally capable of messing with you on far more disturbing levels i bought a big pile of king novels at the xinhua bookstore on yan an lu which probably means the author got his royalties yes i do live in china i assumed i 'd quit reading at least some of them after the first 10 but pleasant surprise here i 've read every single one from cover to cover and enjoyed them all i 'm so happy about that i 've dwelled upon them after my reading and reviewing was done and while i ca n't be certain because my kings are in a box instead of on a bookshelf right now i have no bookshelf i think this is the last one egad ! just so my subscribers know all three of you haha ! the protagonist is an author named michael and his wife dies suddenly in first paragraph does that give king special access to what i fear the most nah it actually makes me giggle at the coincidence no matter king writes so well that i forget to giggle so well that can only say wow '' and forget my jealousy it 's enough that i can read his books i do n't have to write them hey writing is hard reading if the author does his job is easy king does his job oh yes he does
it may seem for king to make his protagonist a writer of romantic suspense king sounded a bit defensive on the promotional tape his publisher sent reviewers wambaugh was a cop and he writes about cops king says you have to write about what you know he goes on just like he writes about maine there are many themes and mysteries in this book some of my favorites are the ideas concerned with recreational reading king and his editor both suggest that this book owes a lot to daphne du maurier 's rebecca so not surprisingly it is a ghost story with some fictional monsters like vampires or zombies or what ever our suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy the story may involve considerable effort but ghosts for anyone who has ever experienced the loss of a loved one it is almost impossible not to believe in ghosts an interesting fact that king 's character encounters constantly is that women in this country read more than men men characters in the book when they meet the author always say something like you are my wife 's favorite writer '' another story that is referred to frequently is mars is heaven '' by ray bradbury i love this story even more so because it is part of a cycle of stories which bradbury wrote known as the martian chronicles i am a bit concerned about king 's use of the story here because he summarizes it a bit abruptly and it is a tale which relies on a surprise ending so it would benefit readers to find a copy of the martian chronicles and read that first before reading bag of bones i believe mars is heaven '' is the original title and the title that was used in several anthologies many years ago it would be hard for readers to find it with that title now however as i think it was published as the third expedition '' in the martian chronicles bag of bones simply summarized involves a popular writer who 's wife dies unexpectedly soon he finds himself griped with a paralyzing writer 's block he flounders through his life in the course of tying to put things back together and finally visits their summer house in a tiny village which he has avoided since his wife 's death because of the feeling that it was mainly her place it is here that he begins to encounter various spirits not to mention a young widow and her three year old shirley daughter he soon becomes romantically involved with the widow as he tries to protect them from a rich and evil step father he begins to unravel secrets that his dead wife has kept from him which mysteriously involve the history of their summer house and the surrounding community king conjures enormous suspense and finally resolves the plot with some rather violent incidents and horrible revelations i know everyone will be annoyed by my nitpicking but one bag of bones in the plot is dissolved '' almost instantaneously with a strong solution of lye i just have to point out that lye is n't very suitable for dissolving bones as it is an alkaline a strong acid would have worked better quicker king mentions in his promotional tape that he does n't like doing research but someone should have been able to point this out as i 've mentioned one of the interesting things about this book is the thoughts about recreational reading toward the end king 's character deplores violence even fictional violence like the killings which are frequently the basis of murder mysteries and by extension part of the violent conclusion of this book i enjoy analysis of mysteries and detective stories and i have always wondered why exactly murders seem to be a necessary part of a large group of entertaining memorable stories i share a bit of the uneasiness that king expresses here overall i think fictional violence is part of a mechanism that writers use to stress the characters they create
four years back a friend introduced me to dean koontz i fell in love and started buying his books koontz was a name i never knew but stephen king was a name i grew up on i was hooked on koontz and realized i wanted to give the same chance to king someone in a similar genre whose name i recognized i have since discovered that king continually has something that koontz does not always have koontz is a master of keeping one in suspence sure but king is a master of words he can make something sad horrific painful seem appealing he writes just beautifully and is a rare writer who evokes a sort of external emotion i ca n't give the book a 5 it could have been probably 50 pages shorter and had the same affect but i want to give it a it is just that good i teared up i was shocked i laughed all together when i read this book it is not so much a thrasher novel as one might be used to seeing from king as it is a love story which continues after one of the party dies with some severe dedication mixed inbetween please go read this book i ca n't wait to read it a second time
bag of bones presents a sans the typical gore of stephen king i am a fan of king and have read many of his books simply for the intrigue they bestow onto me however bag of bones breaks free of the typical king paradigm and soars to new heights mike noonan a mildly successful author experiences great tragedy when his beloved wife joanna dies suddenly from a brain aneurysm when he travels to their summer home entitled sara laughs to properly grieve his late wife he encounters a poor young widow whose daughter is greedily coveted by her wealthy grandfather noonan is instantly immersed in a struggle between an old billionaire and his daughter in law 's child while doing all that he can for his widow friend mike unravels another mystery in sara laughs he discovers another presence is in the house with him and refuses to leave until mike learns what the presence wants him to learn at first he thinks the ghost is that of his wife joanna but the more powerful the presence becomes the more mike is forced to question its true identity and his own safety
this book surprised me in that i enjoyed it so much i mean i have always loved king 's work but this one resolidified me as a fan and more proof that king knows exactly what he 's doing when he writes the book surrounds mike noonan a writer who 's young wife dies suddenly after four years of writer 's block and never being able to move on noonan goes to stay at their summer cabin sara laughs in a small you guessed it maine town what follows is a story about lost loves new friendships and love haunted houses and a secret that the town has had hidden for over 100 years for some it might be long 732 pages but i found its pace to be so good you end up reading it into the wee hours of the night this is one of those books i just could n't put down because i wanted to know the solution to the mysteries definetly read this book in a way it 's so unlike king 's normal ventures because it has a whodunit feel that is not common to his novels
and even if you know nothing about baseball like me kearns goodwin has hit a home run with wait till next year '' you will learn all about the rivalry between the mets and the yankees and the history of goodwin 's beloved brooklyn dodgers she tells all about her heroes jackie robinson gil hodges and roy campanella all of these great baseball nuggets are woven into her story of growing up in brooklyn in the and is so evocative of a time and place that was quintessentially american this book will make you long for a town like rockville centre sometime between 1949 and 1957
i too grew up on long island in the and early two years in queens and ten years out on duh oyland '' i 'm a few years younger the dodgers were already in hollywood and i rooted for the hated jankees but the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood from soothing sound of red barber 's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of rockville centre read periodically in lieu of a sunday sermon mostly asking for more money i have only occasionally returned to long island since we moved away when i was 14 and like everywhere else it is just not the same goodwin 's experiences are just about as close as i have ever come to going back home for those of our generation who grew up in parts of the country other than long island i believe at least i hope that these recollections can return you to that wonderful time the way they did for me
doris kearns goodwin seems to have written a book about her growing up in the ny suburbs for her own pleasure of simply remembering the simpler '' days before free agency adulthood and the pressures that come to all of us as we move along in years her storytelling is at times pure magic when it was the dodgers of brooklyn the yankees of the bronx and the giants of manhattan and the polo grounds the hope of a baseball fan shows beautifully and reminds us all that we need n't lose all of our childish passion simply because the years pass one is reminded of the past couple of years with the red sox ending the curse '' and the white sox winning in style in the south side of chicago it leaves cubs nation truly understanding this concept next year while the book is clearly a pleasant read one can not help but wonder if any author by goodwin would have gotten this published that does n't mean it should not have been rather she had the ability through her name as a writer of history to make this book happen a wonderful summer read
just this book wonderful story about growing up in the sweetness of the 1950 's but also about overcoming childhood loss to become a very successful person author wife and mother
doris kearns goodwin took a break from national history to get personal in this 1997 memoir of her experiences growing up a long island girl in the and rooting for the brooklyn dodgers like bob and ray used to say her loss is your gain i admit approaching this book with some trepidation clearly the book was inspired by goodwin 's participation as one of many talking pinheads on ken burns ' 1994 tv documentary baseball '' on that show where various hoi pollois traded their mortarboards for yankee caps and extolled the wagnerian ideal of a whitey ford fastball goodwin was a frequent annoying presence obviously trotted in to water down the testosterone as if george will was n't enough to accomplish that and for the first hundred pages of this book i felt justified in my prejudices as goodwin fills her pages with pat descriptions of suburban life loosely connected to a baseball team she writes about her enthusiasm for without any evident enthusiasm but once the book got going my opinion changed that happened when little catholic doris enters a confessional before her first holy communion with wholesome piety she tells the priest her darkest most sinful secret a wish that yankee pitcher allie reynolds would break his arm that 's not all i wished that enos slaughter of the cards would break his ankle that phil rizzuto of the yanks would fracture a rib and that alvin dark of the giants would hurt his knee '' the priest is put out not at her fantasies of carnage but because he 's a dodgers fan too i believe they will win the world series someday fairly and squarely '' he tells her you do n't need to wish harm on others to make it happen '' but it 's easy to imagine doris thinking otherwise especially after bobby thomson slams a ralph branca fastball along with the dodgers ' hopes for making the series in 1951. as goodwin writes about that and later seasons her account takes on a riveting poignancy that reminds one why goodwin 's books are so celebrated in the first place not for her originality as a historian but for her synthesizing skill as a writer she even gets the chance to see her heroes close up and unlike the baseball stars of today they do n't disappoint gil hodges accepts her gift of a christopher medal to help him out of a batting slump with gentle affection jackie robinson signs her autograph book with a bit of wisdom keep your smile a long long while '' no the book 's not perfect it starts slow and her attempts to tie her childhood in with big stories of the day like the hearings and the integration standoff in little rock feel like strained politically correct cocktail chatter rather than a real accounting of a young life amid confusing times but most of the way through you get a really sweet and sharp picture of what it was like to care about baseball when it was worth caring about goodwin has a gift for making history live again in the pages of her books and like ebbets field presents her readers here with a real diamond in the rough
i love doris kearns goodwin 's work and this book is no exception it 's very different from her other books but very enjoyable it brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers very short in comparison to her other books but worth the time and the money i have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong but i am not a baseball historian so this did n't bother me in the least bit
it 's been a while for me since i read this one but one impression clearly stuck happy bright childhood in the 1950 's and yes baseball it was overall well written memoir very optimistic full of childhood memories of a neighborhoodly and cozy streets and people i think that besides being a well written woman 's memoir a baseball fan should find the book to be a treat as well
in 1949 when doris kearns was six and living in rockville center ny her father taught her how to chart and score a baseball game the primary radio entertainment of her community in these years it was baseball that unified the local community though whether one was loyal to the brooklyn dodgers as kearns was the ny yankees or the ny giants was a different matter for kearns goodwin the youngest in the family it was baseball which served as her ritual connection to her father since she sat with him after dinner each night and related the scoring of that day 's game it is to these baseball narratives that she attributes her early interest in data collection and in since she discovered her father stayed interested when she could keep him in suspense traits which she believes helped make her the historian she has become as she describes her life during 1949 1956 when either the dodgers or the giants played in the world series usually against the ny yankees she connects her life at home and in the community with her fierce love of the dodgers and especially her hero jackie robinson showing how team loyalties were related to the social structure of her town kearns goodwin characterizes the friendly rivalries within the community becoming the official window '' scorekeeper one summer for the local butcher shop in which the two butchers giants fans kept the neighbors up to date re the giants record kearns goodwin ragmop '' then eight was the official '' scorekeeper for the dodgers the high point of her baseball '' was the dodgers win over the yankees in 1955 for the world series championship when she was twelve throughout this remarkable memoir kearns goodwin connects her family life to baseball her father 's sad life before his marriage in which he was orphaned at a young age his love for her mother always ill as a result of childhood rheumatic fever her devotion to her older sisters and her interest in family history are all connected in her mind and in this memoir with baseball her trips to ebbets field where she sought autographs her adolescence in which her interest in baseball competed with her interest in boys and the importance of baseball in her life following the death of her mother attest to the cultural allure of the pastime '' capturing a moment of social history kearns goodwin puts the early fifties into perspective and shows the lasting importance of baseball on her professional and personal development a remarkable memoir by one of the great baseball fans n mary whipple
i finished reading '' wait till next year '' last evening and i would like anyone who enjoys memoirs or simply appreciates beautiful writing to run out and grab goodwin 's charming book a recollection of the life she led in long island and the journey she made with the brooklyn dodgers it is not just about baseball it 's about growing up in the late forties and fifties about family life a coming of age story for doris and dem bums '' past summer was the anniversery of the dodgers first world championship in 1955 and it seemed an appropriate time to read goodwin 's memoir and i 'm so very happy i did
i 've this book several times now lani diane rich is a master of romantic comedy and the offbeat heroine for those of us who are tired of reading female heroines wanda 's a breath of fresh air slightly tinged with the scent of scotch it 's hard for me to believe that other reviewers here never let go with a word when things are n't going well and the author 's willingness to go there with her character gives wanda the feel of the real '' any woman with a pulse and a closet jimmy stewart fan will fall in love with walter and his quirky smile his protectiveness and his obvious love for an imperfect woman the secondary characters are excellent the story draws you in and before you know it you 're reading it again great book i truly enjoyed it lani diane rich you do n't write fast enough SMILE
or any book written in the first person but i did enjoy this book the heroine was flawed which i liked but the hero was a saint which i did n't quite believe oh do n't get me wrong walter is a man any woman would want but the big question is why did he want wanda even so i thought the book was better than average
i met this author at the romance writers of american national conference in reno where i learned she had been nominated for a rita think oscars '' for women 's fiction for best first book she was such a delight that i had already decided to buy the before she won the award i was certainly not disappointed i like characters with a lot of hubris and i especially enjoy female protagonists who do not require a prince charming to fix '' their lives even if they meet him fun secondary characters bones is great ! too terrific highly recommend this book
a friend referred me to this new author and i truly owe her one lani diane rich made me laugh and cry and also kept me entertained for the entire story at a time in my life when reading something '' is a luxury at best this book provided a wonderful escape i ca n't wait to get the next two books and hope she continues writing for all of us that are now hooked on her characters thanks for a great read
lani diane rich made a booming debut with time off for good behavior i originally read the book when it first came out and recently the novel it was even better the second time around among legions of cookie cutter chick lit authors rich stands out with her snappy humourous dialogue and delightfully flawed characters if you 're a lover of chick lit or you just enjoy witty conversation and authors who hold nothing back you 'll love time off for good behavior
this was a really entertaining story my only complaint is that i was able to finish it in a few hours the dialogue is natural and funny and wanda is lovable in spite of her obvious flaws i ca n't wait for rich 's next effort
hard to resist impossible to put down it was terrific from the get go i found wanda to be a very likeable character and no more litigious than the next person who was blown up in a gas leak and left in a coma from the cross examination of a pencil faced '' lawyer i was rooting for her it 's hilarious like when wanda looks like a matchstick after a haircut and the storyline is fresh for me the story went from enjoyable to must recommend to others '' when wanda discovers the music mystery everything this author came up with all the details mentioned are incorporated into the storyline not just thrown in it makes for a very satisfying ending there 's no surprising last minute silly coincidences just to wrap up the story my only complaint is that it was over too soon i 'm anxious to read the next book from this author !
one must read this book this book is a great experience of every reader who can go throughly
this book is a parody a satire written by a very knowlegebale author it is about a young jewish immigrant vladamir who has lived in the usa for 15 years and at the opening of the novel is 25 years is having trouble adapting to life in america he is a paasive non initiated person in the american way of hold a bureaucratic job he paints a parody of the usa and is a satire with much humor about the nineties to be successful he decides he needs power money sex appeal and an american woman to get these things he undertakes marginal even criminal activites his adventures are humerous he fails a link to the russian mafia causes him to escape to a fictitious eastern block country and to the city of prava probably prague there again his aggressive not though activities put him in danger with the local mafia and eventually he returns to america in europe he is still after the same inner needs for success that he longs for in the usa over 5 years he somewhat matures and integrates more his american and russian identities though he still feels a person living in two worlds the life of many first generation immigrants his adventures are erotic aggressive funny rediculous and sometimes criminal the author has a very thorough knowledge of russian culture and literature which he refers to in the text often in a very funny way the prose is long and drawn out and not always easy to book is very you want a look at the modern world through the eyes of a jeweis russian immigrant the book is worthwhile
vladmir girshkin is an unlikeable schemer who spends most of the story fleeing those whom he has defrauded or angered he deals with a series of bizarre girlfriends and an even less likeable mother eventually moving from new york to the fictional satellite republic of stolavia vladmir ascends to a but powerful role within russian organized crime the detailed side characters range from charmingly offbeat to intensely annoying shteyngart hilariously mocks the vapid trendiness and vain sophistry of overeducated underworked american postgraduates in europe he also explores issues of national and personal identity as vladmir moves back and forth from america to europe i 'm definitely interested in reading more from this author
the characterization of vladimir girshkin is excellent from how he looks and dresses which morphs through the book to how he thinks about himself his family his ethniticity to how he perceives the other russians and americans around him many humoristic moments as vladimir in an effort to get himself out of a life gets in with deeper and crazier schemes to extract money and respect from different criminal elements all the while building or rebuilding the ego inside the man the characterization as a trip of is very well written but i did find myself forcing to finish i did end up caring about the characters esp vladimir and morgan in the end so i pushed on wanting to see what happened to them but the plot bogged down taking turns that made the humourously ludicrous ones in the beginning of the story seem normal you have to suspend your reality checks for a novel like this but it just got harder to do toward the end the clever literary references and play on words at the later half of the novel did n't make me chuckle or think as much as the ones in the beginning i will read shtenyngart 's next novel with anticipation writing any novel is hard work and i 'm glad gary pressed on with number 2
this was an excellent book that defies description it 's unpredictable constantly changing focus and rhythym it 's funny and observant and really feels like an insightful work of fiction i had never heard of this book before until i saw a new york times article listing famous literary places in new york '' and included this book since it was listed with other greats among them henry james scott fitzgerald etc i ordered it on amazon i was n't disappointed but it does n't rise to that level my biggest and some of my only problems with the book include both unnecessary fictionalization fake european countries cities languages cultures that are thinly veiled czech russian circle one and some pretty implausible characters other than that very readable and very entertaining book
the title of this book is a misnomer there 's no russian debutante in the book unless you count vladimir girshkin who came to the from leningrad as a young boy
i am saddened by the utterly unfair and inappropriate posting here by one reader she had not read the book but because i am a mere moderate feminist rather than a radical one she chooses to excoriate me here a far more unbiased source usa today 's review of my book said from finding the job to customizing it this book is full of smart advice '' in the reader 's choice poll it was rated the 1 most useful career guide here on amazon you can read sample material from the book i encourage you to do that before making your decision
very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor in the first story he explains his job as an elf at santaland and describes his daily life it is so funny some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time do n't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside but if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time then by all means buy this book
if you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you he may push it sometimes but is n't that what a good writer should do knowing he is half greek so am i i was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard unfortunately there was n't one santaland was my favorite
david sedaris was only famous for talking about christmas santaland diaries heard on npr stations across the country is what gave him his first fame this collection of stories came after his first book barrel fever and before the rest this is back when he was still writing short stories which he is n't really known for anymore this book has a couple of short stories and like the short stories in barrel fever they 're not really accessible to a wider audience they 're dark baby murder dark definitely not something everyone can appreciate but pick it up maybe you 'll like it if you 're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children 's holiday pageants bitterly it 's worth a try
if you are looking for the literary equivalent of it 's a wonderful life '' book is definitely not for you however if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by david sedaris from jim timothy the extortionist who preys upon a pentecostal church to dinah the christmas '' sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you though you know clarence the angel would disapprove if you 've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats curl up with this offering and you 'll find a kindred spirit in david sedaris
i was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if i was ok '' i was uncontrollably laughing even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds i was embarrassing myself again
david sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive all of his books make me laugh out loud embarrass myself in public places when i bring his books along this one did not disappoint funny holidays tales that make the season brighter or even out of give you a healthy hearty laugh i adore this man
truly the author 's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas parents children evangelical christians from kentucky television macy 's the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war and keeping up with the joneses '' this short book is much funnier than his me talk pretty some day '' as the author 's humorous cynicism is at its best one ca n't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the american psyche three of the stories appear to be autobiographical with obvious changes made to protect the innocent '' wherein the author tells '' the others in the guise of another regardless sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches even if there 's a little guilt attached to that feeling
the great dallas theological seminary professor hendricks shares with others his basic principles for passing on to his students the knowledge and passion for god 's word basically the book can be boiled down to one primary principle you must have passion for what you know to transfer what you know to others the book was originally released as the seven laws of the teacher but has since been repackaged and under this new title with a new cover and design but the truths shared by hendricks are timeless and powerful and should be read by every teacher ! the first law of the teacher was the best in my opinion if you ever stop growing today you stop teaching tomorrow hendricks challenges the teacher to remain a student to always continue learning pursuing truth and knowledge and to pass that thirst on to their students far more important than any particular lesson or tidbit of information is the thirst for knowledge and truth and that is something that is modeled for students in the lives of the teacher if the teacher is stale the lessons and information ca n't be fresh ! the seven laws of the teacher are as follows the law of the teacher if you stop growing today you stop teaching tomorrow the law of education the way people learn determines how you teach the law of activity maximum learning is always the result of maximum involvement the law of communication to truly impart information requires the building of bridges the law of the heart teaching that impacts is not head to head but heart to heart the law of encouragement teaching tends to be most effective when the learner is properly motivated the law of readiness the process will be most effective when both student and teacher are adequately prepared
this is the best book on teaching out there every teacher must read this book and not just once but every year it is very practical and easy to read hendricks defines teaching as causing people to learn '' 87 the teacher is not somebody who covers material but enables students to change thus the definition of learning is change '' this book is highly recomended
this is an easy read and great instruction manual i 've only read the first 2 chapters and i 'm excited about reading the rest i hope to become a teacher who chages lives
communication and caring compassion is the key to teaching hendricks uses the acronym teacher '' to relate his concepts the examples of interaction shared in his book illustrate the importance of communication and show of care that motivates students to learn he states the greatest teachers are not necessarily the people up front with high visibility they are the people who have great heart they communicate as a total person and they communicate to the total person of their hearers 87 '' another way to be a person of impact '' is to be vulnerable '' with one 's students not only are communication and compassion important but preparation hendricks relates teaching involves a delicate balance between facts and form between content and communication between what you teach and how you teach it 77 '' if teachers want to prepare their students to think learn and work '' then four skills need to be taught reading writing listening and speaking '' 48 though this book is written for sunday school teachers it contains helpful suggestions for use in other teaching venues for instance hendricks suggests a '' in which teachers ask three questions what are my strengths what are my weaknesses and what do i have to change '' 35 great teachers are the ones who continue to grow in their own personal learning hendricks ' book is a good reminder for all teachers of the main purpose for bible teaching even if the teacher teaches in a secular institution the basic principles of the book can be utilized for instance students will be more willing to try harder and put more effort into their school work if they know the teacher truly cares for them
this book is an excellent resource for church education staff this book covers some basic principles or laws as he calls them regarding teaching in the church environment the law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment this is so true and often followed in higher education but perhaps not very well followed in church education the sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning but according to henricks a student must study must come to class on time and must be interested in the material to proactively learn there is much more good stuff in this book grab it its a great read
when it comes to impact howard hendricks is a master teacher following these proven principles helped my college classes become full these principles work in formal classes at any level and in informal instruction parents will become more effective in their parenting this is a small easily read book that will produce big dividends
glassman 's first law of phillip fisher financial investing is become a partner in a good business for a long time '' get information about the companies your are buying and ignore price trends keep the stocks for the long run at least 5 years believe that assets are linked to time because time is the single most important factor in investing look for companies that 1. have a consistent track record of increasing earnings of at least 7 percent for the last ten years 2. have a good prospect of surviving over the next 50 years 3. do n't have huge capital demands for the profits ideally this means the company is rich it has a service or product that produces a growth rate in earnings over a ten years because ten years suggests reasonable market dominance and invest in companies that will offer value in the future what are people looking today that will meet these criteria biotech robotics fuel cells and alternate energy however most of these companies are emerging technologies which would not qualify them from investment opportunity short term large companies like genetech would qualify whereas small companies like irobot would not because it does not have a ten year track record glassman conservative warren buffet like approach demands forces the investor too follow the maximum do not invest too lose money '' furthermore glassmans conservative view attacks speculation and favors graham security investment strategies of predictability glassman surprisingly does not predict doom for the speculators instead says history shows that the fate of the stock market is closely connected to the fate of the economy '' a speculator would own hugh about of stock or commodities in a few sectors whereas a security investor would diversify into a portfolio of many stocks well why not just invest into a index or the whole market per recommendation by john bogle the index returns about 7 percent and does not require buying and selling commissions it is obvious that glassman has some speculation visions as a part of his core beliefs and hopes for above market average profits glassman attempts to justify his risk based beliefs by saying when you hold a stock long enough it becomes less risky than a bond '' the assumption is the investor will select a stock that will not have wide fluctations large downward trends and cause the investor too sell because of pain and having faith the stock market will outperform bonds he makes the prediction that stocks will be higher priced over time glassman has not decided against risk stating prudent behavior is a key to investing '' volatility can an investors best friend because it offers good stocks at bargin prices '' and risk is a necessary evil in the stock market '' this is the language of a speculator do n't trade stocks buy low and sell high is impossible for an investor to turn a profit short term investing is a losing game reeling in the suckers by the thousands the only way to make money short term is to own the market and have the financial power to manipulate it so the best investment advice for an average investor with less than a billion dollars is too dollar cost average in other words invest money consistently over a large period of time and let the average work for ones benefit one good idea is too use a low cost broker such as sharebuilder and setup an investment plan of 10 a pay period diverting into a purchase plan which cost about 4 per transaction pay no attention too the fed this is illogical if the stock market is affected by the economy than if the fed monetary policies cause inflation or deflation the stock market valuations will also change glassman must be assuming that investors do not borrow money to make their stock purchases interest rates slow down or heat up the economy high interest rates slow down company earnings if they are heavy in debt glassman investments do not carry heavy debt loads and operate cash rich and this justifies ignoring high interest rates however it does not explain the interconnected web of commerce where companies are constantly adjusting their inventories either too cut costs or replenish depleted inventories depending on economic factors glassman 's faith is that the fed will do a descent job in maintain the valuation of the dollar which means controlling inflation adjusting interest rates and maintain dollar hegemony against the euro and yen the second assumption is that the stock market will continue to climb onward and upward eventually crossing
this is the best book written by stephen king ! i 've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before i die
i 'm reviewing this as an afterthought of its genre the stand '' is without question the best and the story is in my opinion the greatest stephen king has done i 've read the other reviews and i wo n't go into specifics however if you enjoy reading end of it all types of stories you will love this book another reviewer complained about it being lengthy well you do n't have to read it to realize that but the story and characters are original and well developed the plot progresses smoothly to an exciting climax with lots of incredible things happening throughout and i 've read it three times
well i got screamed at by my mom for reading this found out it was longer than the bible and got really fired up saying i shouldve read the the plot is doomsday plague is released killing near left either gave visions from this old chick or a like the ultimate showdown between evil and good thats what you are led to belive in 1800 plus pages of agonizingly meticulous the end comes and it really personaly think he had a deadline to meet or something and cut the book hard to put down but its got its faults
before reading 'the stand ' i 'd only read a few novellas and the full length novel 'gerald 's game ' by stephen king and was not all that impressed however after seeing the movie 'the stand ' a few years ago and loving it i decided to read the book that has been proclaimed by readers to be one of his best and now i see why king has so many devotees i must admit that the length of the book was a bit off putting for me in the beginning i have never read a book quite as long as this one but i have found that most books that i 've read that were on the lengthy side tended to be a bit slow and tedious this was not at all the case with 'the stand ' i practically flew through the novel not wanting to put it down ! stephen king 's tale of the end of the world is an engrossing one that deals with the conflict between good and evil as well as real human issues also the character development in this novel is superb one would tend to think that in a novel that deals with so many issues such as a '' that kills 99 of population coping with the loss of loved ones fighting for survival in a world with no rules vivid nightmares of an ominous dark man '' an exhausting cross country trek a pending fight between good and evil and trying to recreate civilization that there would be no room left for the characters to be fully developed but somehow king made it work i did agree with some of the reviewers who said that the ending was a bit but the rest of the book was so well done that i do believe it still deserves every bit of the five stars i am giving it i may be a little late jumping on this bandwagon but i will now certainly be sure to pick up some of king 's earlier works such as the shining and it in hopes that he will continue to live up to the hype !
seriously king 's always an incredible crafstman his characters to die for but of all of his novels i 've read most this stands out as his classic great later novels just feel different even if the voice and writing is always spectacular the stand is less polished but more engaging on a number of fronts vivid memorable scenes i still remember fran biting her tongue on the beach of all things characters are always real and that 's amazing in a fantasy epic normally i look to escapism and fun in fantasy but here the characters feel so alive and real my one thumbs down and it 's not enough to bring this down to four stars is the expanded edition was not necessary the original was expanded enough and just right the new opening does n't engage me like the old one with stu in the garage which is a real holy crap '' sort of opening i once read where king griped about his fans saying his best '' book was such an old classic but hey classic is classic this is a triumph the only weak point to me was the ending it felt rushed maybe not as vivid as the rest but it was all good anyway i recommend this to anyone who is n't susceptible to nightmares it 's more disturbing than scary mind you
this is one of danielle steel 's best books it is about cooper winslow a fading movie actor and lady 's man who is in financial trouble she develops the character of coop '' well so it is easy to visualize him coop decides to rent out his cottage '' guest wings for a month to two different tenants the story centers around his new tenants their romances activities and children in the end coop learns valuable lessons about sacrifice giving to others and true love a interesting story with a good message
danielle steele is a master artist at slowly piecing a book together such as one of her better novels the cottage this book consists of amazing characters that are split from the lives they once knew and later are puzzled back together for a friendly meeting each main character jimmy mark and coop are so different in their personalities but yet so much alike in their experiences they cry laugh and just simply have fun when they are finally together these three men share many similar situations throughout the novel and in the end they all meet and talk about those certain happenings in each of their lives how woman have left cheated and even passed away but they dealt with it and moved on luckily they all found each other in their differences and similarities to be best friends the capturing way steele writes activates your emotions and slams your of thinking she has a '' touch to her writing and it takes your breathe away i thoroughly enjoyed reading this selection and would reccomend it to anyone ! danielle steele is truly a romantic genius

i am about to get married in a year and as usual i am looking for any way i can to slim down for that perfect wedding dress just a few days ago i was sluggish and depressed after going on jenny craig and failing at it i went on jenny craig at age 16 and was uncannily successful almost 10 years later i decided to try it again but to no avail it just did n't fit my life style anymore and i had a really hard time refraining from cheating and incorporating resturaunt and '' meals to fit my plan do n't get me wrong jenny craig works very well if you stick to it but my life has totally changed since grade back in 1997. i found it hard to eat my packaged food and cook home cooked meals for my fianc ' on this plan i have the best of both worlds my fiance ' who ca n't stand diet '' food can eat these not diet but modified meals with me ! ! ! he has given me raves about every recipe i have cooked thus far from suzanne 's book ! i ca n't get him to keep his hands off the grilled chicken before dinner is ready ! best of all it has not even been a complete week and i am already dropping pounds i have lost atleast 5 or 6 pounds since buying this book last friday when i first flipped through the book and saw recipes like chicken piccata pepper steak with herb butter sauce and vegetables provencal i was like uuummm no ! but then i noticed how easy the instructions were and how easy it would be to shop for the basic ingredients which can be used in most of the other meals too now i feel like a whiz in the kitchen making my own salad dressings and hummus dip ! i am utterly enamored with this way of eating because food combining is a virtually plan that i can follow for the rest of my life and my family can enjoy these meals as well i used to watch of three 's company everyday after school as a child who would have thought that in the future that woman playing the hilarious chrissy snow would be the person to introduce something to me that would change my life this is not some crash diet this is something that will extend well beyond that day thank you suzanne !
when buying a book of this type buy it for the value of the information instead of the person who wrote it suzanne shares a method that worked for her and she does it in a helpful and humorous manner even if you do n't believe in food combining the approach and the recipes are still quite helpful if you 're serious about losing weight and have tired everything else on the market your success with this program will be 100 up to you and your determination to achieve your goals i think it 's worth buying
i lost in 2 weeks this weekend i had custard made with heavy cream she is awesome in 2 more weeks i 'll be under i love you suzanne
i 've been reading about weight management programs for the past 4 years i love reading about the human body and better ways to fuel '' it so i signed up for what i thought to be the best plan on the market weight watchers they have that new whole foods '' plan as someone who eats salads everyday for lunch i thought the plan was tough ! i could n't stick with it i constantly had food cravings i gave up after 3 weeks and never used the rest of my meeting '' tickets what to do next at work my looks great so i asked her what she does we were eating lunch at the macaroni grill and she ordered a huge bowl of wheat pasta with veggies it looked so good and she grabbed a piece of the fresh bread on the table i asked how she could eat that and look so good she said she 's been applying suzanne somer 's weight management strategy i was like really what 's that '' she explained the basic guidelines of food combing it sounded simple enough so i started reading about food combining and the concept made sense the very next day i went to barnes and noble and bought a copy of this particular book she does have other books but i thought this one gave the best explanation of the plan since i 'm a i 've only been on this plan for a couple days but i feel really good no more indigestion no more feeling stuffed i feel great and the best part i do n't get hungry and there are no cravings why because i have n't really cut out anything just rearrange when i eat it combining foods makes sense different foods carbs vs fats need different enzymes in the body to digest them if they are eaten in groups the body can effortlessly digest them and if you 're thinking it 's not a healthy plan because she 's not a doctor you 're wrong since vegetables on this plan can be eaten with both carbs and fats i find myself eating more veggies and fruits than i ever did before even more exciting this is not atkins so you are not eating fat all the time for example a typical dinner could be grill salmon with two fresh veggies as sides i had that last night for dinner and it was delicious you will be getting your carb fix and feel completely satisfied at the same time i 'm a cereal eater and had a bowl with milk a couple minutes ago if you have any doubt do n't i 'm serious the book is only 16 in the store on amazon probably less if you just follow the general guidelines you 'll lose weight yes this plan may be similar '' to other plans but she has streamlined it so you feel comfortable with your body and the idea of losing weight i guess it 's all about presentation i 'm actually excited about this plan i honestly feel like my search is over
the problem with biographies of marlon brando and celebrities in general is that they are often written by an outsider someone who had little or no personal acquaintance with the subject and is sometimes just out to cash in on their celebrity it is these problems with most biographies that makes george englund 's biography of marlon brando such a joy to read englund 's friendhip with brando started in 1956 and his biography therefore thrusts us directly into the height of his fame and spares us the date and details of his birth and upbringing these often constitute the more tedious parts of other biographies another common problem with biographies is that they have a tendency to simply list off the actions and professional achievements of their subjects sometimes giving them the appearance of a prolonged this is another area where englund 's book comes into its own his close relationship with brando allows him to recount many very personal and revealing tales that allow the reader to feel a closeness to marlon that is difficult considering how private a man he was the difficulties of brando 's life are well documented but the accounts offered here are far more vivid and moving the writer is not with sensationalism or scandal merely the real story and the emotion felt 'the way it 's never been done before ' is a fascinating read and is a must have for anyone that is passionate about the work of marlon brando surely the screen 's greatest ever acto
george englund 's memoir of marlon brando is that a memoir and far from a biography it is a touching remembrance filled with genuine affection for its subject but not so much as to make the author blind to the shortcomings and warts of the greatest of all our film actors in its affection it is a welcome departure from some of the more vicious portrayals of brando peter manso 's biography comes to mind at its best englund 's work is distinguished by some really beautiful interludes and gripping passages his description of visiting his own absentee father after decades is especially moving one senses that englund believed he was privy to the whole of brando the insider of all insiders his graphic description of brando 's last night is almost an exercise in trying to prove to himself and us how close he was to brando and it is a rare occurrence of englund going perhaps too far but for all that he was allowed to see it is also apparent to the reader if not to englund himself that georgie was kept at arms length from various facets and compartments of his famous subject there are dramatic and notable gaps in the book and one gets the feeling that englund 's import as a macho and intellectual sidekick grew once wally cox died it is perhaps too much to ask any single book to cover the whole of brando the subject is simply too complex but this is a useful glimpse inside at least some aspects of brando 's life
good book but i have one major reservation in an interview george englund said he penned this account of marlon brando with brando 's dignity in my hand '' so presumptively englund as a best friend would n't think to ever reveal personal information or details that brando would have never wanted known right is n't that what best friends are for um quite the contrary here englund 's telling of brando 's last days were too dam detailed at times vile and completely unnecessary surely this is not what people want to remember of the revered legend i 'm unafraid to say that i wept on the day brando died like i had lost someone i knew and loved for fans who really loved him a good portion of this thing excruciating pain from his disease and lying in helpless condition on a you will find incredibly depressing i 'd recommend skipping some parts if you wan na keep the image of brando the almighty one intact dark clouds away this was indeed a pure delight to pore through when is the subject ever boring afterall i was happy released this very personal tale of his friendship with brando i only wish the actor himself were still alive to admire even more
this is a sad and poignant memoir and a fine companion piece to brando 's autobiography i wondered while reading it why englund was n't mentioned by name in the autobiography but that is made clear toward the end of englund 's work a few comments regarding the handful of negative reviews on this site brando 's legacy as a great actor is not diminished in any way by some of the brutal revelations regarding his personal life perhaps a few sordid details could have been left out but i never got the sense that they were thrown in out of a sense of animus directed at brando in fact what comes through repeatedly is the author 's deep affection for his subject a mutual bond that was forged through their shared misfortune at having and destructive fathers to their credit they achieved great material and artistic success in spite of the psychological burdens they both stuggled with throughout their lives now as for the book itself there is one chapter dealing with englund 's relation to his father that is absolutely riveting not only did i find it so but brando himself was absorbed in this story seeing as it touched on the same issues at the core of his own personality there are also numerous other anecdotes that shed light on the main question who is marlon brando what is he really like when the veil of his movie star personna is lifted in many respects it 's a sad picture it 's the classic case of the mistreated child who grows up to perpetuate the wrongs that were once unfairly inflicted on him as for his acting he was able to overcome all obstacles and develop his great talent though there 's no doubt that the fuel that fired him was drawn from the well of his bitter early years
i believe that englund has set a new standard on how biographies should be written he showed us a side of marlon that should be included in every biography and so rarely also applaud englund 's passion as a true friend in this wonderful book he has shown what a real friend is which is something that most of us can only aspire to
george englund 's book is the product of 50 years of a friendship with marlon brando the lives of two men and their families intertwined loving and suffering through the best and worst times his book portrays the pain and grief of loss the exultation of success and the of fame and reality george 's book goes beyond the commonplace biography and digs down deep i recommend reading it
this book comes straight from the heart as son of author george englund i george englund am closer my dad than anyone else i grew up with marlon and his children christian miko and cheyenne i spent time with them all in tahiti on his atoll and worked with marlon on several projects directly and extensively before giving my review on the book i must comment on the publisher 's weakley review which misses the mark almost completely this book was intentionally is in no way an attempt to document brando 's career or establish his place in film history that is another book which i truly hope my father writes and one for which he is eminently qualified ge was arguably marlon 's closest lifelong friend and this book is his truth about their relationship and his deepest most honest perception of who marlon was it was finished in an insanely compressed schedule after marlon 's death requiring the author to balance the bereavement of a lost best friend with the pressure of writing a serious comprehensive book with an extremely limited deadline contrary to the publishers weekly author i found that englund 's take was consistently centered and reflected the reality of their experiences they are both spectacularly talented in different and similar ways the reviewer mentioned that ge career was never fully developed is an ignorant statement it was the opposite of an ego trip the publishers weekly review claimed that the narration ruled out any insight but their shared experiences illustrate a deep and complex picture of two highly unique guys sharing a rare set of experiences brando was accurately revealed in this book and englund appropriately represented his role and stature imagine if you had to write a book about your best friend the greatest actor in the world within 30 days of his death i 'm a hard grader on my dad but i think he kicked ass on this one big time it is honest fair and balanced
ark angel '' is my first go at an alex rider novel even without reading the five preceding books i enjoyed this one for what it is a spy novel for young adults horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up there is virtually no character development or exploration there are constant plot twists and turns whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader if the reader is looking for a character to identify with to journey with to aspire to alex is a bit thin if the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down this could be a good vein to mine ark angel '' reminds me of the theatrical mission impossible '' films action driven violent uncomplicated three days of the condor '' or manchurian candidate '' it is n't while horowitz is n't among the top tier of young adult fiction writers rowling robert cormier lloyd alexander gary paulsen laurie williams come to mind but there are many more but he 's a competent craftsman who has extended ian fleming 's 007 to a younger contemporary audience i imagine that fans of horowitz might eventually graduate to richer material
other than stormbreaker this may be the next best alex rider adventure yet in some ways the plot is predictable as all alex rider stories are except for the ending surprise in scorpia the action is fast paced and is perfect for a teenage boy reader girls who enjoy spy stories will like it too it is hard to put the book down
this is the same classic alex rider adventure one of the better ones in the series but scorpia is still the best
alex rider is by far the thriftiest boy i know ! horowitz is a great writer and can make the best descriptions ! i enjoy reading his books very much
in this thrilling addition to the alex rider series alex is in the hospital recovering from a near shave with a sniper bullet courtesy of scorpia while in the hospital he befriends the friendless paul drevin the son of a one night as alex was walking down the hallway he saw the receptionist shot and heard that the shooters were after tricks the kidnappers into thinking he 's paul and then leads them through the hotel zapping one of them in the neck with defibullators knocks another one out with a medicine ball and tricks a man with a solid metal watch into walking into a room with an incredibly powerful magnet that was n't pretty but he fergot about the fourth guy he 's captured and brought back to the headquarters of the kidnappers who are actually the members of a terrorist oraganization force three and so it goes with a brilliant escape from a burning building a awsome race a meeting with the cia a private island a huge space hotel rigged to come hurtliing down to our very own washinton the alex rider series gets better with every new installment and i ca n't wait for another one to come out it 's hands down the best spy series around i would recommend this book to every one who can read or be read to
i have read all the books of this series this is really good i mean i didnt like the ending much but besides that anthony horowitz is a great author
i assigned this text almost unseen as a course book because it included so many of the classic essays which one might have ended up xeroxing the students found the book very useful i would have liked a more historical focus but that 's because of my own training i will assign the book again

there is much to enjoy here even if one does not have a special interest in architecture as a lifelong chicagoan i especially liked the photo of stanislaus kostka church 79 which occurs in the formerly polish neighborhood that i grew up in i also enjoyed the old maps of the chicago area from the 1600 's
in lost chicago historian david lowe explores the architectural and cultural history of america 's great heartland '' city this is a community who architectural heritage was all to often squandered during the last five decades of its growth and evolution lowe 's elegant and informative text is wonderfully enhanced with more than 270 rare period photos and prints many of them published here for the first time lost chicago is a celebration of the age of gustavus swift and philip armour and the greatest stockyards in the world when cyrus mccormick potter palmer george pullman and marshall field were the national barons of business and industry when prairie avenue and state streets rivaled new york 's fifth avenue when architectural giants ranging from louis sullivan to frank lloyd wright were designing buildings of incomparable excellence and innovation lost chicago is a must '' for students of chicago history architecture and personalities
first issued in 1975 this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of chicago 's architecture that has been destroyed by nature and man today chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel and it is i live there ! but after reading this book you wo n't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the urban renewal movement of the and early had never happened if you are interested in architecture chicago history or urban design and planning read this book
i had a little difficulty getting this book but i 'm glad that i did finally find it it is a wonderful mystery even though the subject behind the mystery is disturbing i know that i knew about research done on live animals but i never thought about with dogs somehow i pictured lab rats and mice it goes against everything that i believe in to use our domestic best friends for product testing and experiments but the mystery was good and i enjoyed holly and her friends again conant knows how to write a story while she bravely uncovers some less than desirable facts about big business this is a wonderful series for dog lovers or for any animal lovers if it comes to that
holly winter returns in the book in the dog lover 's mysteries holly writes articles for a dog 's life trains at the local obedience club shows her dog in obedience and works to find the dognappers of her dog and her father 's wolf her malamute rowdy plays a starring role in this book that takes a strong look at testing on animals i was not the same after reading this book i have to admit that after reading it i started looking more closely at the labels on packaging that say not tested on animals '' this was not a preachy book but brought to light some shocking things done to animals at some testing facilities i consider myself an animal lover and was haunted by this book after reading it not exactly a lighthearted read but it was worth it the first book in this series is a new leash on death '' enjoy !
conant constantly amazes me with her ability to weave dog info into mystery anyone who has ever shown a dog had had to deal with a gossipy and few would n't like to take a pair of shears to one of them as well ! i adore this book and highly suggest you get a copy
to read sir charles is to read about life without the pompous filter you get with most other pap this installment is no different from anything else from lord chinaski
with bukowski there is no middle ground you either love him or you hate him yes he can be filthy jaded and downright mean but there is the ring of truth here as well published posthumously this is a feast for bukowski fans there are a lot of dark poems here like walking with the dead and return to sender but there is also some lighthearted stuff in the fool dines out he shows us his human side he is the husband whose rude behavior towards a waiter brings on spousal criticism in private of course he has been accused of being a misogynist in bone palace ballet there is no evidence of that bukowski was a bit of a misanthrope or did he just see the human condition a whole lot clearer than the rest of us a must have for any bukowski fan !
bukowski in his last years rare to see a writer grapple with aging and death in such a matter of fact way there are some true gems in this one bone palace is a little repetitive but you ca n't be shocked to find bukowski holding forth on booze women horses hypocrites and writing what else did he ever write about and really what more can you ask for
all about grilling is a refreshing book of new ideas for outdoor cooking and entertaining i was very impressed with the different combinations of ingredients the presentation of the meal the grilled side dishes and the rubs and sauces i received the book as a gift and have enjoyed using it for my summer entertaining i am now purchasing a book for a friend
catch me if you can '' follows the life of frank abignale one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was this book is the autobiographical account of abignale 's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father 's mobil credit card there are so many times in this book that i had to step back and think about the air of confidence that abignale displayed yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him some of the stories are absolutely outrageous i loved them all ! this book also talks about his time in prison across seas in europe and how terrible he was treated in the french prisons if you liked the movie then you should definately read this book it further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie a must read
this book was very well written and so much fun to read frank abagnale tells his story with the same flare and finesse that he pulled off the cons of his criminal career entertaining from start to finish
we all know of frank abagnale 's personality arrogant yet kind with class among all the different characters that he chooses to play whether he 's a pilot doctor lawyer or a college professor i believe that frank is somewhat confused of who he is frank ran away '' from home at 16 the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school at 16 most people do n't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future one thing was for sure frank wanted money and women i believe frank 's unique personality came from the way he was brought up having endured his parent 's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him it all started with his father frank abagnale during the process of his 's parent 's divorce his father still loved is mother so frank would try to get his son to say things like talk to her son tell her i love her tell her we 'd be happier if we all lived together tell her you 'd be happier if she came home that all you kids would be happier '' his jr 's father led him to the first step of manipulation frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce since his father was quite a rich man he had a whole variety of rich friends and frank would come in contact with his friends quite often this is where frank learned the attitude of the rich '' with confidence finally when frank did his first con with his father 's money frank forgave him look son if you 'll tell us how you did this and why we 'll forget it there 'll be no punishments and i 'll pay the bills '' frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment he did n't believe this to be a huge mistake with confidence manipulation some class and little fear of breaking the law we come to frank abagnale jr
frank abagnale stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time the story is inflated at times in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with still the catch me if you can is engaging and abignale 's scams combine inventiveness and good humor enjoy
if you like me have seen the film with leonardo dicaprio and tom hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book you are reading the right review ! if you were in front of me i would look at you with a grin as if to show that i knew something you did n't and encourage you to do so frank abagnale is less likable in the book which is to be expected but is still far from what we would consider a true villain it caught me by surprise about halfway through how i was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values i suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy overall a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more
i read this book after watching the movie staring tom hanks and leonardo dicaprio before i started i knew i liked the story but i did n't realize how much i loved reading abagnale 's account of his life of crime i enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot a doctor a professor and a lawyer i also liked the novel 's open frankness about the author 's misdeeds however i thought the book was not especially well written abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion i also felt somewhat deprived with the novel 's ending frank abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story i would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right all in all i would recommend this book as an easy weekend read
many people became aware of frank abagnale jr 's story until the movie starring tom hanks and leonardo dicapprio was released even though an earlier movie based on this story was released while not as flowing as the movie the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life containing many of abagnale 's earlier mistakes lessons we do n't get to see in the movie on the other hand many parts of it do seem to be missing such as why air france would take such an interest in catching frank even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly american based this is an interesting read as a background to the movie and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie 's major storylines
not a reader of fiction fantasy therefore picked up a copy of catch me if you can '' from a bookstore yesterday seen the film more than loved the film loved the characters loved the plot loved the book even more ca n't put it down the story just flows perfectly makes you wonder what franky can do at the age of etc a real inspiration the book 's plot is better than the movie would have been great to read it before watching the still good to read it after watching the overall it 's a great book finished it in a da
ideal for anyone with an interest in evading capture
this book helped me focus my mind on my weight loss i lost 65 lbs and have kept it off for a year now i am buying multiple copies for my friends and relatives ! the psychology of permanent weight loss is the most important thing and this book really helped me change my way of thinking about food and exercise
once upon a time martians and venusians met fell in love and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences then they came to earth and amnesia set in they forgot they were from different planets based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals men are from mars women are from venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships now viewed as a modern classic this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict does n't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow do n't be too surprised when you are reading this book and you recognize someone and some situation that is eerily like your own
if you are young under 30 this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex if you are older this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned or things that you missed in the school of everyday life for both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others
this book has really good advice and insight that makes sense the only downside is that the references to martians '' and venusians '' gets annoying after awhile
very intuitive well written reader voice is a bit annoying but tolerable
this book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences for example men and women have different values men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent women need to express how they feel about their problems while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring if everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better the book however is at times dry reading wil roese
there are varying differences between men and women and gray takes his time in this book to explain what they are what i got from it was a new perspective a new way to understanding what needs to be understood how to interact with the opposite sex what 's most important is to take the time to actually listen without formualing what you 're going to say next i can see why this book is so popular now along with this one i also recommend man magnet
once in a while a book speaks so strongly to so many people that it does the impossible it is popular and worthwhile the best part is that this book gives simple pragmatic execrcises to change communication for the better get the book and stay married another great reading that i recommend is in the meantime '' by vanzan
this book has become so popular that terminology from this book has entered our popular culture calling a woman a venusian for example but my opinion is that this is well earned and hopefully a plus for helping men and women understand one another some criticism leveled at this book is that it is too general and to say men are like this and women are like that '' is a disservice to both poppycock i say ! it 's refreshing to read a book that may help you understand the general '' psychological and linguistic make up of an average '' man or woman i find this type of reading far more useful than all the cultural relativism that has bogged down our understanding of each other where we seem afraid to look at groups as just that groups men are a group and thus have certain statistically average traits this is supported in gray 's book by very revealing comments from his seminars the basic premise of this book is to help decode '' the opposite sex 's langauge when a man says it 's ok '' it means i want to figure this out on my own and i 'd rather you did n't offer unsoliticed advice that makes me feel you do n't trust me '' when a woman says it 's ok '' it usually means i am really upset and i need you to pull this conversation out of me i am going to withdraw now because i feel you are not trying to understand me and i need to see you take action before i can begin to trust you and feel more loving again '' i have found some of gray 's suggestions to be very helpful when asking my bf will you '' instead of can you '' i find i am very satisfied with how things go when i ask will '' which gives him choice to say yes or no '' rather than can '' which many men interpret as being demanding and without choice these subtle distinctions can be quite mind blowing when you first read about them but start putting them into practice or observing how men and women typically communicate and the words they use and you will find gray 's observations to be very helpful i am very happy i read this book it was recommended to me by a friend of mine and i have gone on to recommend it to other friends it really does serve as a sort of pocket reference guide '' to the opposite sex and it is empowering and liberating to realize that we are linguistically completely different when we better know how the other communicates it is then that we can transcend our differences and begin to communicate truly as equals i recommend this book without reservation
the book chronicles tidy snapshots of the lives and careers of 4 different men whose influence in corporate regulation remains unrivaled i particularly enjoyed the chapter on brandeis it is terribly unfortunate to contemporary american society that a man like justice louis brandeis is not still alive and a sitting judge with the supremes brandeis 's intellect and legacy puts the 9 slugs currently sitting on the bench to shame
a young woman and her son are murdered and their home burned down the man who did it gets caught in the fire and ends up in the hospital the woman 's brother joe lassiter a professional investigator begins to probe into why his sister and nephew were killed it all leads him to 17 other women and their young sons all conceived at the same fertility clinic who have been murdered in the exact same circumstances the man who killed lassiter 's sister escapes from the hospital with the help from members of a strange sect of catholocism called umbra domini who appear to be behind the killings lassiter must go to italy and investigate the odd doctor who conceived the children and what he was trying to achieve the genesis code is a quick read the pace is fast and it 's an interesting plot although this territory has been mined in many other novels and after you read about the doctor and consider the title of the book you know the secret pretty much from the beginning despite this if you like thrillers the genesis code is a good one
this book is a great book do n't get me wrong but has a slow beginning slow enough that i actually became discouraged and thought about putting the book away but once the book really gets going it is thrilling and very fast paced if you can make it through the initial crawl and into the heart of the book you will not at all be disappointed for sticking with this novel the concept of this book is fairly simple something in the scientific world is being done that the church strongly disproves of enough disproval that it drives them to kill the victims are all the same a mother and a male child under the age of 4. the victims that are targeted all have one thing in common they all went to a clinic that was doing top of the end research and was very successful at allowing those that were infertile or too old the possibility to have children the clinic helps out those who want to carry children and are otherwise deemed untreatable and also carrying out research that could alter the world forever an extremely delicate subject that threatens to change the way our entire history as human beings is viewed through the whole debacle many lives are lost in hope of protecting something deemed sacred the thing that is terrifying about this book is that it could actually happen the idea is fairly far fetched but in some discreet lab i could actually see research of this kind unfolding the fact that john case dreamed up the idea shows that maybe others out there have thought or even tried this idea out the epilogue of this book is just fantastic and could actually lead to the writing of a second in the series something that would have the potential to be far superior to its predecessor overall i really did like this book a book that opened my eyes to the writing of john case something i look forward to exploring in the future brian bowe
has it been so long 1998 this is one of the first books that i reviewed on the internet i was asked to write it and made me a john case fan this book deals with a fertiliy clinic that has amazing donors and the plans from the church to stop it the last page is a catch your breath ending a stranger in a local bookstore asked me if i 'd ever read john case he was happy i knew the book i was proud of that first review and still like to dabble in writing of course books like case 's make it easy
this book is one of the five best i have ever read it is very thourough and in our scientific world who knows read this book
i just finished reading this book and wow ! it was great ! i really had trouble putting it down the plot was very convincing and i just loved the ending there was a surprise on every page including the last page as a writer the two things i was most impressed with in addition to the wonderful plot was how case created such a sense of place i really felt like i was there in every scene and i could really visualize the space i also thought he did such a good job of nailing the dialogue each character sounded different one could imagine someone speaking english as a second language yet it was not difficult to read i thought the information about the relics in the catholic church was especially interesting and also all the technical cloning stuff made me realize that this entire plot is not so it would make a great movie
i use to read grisham and patterson before they got irritating and case puts them to shame i loved this book the idea was amazing cloning from well i ca n't tell you because that will spoil it i would highly recommend this compared to eighth day which was not that great i know it may have seemed that the characters are like countless others in these types of books but i still liked the story and the end gave me some chills
the genesis code a thriller by john case is a today 's thriller it could have been written for today or tomorrow reads very much true to life people beware ! there is someone waiting around each and every corner
this calendar features some of alex ross 's best paintings and action figures from january to december there is a year full of heros
the most gorgeous artwork in comic books contains the most extraordinary artwork of alex ross superman batman wonder woman the justice league etc even ! a comics fan i recieved this as a christmas gift and i read it again and again a for comic book fans
to call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the genius alex ross is not presented in chronological order but rather starts with the most popular characters superman batman and then moves on to other work such as justice league of america kingdom come alan moore etc alex ross is arguably the greatest visual artist of our time as far as i am concerned his work is up there with picasso da vinci and degas this book takes the reader in a journey of alex ross 's incredible work what ross and this book have in common are the incredible attention to detail and color the art presented in this book is so rich in color it is almost unreal the pictures carry unbelievable detail down to the pores on the faces of the superman and batman sculptures i have never seen such a visual fest in any other comic or book i guarantee you you will not be disappointed it does n't even matter whether you are a comic book fan or not ross 's modern day interpretation in the recreation of the art work from and comic book covers is so nostalgic and professional it makes you appreciate his talent even more this is one book not to miss the print quality is extremely high and pictures carry a ridiculous amount of detail and color especially if you are a superman or batman fan you are on for a treat as they are most prominently featured in this book this is one great book i have always been a huge alex ross fan but thanks to this book i now feel like i know him personally through his art presented in this book as well as the narration in the text that accompanies the pictures one last note get the hardcover if you can the art work on the sleeve is much better than the paperback cover and the art work on the front and back of the hard cover book is simply incredible
dc comics fans who love comic art collections must have mythology the dc comics art of alex ross it 's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters ross ' art brought to life over the decades from superman and flash to green lantern included also is ross ' new comic book series justice new sketches and an oversized format which helps display and profile in full color ross ' entire line of dc comics superheroes an original superman and batman story written by graphic designer chip kidd a of robin 's origin written by paul dini plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover mythology appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own

this is the perfect gift for the comic book fan who has every comic book also looks great on a coffee table
this book was so impressive we were glad we bought it for our friend ! she loves it and did n't put it down all day after receiving it
more an inside in ross ' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters beautiful boo
this book will astonish you even before you open it the jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of dc superman and batman and below the jacket you 'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every dc superhero battling versus their respective villains with an introduction from m night shyamalan the book presents alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him even though he affirms this did n't happen take a look at her mom 's works and try to believe him he then presents the dc characters one by one the batman session has some pages dedicated to the joker only no other villains are shown the early drawings original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers posters or special editions analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what ross wants to project with his images i do n't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only you get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece the ideas scratched on a piece of paper the drawings and possible posing and then the final image there are pictures i has never seen until i got this book when i first saw them my fisrt thought was i need to frame these ' which came up as a bad idea as i would have had to frame the entire book the abandoned ideas for of villainy ' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed his takes on mad magazine alan moore the animated style and world 's finest are also present then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'kingdom come ' from the early concepts and ideas passing through sketches until the realization of the project the possible prequel that never occurred kingdom ' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by ross are shown uncle sam is also analyzed near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were then we have this section called process ' in which we obviously get to see how alex works using the book 's cover as example the final part of the book is a very nice bonus a special story written by chip kidd and alex ross created exclusively for this book indeed a great piece of collection this book is a must for comic book fans the hard cover presentation the paper in which it is printed and the bonus stuff are worth the price to pay
to my mind this is the best of michael lewis 's work his style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark and his writing is at top form next examines the changes wrought by the internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential mainly in the form of vignettes there is no beginning middle or end so if you 're looking for a story with a plot line this is likely not going to appeal to you the lack of story line is however what i found compelling the theme of the book is there 's this bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides '' this is pretty much quintessential michael lewis he finds an individual or an event or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift a deliberate choice of words here since moneyball dealt with the emergence of sabrmetrics whose acolytes all seem to have read the structure of scientific revolutions ''
michael lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud i think i learned more about wall street from liar 's poker '' than all the great serious tomes i 've read while at the same time enjoying it as pure farce and yet i was left with an increased respect for the people and institutions how is that even possible after liar 's poker '' i needed to read more of lewis but i avoided next '' for a long time because the internet is my wall street '' a place with which i am intimately familiar books on the subject thus tend to annoy me as i keep picking out nits where i feel the dilettante has gotten something wrong or missed the point boy did i underestimate michael lewis next '' is as brilliant as liar 's poker '' hilarious and incredibly informative he intuitively captures the significance of the internet the way it breaks down all the old silos of expertise and authority and distributes them into the homes of everyone the best part is probably the description of jonathan lebed the online trader charged with securities fraud by the sec and the complete inability of the sec to come to grips with the absurdity of the situation
next the future just happened is about how the internet is changing the world lewis profiles jonathan lebed a teenage stock market wizard the sec says he was a stock market manipulator lewis is n't so sure a teenage law expert who has never studied law a teenager in england who is using gnutella software as a springboard to i do n't know take over the world i guess it seems obvious from the first half of the book that teenage boys are using the internet to become rich powerful and influential so maybe all the internet has really done is speed things up by a few decades but lewis throws the among us a small bone by interviewing an aging rock group that uses the internet to raise money for a tour an woman who participates in webtv polls and the creators of tivo the second half of the book is a bit unconvincing boxes big deal those teenagers rule the book and it would seem the world lewis as usual writes an engaging book it pulls you right in and moves quickly the lebed story itself makes the book worth your time
i 've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet but found this one a notch above the rest whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects this one went a lot deeper and touched on the meta changes underlying society but far from being a grand generalist thesis lewis grounds his observations in real stories that are highly readable his experience as a professional writer shines through on every page the only reason i did n't give this five stars was that i feel lewis missed some fundamental factors in his analysis of the three teenagers whose stories constitute the bulk of the book i agree with him that children are more likely to leverage new technology because they can adopt and create new personas quicker than adults who carry along years of baggage but there is perhaps an explanation much closer to home the reason kids can rebel against the insiders '' and push the limits with such dedication and passion is because they are not paying off mortgages and education for their own kids marcus arnold the teenage prodigy legal expert claimed with total naivety that he was handicapped against practising lawyers because he had 6 hours of school every day hogwash ! the lawyers were handicapped because every hour of their day had to show some revenue return to cover their costs of living and when the outsiders '' bemoan the former outsiders who capitulate and sellout their technological ventures to the highest bidding insiders '' it is invariably because they are no longer been funded by dad and need to start footing their own bills notwithstanding this is an excellent book
without beating about the bush let me state that this is one of the best books i have read on the effects of the internet on our society the book starts with the account of jonathan lebed a 14 year old boy from new jersey jonathan last year made half a million dollars in 6 months using nothing but his savvy and the internet using accounts and aol and jonathan and had bought stock then using multiple fictitious names posted hundreds of messages on yahoo finance message boards recommending the stock to others as a result the stock would go up and jonathan would make a nice profit on the sale the book also looks into how another teenager marcus arnold registered himself as a law expert at and soon reached the number one place in popularity lewis explores tv feedback technologies like the ones developed by tivo stock ticker tivo and sonicblue stock ticker sblu and how these technologies could affect us all in the near future lewis has a lot of information at his disposal and he disseminates it in a fascinating way he has a lively style of writing and a great turn of phrase for instance the old hotshot capitalist was so you could use his brain to slice salami '' it cracked me up a great read highly informative highly interesting highly recommended http
it 's an engaging account from an anthropologist who went to live with an inuit family she gives a very candid account of her own difficulties in adapting to their culture
spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters just when you think grisham ca n't do it again he does it anyway
i read legal thrillers to escape i love them but with a bit of guilty pleasure as one consuming junk food for the mind not this one though this book combines the thrill of escapist reading with a wholesome and affirming message that feeds the heart and mind
grisham delivers again with this great story about the dead billionaire 's strange last will and the redemption of the broken lawyer who sees the light this has a spiritual message that is subtle sincere and uplifting yet not beaten over your head you 'll walk away understanding how money can be a curse and if you do n't believe that give this book a try
i do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as i started it john grisham describes places and people like very few can do if you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else i find something better to do loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read
with every grisham book i read i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense but to insert other elements to make this human as well for once we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain however this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune however she does not know this a lawyer is sent to find her and in the process undergoes a fundamental change of his own this story takes place in washington maryland west virginia and the rain forests along the border in typical grisham fashion he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight you can envision the rainforest and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue the pages literally turn themselves do not start this novel before going to bed or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down
the filthy rich are interesting missionaries are interesting the jungles of brazil are interesting lawyers are interesting ok lawyers are n't interesting but grisham sure makes them seem interesting and his book does a great job of tying together a wealthy spoiled family to a single woman living in brazil working as a missionary the testament is more than just a story i believe the story shows the great difference between living for personal pleasure and living for something greater than one 's self in the end which life really ends in the most satisfaction and pleasure does chasing money and pleasure really result in happiness no i believe grisham excellently illustrates this principle through the story of the phelan family and rachel lane the book is very easy to read and the story is told cleverly grisham 's accounts of brazil missionaries and lawyers are all based on his own personal experiential research which enhances the book
john grisham has done it again i had read this book originally a year after release and i just finished my second read and though it all started to come back to me as i read it it was still an exciting as it was the first time that says a lot about this book a billionaire the tenth richest man in america has all his heirs come in to prove he is sane and competent before signing his last will and testament which he does right before he commits suicide in front of those still present and of course as he leaves out each and every known heir from his will and as you learn how greedy and selfish they are you are pleased he did he does pay off all his children 's debt and leaves the remainder of his holdings to his illegitimate daughter no one knew he had nor does anyone know where she is his law firm sends a addict just out of rehab for the fourth time to find her he finds her an who has dedicated her life to god and is working deep in the jungles of brazil i found the book a very fast read that has some plot twist and is well written well worth the read
once again it is another good read by grisham it is hard to think what my will would be like if i get over a million dollars i can not see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle
troy phelan is an old man who is dying fast he is the richest man on the earth with a net worth of over 11 billion for the past several months he has been writing and rewriting his will and testament to split his money as he sees fit his three and seven children all anxiously await his death and their chance to claim a piece of the 11 billion pie the first of many surprises happens early on with phelan 's death and more importantly what is in the contents of the will in his last will before his death there was not a single word about any of his or children the only name given any money to was an illegitimate child of phelan named rachel lane a missionary living deep in the swaps of the pantanal in brazil this kicks of a vicious legal battle nate o'riley becomes the one man who can change the outcome of the matter given the job of finding the woman in the jungle where every decision can mean life of death the quest of nate is an adventure full of suspense action discovery and surprises meanwhile the legal battle in the states becomes bigger and bigger while the magnitude of the stakes and the personality of the characters begins to really come out john grisham took two intertwining settings and plots to create the best of his books that i have read i thought that all the plot twists made for a very quick read at many points in the book i felt that i was n't going to be able to stop reading because of all the action suspense and the writing style
this is the story of paul vincent galvin who at the time of his death in 1959 was chairman of the board of motorola and one of the most dynamic leaders on the american business scene the founders touch is also the exciting account af a vast business buit from scratch and the story of a man whose life reflected the changing world of the twentieth century excerpt from book 's back cove
it 's been a while since i 've read one of janet evanovich 's stephanie plum novels but a sudden need for light reading found ten big ones at the book store plum 's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after joe morelli or ranger how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed definitely light fare even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic he not only wants stephanie dead but he also wants her end to be spectacular stephanie 's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend joe morelli again gorge on jelly donuts and go into hiding at one of ranger 's lairs of course this does n't work as well as it should because even ranger 's soap is too sexy for words and stephanie glutton for punishment that she is she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile so you see this is standard stephanie plum fare lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss usually with bad timing my issue with evanovich 's books is n't with any particular one but with what happens if you read too many at one time stephanie 's biggest problem is herself a decided lack of common sense which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter but leaves her gun in the cookie jar in four hundred pages this is funny but if you 've been reading a lot in a row the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is vu all over again after a break of a year or so this goes away and i found ten big ones a pleasure to read it introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history by all means if you need a break from the weight of the world take the time to read this
i picked up the first stephanie plum novel out of curiousity and was n't disappointed i 've gone on to read every book in the series and have enjoyed every one rarely does a book have me laughing out loud but i do with each one of these the characters are wonderful grandma mazur is great she may be old but she does n't let that stop her she 'll try anything anytime i love ranger and joe if i had two guys like that in my life i 'd have a hard time deciding between them too i love the family dinners the conversations are hilarious you can picture stephanie 's dad trying so hard to tune everyone out and not quite succeeding and lula ! she gets better with every book sure the situations and the characters can be a little out there at times but is n't that what makes a great book i love to get lost in a good book and tune out everything around me i 'm starting the book next i already have 12 and ca n't wait for the to come out i recommend this series to everyone give it a chance and read it for what it 's supposed to be escapism there 's too little of that these days and i think we all need it to some point in our lives

this is my routine for beginning a stephanie plum novel i grab a few peanut butter oreos and a glass of milk and curl up on the couch in my comfy pants i open the book and read the first paragraph the way i see it life is a jelly doughnut you do n't really know what it 's about until you bite into it and then just when you decide it 's good you drop a big glob of jelly on your best '' and that 's when i burrow just a little deeper into the couch cushions confident that janet evanovich has written another winner i wo n't be able to put down moments of hilarity abound in ten big ones evanovich 's tenth foray into the world of stephanie plum in this outing stephanie out of that sheer bad luck she ca n't seem to escape witnesses one of a chain of robberies by the red devil '' a gang member who 's been terrorizing trenton 's convenience stores and delis for months not only does she see the robbery and inevitably get her car blown up but she also sees the red devil 's face which unfortunately makes her a target for two of trenton 's most prominent scariest gangs since she does n't want to put love joe morelli or her family in danger steph retreats into hiding in the only place she knows no one will ever find her a place she only stumbled upon by sheer luck good this time ranger 's apartment be still my heart more bad news is awaiting her outside the walls of ranger 's plush digs however the red devil 's gang has hired a contract killer called the junkman '' to ferret her out and to show no mercy when he finds her but stephanie still has a job to do and reading about her attempts to bring in her ftas while at the same time being on the lookout for her assassin is pure entertainment all our favorite characters are back including sally sweet extraordinaire he has n't been around since four to score and he makes a triumphant return in ten big ones by adding school bus driver think otto from the simpsons and wedding planner for steph 's sister valerie to his there 's lula of course whose closet has no end of and spandex clothing if you could call it clothing and granda mazur who 's 70 but looks 100 and joe morelli who loves steph almost as much as he is exasperated by her and of course there 's ranger enigmatic sexy man of mystery who stephanie and me too finds completely irresistible steph 's ftas are great characters too as usual among them is a woman who robbed a frito lay truck and has since developed an addiction to doritos whether you like this installment or not will come down to your individual preference people who prefer the more plum plots say that five times fast ! may not be in love with this one the plot of ten big ones tends to meander stephanie takes lots of showers eats lots of doughnuts and feeds rex quite a few morsels in this one but those who read the stephanie plum books for the characters who feel like evanovich 's trenton gang is a second family you will love this one all our favorites are there in all their glory being just as goofy as we remember i 'm a member of the second group of readers i really enjoyed ten big ones aside from a rather abrupt ending janet evanovich has offered up another winner on to number 11 i can already hear the oreos calling my name
some writers are trashing this offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her so what ! i laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute have fun buy enjoy
after reading this series in order and just finishing ten big ones i still have n't figured out what the titles have to do with the books other than that confusion i continue to be delighted with the characters and the plots stephanie plum continues to be featured in this series in the first installation she had to become a bounty hunter in order to pay her bills stephanie has absolutely no skill as a bounty hunter and relies more on blind luck than anything else which is exactly what we see in ten big ones as stephanie is trying to decide on nachos or a sandwich for lunch she witnesses a robbery when the theft goes bad partly due to her sidekick lula destroying the vehicle the notorious red devil removes his mask for a split second giving stephanie a chance to see his face seeing a criminal in action is bad enough but when he belongs to a local gang the slayers things go from bad to worse we 're given the usual group of support characters in ten big ones i have to say that the plot is secondary to catching up with the happenings in each of the support casts ' lives i adore grandma mazur and just the mention of her name brings a smile to my face she 's feisty and refuses to be the sedate grandmotherly type she relishes in stephanie 's escapades and joins her any chance she 's given lula is becoming more of a partner to stephanie as the series progresses and she 's still the same street smart smart mouthed that we 've all come to know and love but ten big ones gives us a bit more detail about the ever elusive ranger bounty hunter extraordinaire stephanie is on a hit list from the slayers and has to hide to stay alive she discovers ranger 's apartment and moves in while he 's out of town i never would have guessed that the apartment is luxurious and full of amenities not thought to be associated with ranger like ironed sheets and towels so thick you get lost in them other sub cast members are delved into a bit more in this book like the return of sally sweet the drag queen rocker does evanovich ever have normal '' characters no thank god ! these are much more fun ! seems sally has become a school bus driver during the day and drag queen rocker only at night he 's loveable even though he 's confusing lula is still around and enjoyable but we do n't see much of vinnie the owner of vincent plum bail bonds i 'm waiting for the book in which we get more info on him now that should be interesting ! the plot is a bit confusing stephanie sees the red devil he 's part of a gang so she 's placed on a hit list huh why is she on a hit list he 's not one of the head guys he 's just a member of the gang she retreats to ranger 's apartment and when he returns we 're not given the romance we 'd expect instead they dance around each other yet again and joe morelli stephanie 's off again boyfriend does n't even have a coronary when he finds out she 's hidden out with ranger things that make ya go hmmm but not for long because the plot does n't have to be solid for this series to be enjoyable the characters alone make the price of admission worth it ! if you 're looking for a solid mystery plot with fast action and a mind boggling journey this is definitely not the book or series for you if you want to enjoy a few hours and feel like you 're at home with friends and if you want to be entertained then pick up this series and enjoy you 'll soon feel like part of the group and not be able to wait for more stories from them
a very thorough analysis of the contemporary trends in western europe from an american writer who lives there bawer starts with an indepth description of the european social structure and the state of mind of the europeans since that exposed them to the risk of being taken over by an intolerant but dedicated idealogy he concludes that western europe as we know and cherish is moving towards its own destruction through a takeover by the wave of muslim immigration he points the main reasons in the tolerance for the intolerant by the multiculturalism that is dominating the dogmatic thinking of the european elites and by the pasivity of the europeans who lost their respect for their own values and culture bawer backs his thesis by both statistical facts quotes from local articles lectures and report as well as testimonies from private conversations he had with native europeans a must read book well written that would bring tears to your eyes if you have a sentiment to the old world and an appreciation to its vanishing moral values
this is an excellent and insightful book that should be required reading in high schools i have never been to europe and must say that after reading while europe slept i have zero desire to go for years i have ranted about the scourge of political correctness '' to my friends and family and refuse to partake in it this book is a great illustration of how destruction pc is i wonder if europe will wake up before it 's too late
in his book bruce bawer outlines the negative impact of immigration policies in western europe essentially bawer points out that instead of encouraging integration western europe focuses on multiculturalism multiculturalism is the idea that new cultures maintain a separate identity even though immigrants have taken up residence in a new nation ideally multiculturalism is acceptance of all cultures but that is rarely seen in reality multiculturalism in western europe has created a culture of fear a culture so fearful of offending muslims that westerners are sacrificing their freedoms and liberties to appease a growing muslim minority the combination of islam 's intolerance for the west and the west 's fear of being perceived as racist has led to a society where dutch women wear hijabs traditional muslim head covers in public for fear of being raped the murder rate in sweden has increased to nearly double that of the united states the only hope for europe bawer claims is for europeans to take a tough stance on extremism europe must punish deport and deny entry to people who preach hate europe must be willing to force immigrant children to go to secular schools and force immigrants themselves to learn the national language europeans must be willing to defend their freedoms otherwise we 'll see a europe ruled by sharia law strict literal implementation of the koran 's law
this book really serves to answer some questions i had about the current state of the world in general europe islam us eurpoe islam the world amazing some good details but the accounts of the problems in europe are more propelling imho could n't put it down
i finished this book very quickly and found it to be both very illuminating on the experience and the foibles of the europeans who raised on socialism and convinced of their sophistication have lost the ability to comprehend much less deal with a violent ideology that wants to destroy their 'utopia ' the author alternates between describing personal incidents the assault on his partner in downtown olso in the middle of the day defending his country 's history to brainwashed socialists and events and discourse growing crime rates segregation at schools growing threats on free speech and expression of specific artists and politicos my highlights imams religious leaders claim state welfare should be considered jizah sp protection money must pay to muslims in lands women are betrothed against their will at an early age their husbands typically come from the family homeland and after marriage they are legally entitled to join their spouse in europe this keeps muslim women 'under the yoke ' of traditionalism via physical abuse capitulation actual politicians defend violent imams and their rhetoric and chastise the native born for any implied criticism towards the religion of islam or any individual muslim political capitulation norwegian lawmakers suggest that norwegian women alter their dress to become more sensitive to muslim attitudes the attitude that a woman is responsible for her own rape also attempts to undermine freedom of speech go largely unchallenged native born muslims gen immigrants are incubated from the democratic values by their parents and raised to believe that infidels are pigs their women are whores and that they must eventually take over the country cons a bit short also one standing question why did import cheap laborers from turkey iran iraq morocco and not europeans while several offical studies regarding crime changing demographics and opinion polls are referred to i was hoping for more substantial coverage of the raw data a bibliography would have been nice too so we can check the data for ourselves is n't really a con but a misfortune this book was probably hitting the bookstores around the same time as the controversy erutpted surrounding the prophet muhammad cartoons the author 's insights on this incidence would have made a brilliant finale what i found most compelling was the author 's assessment of the european mentality the internationalist and appeasment way of thought germinated in an until recently sheltered cocoon of intellectual hubris
while europe slept is one of those books that is a must read for every american today the author is so knowledgable about the europeans and their view of america that he dispels the notion that americans are the bad guys '' sure we have our faults but not in comparison to western europe thinking bawer points out that the elite run europe without any concern for the common man it was interesting to note that the elite do not want the muslims to integrate and they allow great amounts of funds to provide welfare to the muslims therefore they are jobless but receive welfare that allows them to attend mosques which preach against democracy jews and the country in which they reside muslim law and practices are paramount to them however breaking the law they often do or laws of their country of residence and citizenship appears to be common muslim enclaves want to be left alone and ignore all other laws courts and police the current path of european thinking and governing will according to the author lead to muslim domination of that country this is such an excellent book and that all americans should read it to put europe in the proper prospective and to realize the continuing threat of extreme terrorism perpetrated by extremist muslims will not just go away
i can understand why the secular left does not the christians here in the usa but what i do n't understand is how they seem completely oblivious to what their fate would be if osama and those like him win this war we are in the radical left needs to read this book someone get a copy to rosie odonnell and michael moore
bruce bawer 's book is informative and covers quite a lot of ground in its description of the insidious nature of radical islam in europe and how the political elite are more enamoured with political power over a propagandised electorate instead of applying themselves to the defence of freedom but that is what european style government is all about despite the contemporary terrorism of radical islam and is like democracy the antithesis of freedom whilst radical islam is a major threat in itself because of its inclination to subvert and murder to achieve its goals the biggest problem that europeans must address is the entire nature of the political systems that all european nations are governed by in association with the additional layer of that is the eu before europeans can banish the evils of radical islam they must swiftly move to a higher ethics devoid of so that they have moral certitude about what must be done with the radical islamists even if that demands that the radical islamists are expelled from western europe by whatever force is necessary i was somewhat perplexed by bruce bawer 's relentless eulogising of america 's virtues even though they are many and laudable in comparison to those of europe since it it is well understood that the american administration is in the throes of implementing a draconian diminution of freedom under the pretext of allied to demands form christian fundamentalist groups who have vastly too much influence over politicians and the judiciary it can often come across like a propaganda piece for washington SMILE readers of this book should also read celsius by michael gove for a more focused analysis of the problem of radical islam
best of its ilk the rainmaker surpasses most legal thrillers without a doubt a quick read start to finish a great novel this book as defiantly started me on grisham saga that wo n't end until i 've read all his books i highly recommend this to any one who has any remote interest in the law or just reading in general a
i was a little reluctant to read this one mainly because i was so bored by grisham 's the client '' and because i heard this was a funny '' book usually funny means excessively silly and cute however just a few pages into this novel i knew it was different maybe becuase i could relate to the rudy character having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what id be able to do with my degree it kept me reading the writing is personable like it 's really written by a young man just out of law school the humor in it is just right not over the top silly but enough to make me laugh every so often it 's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching shows on tv a few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story particularly the ending though by that time i was more than willing to cut grisham a little slack and overlook it the previous 500 pages of enjoyment i got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was maybe a little clumsy whenever i read one of grisham 's novels i think that the main characters in some way reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney all i can say is that i am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author i highly recommend this book
this book is a good read fun story and the characters are very likeable

it was true to the movie which was wonderful i highly reccommend the book and amazon offered it at a much lower price than barnes and noble
i love this storyline baylor is a lovable character and has a true sense of what justice should be and he makes certain that his clients do not go unheard
this novel is an underdog story of a young lawyer rudy baylor barely out of law school who goes against the big guns that of a very corrupt insurance company defended by lawyers from a big prestigious law firm you can not help but root for rudy who put himself through college and law school and who is so desperate for a job in law that his leads to a very low point he finds work from a corrupt lawyer however through circumstances beyond his control rudy soon finds himself with his own struggling practice with a paralawyer grisham invention named deck deck is an unattractive unethical guy who does what it takes to get the job done he is an amusing character and rings i think that most people know someone like him or know of someone like him nonetheless in the end i feel sorry for how things turned out for him rudy 's biggest case is the blacks great benefit an insurance company the blacks are a senior couple with a dying son who needs a bone marrow operation that gb will not pay for gb preys on the with medical policies that do n't cover much at all in reality do n't read the following stuff within the parentheses else it may ruin one of the best moments in the book gb 's employee manuals for claims handlers and underwriters instruct the gb employee to deny every claim initially ! they only pay for claims that do n't cost much when threatened with litigation i really hope that insurance companies like gb do n't exist it is merely a pollyanna hope i suppose however if we did n't have evil companies or evil organizations agencies etc we would n't have great courtroom dramas or just plain drama things are more interesting when you have conflicts involving good versus evil or some forms of those opposing realities after reading this book i know why grisham is a bestselling author he delivers the goods in an exceptional way i find myself just flowing along with his 's so readable there are parts in this particular story that are n't that believable most of the breaks that rudy gets in the case against gb but somehow it does n't diminish the excitement of the story
rudy baylor is a law student in his last year of law school as one of his projects he is required to offer free legal advice to senior citizens at the local nursing home little did he realize that he would meet dot and buddy black who would present to him the lawsuit of all times one that would make him a rainmaker '' rudy jumped right in and fought for the black 's son donny ray who was diagnosed with leukemia and then later denied medical treatment by a large insurance company for no apparent reason rudy is thorough and compassionate in his work and never gives up the case he fights for his client even though he has little courtroom experience an exciting novel
edmund burke wrote reflections on the revolution in france in 1789 which was four years before the rise of the fanatical jacobins and the execution murder of louis xvi this book was not only well written but very prophetic on the tragic events that were part of the french revolution burke showed historical insight and warned both the british and the french what was going to happen burke cited conditions in france prior to the french revolution he certainly did not give a false representation of the economic and social conditions in france but he was clear that while not perfect the french had advanced culture and tolerable living standards he also warned the french that abrupt changes without recourse to tradition and legal norms were dangerous and would end in tyranny readers should be aware that burke 's assessment of the french political system was that the french had reasonble politcal freedom and prosperity to destroy this political system would end in political disruption social and political violence lack of and the rise of tyrannical military leaders one should note burke 's assessment of the members of the french national assembly which was vacilating and subject to the whims of any political interest group '' was serious he suggested that military officers would be among those pleaders '' would be military officers who would be difficult to control he also warned that when someone who understood the art of command got control of the military officers the days of the french republic and the national assembly were over the military commander would be in total control and this is exactly what happened when napolean i started to exhibit military genius he quickly got power by a coup d ' etat in 1799 and became the french emperor by 1804. burke 's warnings of disaster and tragedy were fullfilled from at least 1792 until 1815 the french were almost constantly at war with most europeans while the french empire expanded beyond anything prior french monarchs ever dreamed of the collapse of the french empire came quickly and the french empire was ended by 1815 at terrible cost in both blood treasure burke warned of these dangers and his predictions were accurate burke lived just long enough to see the rise and fall of the maniacal jacobins which included the reigh of terror and the execution of king louis xvi and his wife marie antionette had burke lived a few more years he could have resorted to remarking i told you so '' edmund burke has been defined as a conservative which is true however burke was not a reactionary burke realized that progress whatever that may mean is often slow and within the confines of historical tradition legal norms and established law burke warned his readers to use modern parlance against wipe the slate clean '' burke clearly understood that to wipe the slate clean meant mass dislocation of men and ultimately mass executions mass murder subsequent modern political revolutions vindicate this view readers may wonder why burke expressed support for the american revolution but strongly opposed the french revolution a careful examination of these revolutions provides the answer the american revolutionaries '' were arguing for their rights of englishmen '' which had a long tradition in great britain henry ii started the use grand juries the english had the right of trial by jury by the time of edward i the fact is the american colonists wanted to rules of common law and long established legal traditions to apply to them the british wanted to rule the american colonists with administrative law using clever bureaucrats as burke would probably have called them rather than use british constitutional law and the common law which many american colonists demanded the french on the other hand wanted to replace a weak monarch with clever bureaucrats '' which burke knew very well could not work in france readers should note that thomas paine wrote a response to burke 's reflections on the revolution titled the rights of man while paine 's views were different than those of burke 's paine 's book was just as brilliant as burke 's readers should read both works if they want exposure to profound political thought and excellent writing this is much preferred to the current political nonsense that is pushed by media talking heads and journalists who can not think or write burke and paine were well read men and offered readers history lessons as well as politcal lessons edmund burke 's reflections on the revolution in france is highly recommended regardless of one 's political persuasion this book is not a light read and takes time however one will be better informed and wiser for doing so again this reviewer suggests the reader should read thomas paine 's the rights of man to draw comparisons and contrasts
in 1789 the year of the french revolution burke received a request from a good friend living in france to provide his thoughts on the revoution the one of the finest pieces of political discourse ever written for those encountering burke for the first time his adament defense of the crown and of hereditary succcesion seem to make a hypocrite of this liberal burke however was not defending an absolute monarch who ruled under the charter of divine right but rather pointing out the danger of a perfect democracy whose sovereign the national assembly was compelled not to a moral authority such as a church nor to a fixed consitution in short liberty was safer restricted in civil socity than left unchecked whether you find burke 's analysis consistent with your political leanings or more likely you find his writing very offensive you can appreciate both the efffect of this work on american and european political though as well as the reason and intelligence with which it was written
this small title is actually a letter that the author wrote to a friend in france when edmund burke wrote this letter about the french revolution where the king was overthrown and beheaded by the masses aka jacobins english scholars agree that the result was the finest piece of prose in the english language only a few poets have succeeded in writing something finer whether you agree with burke 's interpretation or not is not the point he penned the finest piece of literature ever in the english language as a historian and social commentator burke is a structural functionalist '' decades before that term was dreamed up he recognizes that the french are not only creatures of their culture but prisoners and to compare them to the english colonists and other insurgents in the american colonies who revolted against the british government is to compare apples and oranges whereas the yankee revolution of 1776 was and the propaganda for rebellion preached from the pulpits the french were railing against the catholic church for keeping people ignorant and in their dark age burke says the french revolution is a revolution without its moorings without the necessary principles to guide individual behavior and without the maintenance of institutions that long provided stability and security what the french philosophes were writing was mere balderdash says burke without their traditions customs and institutitions that had slowly brought the french out of barbarity and into a civilized manner of living burke saw in revolution a rapid decline and fall of the french people into a visciousness of in short burke saw the french revolution as lacking virtue and descending into terrorism whereas the yankee revolution was virtuous and grew into a democracy whether you agree with burke or not and i do not his writing in this letter to a friend is the finest example of english writing to be found and should be read by everyone simply for that reason alone
this is an indispensible essay for anyone who has ever been interested in politics it is composed of beautiful prose crisp logic and perennially relevant material you must read burke to understand the why it is worth being critical of the french revolution and to understand some major reasons for the movement in france
very good in the sequel line but i figured out who dun it '' before i finished the characters are still developing well waiting for the next one i have the whole series

margaret coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the wind river reservation in wyoming and describes the arapahoe customs in wonderful detail in this installment father o'malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the arapahoe and shoshone indians has been and that dead indians can be found on an ancient battle ground when father o'malley goes to investigate he discovers three dead shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles things heat up when the young shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends vicky holden the other main character in the series has entered into a law partnership with adam lone eagle and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling vicky wants to defend frankie montana who is a suspect in the murders and adam tries to persuade her not to take frankie as a client as always author coel creates a wonderful setting and characters and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series
it is hard to believe that margaret coel began her wind river reservation series some ten years ago with the eagle catcher which introduced readers to father john o'malley and defense attorney vicky holden each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between o'malley and holden the latest installment in this series is no exception eye of the wolf begins with a cryptic telephone message that is left for o'malley on an answering machine this leads him to the site of a historic battlefield one that resulted in the slaughter of an arapaho indian village by forces aided by shoshone scouts in modern times arapahos and shoshones are somewhat uneasy neighbors on the wind river reservation with their antagonistic history providing a shadowy backdrop gone but not entirely forgotten but past differences are brought to the forefront when o'malley discovers the bodies of three shoshones on the old battlefield positioned to mimic those of the dead killed in the historic battle frankie montana a chronic client of holden 's is the primary suspect despite montana 's recidivistic tendencies holden does not believe he is capable of murder it eventually becomes clear to holden and o'malley that someone is attempting to revive the conflict between the arapahos and shoshones and that holden has placed herself in terrible danger on behalf of her client while coel has created an extensive backstory contributing to the wind river reservation mythos it is not necessary to read what has transpired before eye of the wolf the tension between o'malley and holden builds from page to page as they struggle to protect the innocent and each other from an unknown malefactor at the same time both are protective of o'malley 's priestly vows even as their emotions practically but subtly beg for violation eye of the wolf is an excellent introduction to the wind river reservation series while providing a welcome return to the area and its people for longtime followers of the series given the longevity of these novels it is clear that coel can continue to explore this beautiful dangerous landscape for as long as she wishes recommended reviewed by joe hartlau
the poetic macabre message shakes up father john o'malley the jesuit pastor at francis on the wind river plantation the caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths not long afterward at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the shoshone betrayed the arapaho to the cavalry three shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here frankie montana who was seen recently arguing with the shoshone and has quite a rap sheet is charged with the triple homicides his lawyer vicky holden believes frankie who insists he is innocent because she knows this low life would do just about anything but not murder as she mounts a defense she wonders if the culprit is cunningly trying to cause an indian war between the two tribes for some unknown reason or a psychopath is avenging the century plus slaughter the latest wind river reservation mystery eye of the wolf is a fabulous legal thriller that uses brutal late nineteenth century carnage as the apparent motive to century murders the story line moves out rather quickly when father o'malley listens to the high pitched poetry of the killer on his voice machine and never takes a breather as vicky tries to prove her client did not commit the crime though circumstantially he appears heading for the fall margaret coel is at her best with this tale that affirms why so many readers feel she is the heir apparent to the hillerman mantle harriet klausner
eye of the wolf by margaret coel isbn 0425205460 due out today 6 september 2005 i was sent an arc of this great book to read for review which i do gladly i had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them especially spirit woman and story teller so was expecting good things i was not disappointed the series follows the adventures of father john o'malley pastor of francis mission on the wind river reservation and tribal attorney vicki holden and apart from a ripping good mystery the author weaves the history of the arapho and the soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life it is not hard to care about the indian priest '' as they call father john or vicky holden i think what i enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well they were brought vividly alive by the author 's words from the first mystery message this is for the indian priest '' everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield but does it this is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish
at a lunch with a studio executive screenwriter john dunne was insisting on a story point in the script that he had written with his wife joan didion the excutive mimed reaching under the table and bringing out '' the monster '' their money to win the argument seven or eight years they toiled on the script that became '' up close and personal '' this is the chronicle of their experiences fascinating and sobering when you realize how things can dissolve and then reappear in a completly different form it is very well told and forshadows his health problems that cost him his life in 2003 that his wife wrote so exquisitly about in the year of magical thinking '' if how movies get made is of any interest to you this and his other film making tale the studio '' will fascinate you
it took eight years to make up close and personal a movie about a television reporter and her mentor starring robert redford and michelle pfeiffer this book by one of the screenplay writers is a must for anyone who wants an example of just how absurd movie making can be from the original story of jessica savitch an ambitious and ultimately young woman dunne 's screenplay transforms over many years and many rewrites into a story that would get disney 's stamp of approval which translates into a feel good movie with an uplifting storyline '' often hilarious and at times moving monster gives you a real feeling for the time skill and patience it takes to create a screenplay just remember this is not an instructional guide to screenplay writing see it rather as a cautionary tale after reading this you may wonder how movies get made at all
even though montgomery did not intend anne of green gables to be a series she still captivates with her eager readers in anne of avonlea there are still quite a few differences anne has grown from a queer '' fiery young girl to a wiser calmer schoolteacher yes a schoolteacher also as we follow anne in this bildungsroman literature the romance between her and gilbert blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first and perhaps this is because anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude altogether my opinion of the book is that it was a good and i sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as anne of green gables
being a montgomery fan helps of course but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the anne of green gables which started it all the writing hold true to the author 's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series my wife and i have been reading these books for years and never tire of them again as with her first work you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time this particlar story starts where the last left off anne is sixteen and her adventure continues i for some reason find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly
red haired with a flaming temper the phenomenal anne shirley is back in her book ! marilla a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing anne up when she was an orphan has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins davy and dora keith anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes like making his sister dora walk the pig fence ! davy s idea of fun includes violence and humor v but only for himself the girls have to teach davy manners which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy anne s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world at school she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students especially paul irving this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen he brings her flowers and calls her sweet teacher her friendship with striking gilbert blythe for calling her hair carrots has grown but what is gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant has diana her bosom friend finally grown up i really enjoyed this book because it talks about anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever i simply couldn t put it down because after every page anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger my mom keeps telling me to go and do work but i can not stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written i like the others in this series you montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life ! referring to the special collectors editio
i love this story echo lodge was great it was about the last book where anne is in avonlea and a little girl very excellent book
this is just a wonderful sequel to anne of green gables it deals with anne 's life after returning to avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college seeing anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad it is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the avonlea village improvement society to which there is some resistance from the avonlea elders at first anne is still of course a kindred spirit but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures which was is just a touch sad but as henderson says all things must change for anyone who liked the first book this is sure to not disappoint
it never ends luckily ! ! ! i will never tire of anne 's wonderful lively imagination in this story anne is sixteen with lovely dark red hair gray twinkling eyes and only seven freckles ! anyways more happens in this story than a change in appearance anne becomes the avonlea schoolma'am and loves her students like crazy especially little paul irving who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher anne and marilla even adopt little twins who also win their love but when diana barry and anne are wandering down the lane one evening they stumble upon the lovely miss lavender she has the same imagination too ! well everything in this story is just as perfect as it 's prequel it 's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels in this case they 're both great
anne of avonlea was almost as good as the first anne book it is about anne 's life as a school teacher in avonlea marilla adopts two mischievous twins and rachel lynde moves in so life is never dull for anne at the school house or at green gables you could read it on its own but i recommend you read anne of green gables first
i read this book when i was 12 and loved it now i 'm 21 and recendly read it again and i liked it even more the plot is great the characters are alive and the writing is must for anyone that wants to laugh love and cry with the town from avonlea
the book encourages students to explore their own strengths and weaknesses and prompts them to recognize aspects of themselves in ways they probably had n't thought before most of us are quite curious about what our strengths might be and with this book the student 's is n't a painful process rather than offering a step by step list of do 's and don'ts the approach taken here is to help the student develop a highly individualized action plan to help them take control managing their coursework it 's a relatively hefty book at least compared to others i 've seen in this genre but this does n't detract
this book is really helpful for those who have had difficulty with studying and time management it also helps highlight some of those everything i need to know i really did learn in kindergarten '' moments often i do n't keep textbooks because i know i 'll never use most of them again this book is exactly the opposite in that i know i will use it again be it with relationship conflicts time management a reminder to detach from my identities or anything else there is such a wealth of helpful information that i fail to understand the ranting low reviews apparently some people have nothing better to do with their time than bitch pity really
i found this book to be full of endless tips on how to study and make the best use of my time and energy
the item was how it was described and shipping was speedy it came in way before my classes even started awesom
it 's one of the best book i 've ever read or pages are all colorful and nice design very attracting the eye so we read more and interesting story inside and motivational i totally recommend this book if you are trying to pursue a better learning skills wether you are in school or you just want to learn to learning about it 's useful book for you
this book was required reading for my introduction to the freshman experience '' class and it is a must read for everyone ideas and concepts found in becoming a master student '' can be applied to every aspect of life the techniques found in this book were very helpful to me as a student an employee and as a person i highly recommend this book
whether it 's the war between bucky katt and fungo the ferret rob 's ongoing battle to maintain control of the household bucky 's quest to consume a monkey or satchel 's innocent view of the world there 's something everyone can enjoy and relate to in this little gem of a comic strip it is one of the most witty refreshing and downright funny stips to come along in a long time best of all this daily calendar provides me with a laugh almost every day if there 's any downside to it it 's that i do n't throw away the previous strips there are just too many good get fuzzy strips to justify getting rid of them if you 're limited on space at home or spend your day at the office in a veal cube like i do this would be the perfect addition to bring a little laughter to an otherwise mundane day i 'm just about through my 2006 calendar and have an order in for the 2007 version i need my daily quota of get fuzzy '' !
impact '' is a book my school has used for nearly a decade as an introduction to the short story literary issues and writing projects an excellent selection of 50 stories impact '' follows up each story with a discussion of some appropriate literary term a selection of questions that are actually worth answering as a teacher i know how bad these usually are and some really innovative writing topics the stories are all from shirley jackson 's charles '' to hemingway 's the old man at the bridge '' to arthur clarke 's who 's there '' most of the stories also hinge on some ironic twist allowing that most difficult and valuable of literary concepts to be taught thoroughly although a bit pricey for purchase just to read impact '' is also an excellent collection for anybody aspiring to write short stories they simply do n't get much better than these
during a very difficult stage in my life the lord led me to this book it is without a doubt one of my favourites i highly recommend it to everyone why well it teaches on lust and the reason we are sometimes tied to others in relationships that may sometimes not even be god 's will for our lives this is the first review i have ever written for any book i have read and i do read a lot and i am doing so because i truly feel that this book holds such vital information
i had originally purchased the printing of this book and gave many of them away the cover was different and oh how i wish i had it now ! this book is great ! i cant really add anymore than what others have added here but i can say please read this book everyone should have this information under their belts i would however recommend reading the beautiful side of evil like many they are unable to see the reality of satan 's plans to get us off into something that can be so destructive and even move us out of god 's truth see how this women was fooled into thinking something she was doing was from god and then how god reveals the truth to her much the same about garry 's book who by the way i have personally met the only difference between the 2 books is the story it tells
this book is great for people with a past '' it gives many examples of problems that have resulted from easily made mistakes it tells you how to avoid these mistakes yourself and how to build a foundation so these mistakes wo n't even come into play through the use of personal and experience as well as scripture greenwald teaches how to build a relationship with god and avoid and diminish relations with the devil absolutely amazing
this book offers invaluable insight to understanding soul ties and why it is imperative that they be broken it is a must read for people who are in relationships and still struggle with their attraction to their previous mates this book definitely sheds light on why the struggle exists and how to break the soul tie it is a personal favorite for me i recommend it to any single or married person
anyone at all interested in mexico should read this book this book is written in a style ala james mitchner it deals with a huge period of time starting before the time of the aztecs and moves through to modern times the author keeps it exciting and accurate he covers the highlights of mexico city and because of it 's governmental centralization the country of mexico itself without becoming overly bogged down in detail if you are a fan of historical novels this is a book you wo n't be able to put down
la capital tells an absorbing story by following the twists and turns of the history of mexico city the writing style is clear yet the author also gives a comprehensive history of the mexican capital of special note are the many anecdotes which provide much of the human interest for the reader my favourite was the story of irma serrena la tigresa '' a presidential mistress
un libro que se lee sin mayor dificultad gracias al lenguaje sencillo pero preciso y en esto radica la magia del autor que de ese modo nos motiva a continuar libre de tecnicismos antropolgicos o histricos esta obra es recomendable para todo aquel que desee enterarse sobre mxico con una visin clara veraz y hasta divertida
this is the definitive work on history of mexico city for the student of mexican history this is a well documented work for the casual reader it reads like a novel it should not be out of print
as a resident of mexico city who has studied its history la capital by jonathan kandell is the finest example of what a history book can be it reads like a mystery and the publisher should hang their head in shame that the book has not been reprinted i 'll run out today and buy whatever copies are left in mexico to give as gifts in the future
hofstadter tickles every curious and philosophical bone in your body this one is a long read with a lot of dense material if you take the time to get through it while understanding all of it this ai n't no dime novel ! you will find yourself sitting on such a mental high as you can not yet imagine plus you get to boast to all of your nerdy friends that you have read geb '' but thats just a perk
this is professor hofstadter 's thesis those thinking about reading this book should do some research before doing so since it is over 25 years old perhaps that will level set expectations so that you might objectively evaluate it 's merit and make an informed decision on whether or not it is a good investment for you individually but then that would be exercising exactly what this book is about put that in your pipe and smoke it ! if you are intrigued and fascinated by what it means to be human and have a mind if you are the type who wonders why or more importantly how do i wonder then you owe it to yourself to read this book even if like me you struggle to comprehend it and read it many many times until the light grows from a flicker to a full on fire you will appreciate your in the end this book absolutely stands on it 's own as an illuminating discourse on how the animate springs forth from the inanimate if you do n't like it put it down and read something you do enjoy but do n't take it personal and attack the author good bad or indifferent this book represents a monumental achievement for a brilliant human mind and that is irrefutable whether or not this is your '' is inconsequential we should all be thankful for people like professor hofstadter who dare to live without limits and take on the monumental effort of expanding the human collective consciousness
whenever i read a book in translation i often wonder if it 's the translator i love or hate or the author themselves literature in translation is essentially a complete of the book itself consider lewis carroll how does one go about translating seemingly endless word play and words that are often made up now consider the fact that alice in wonderland had been translated into over 50 languages if you could read all 50 languages some would approximate your understanding of alice '' and some would appear tangenital or worse dishonest to the original machine translation mt is considered ai 's hardest problem and hofstadter goes to painstaking length to show just why this is so despite marketing rhetoric he points out why such a solution is years in the making if it ever occurs at all to a satisfactory degree meaning literature not technical documents though many who have read escher bach '' or metamagical themas '' are sometimes disappointed in this book to me it is part of the evolution and being a word geek a polyglot and in the constant companion of one who makes translation a living i have to say this book rates above those other tombs on my list but be forewarned you are leaving the world of complex algorithms and entering a world where just such analysis is not forthcoming
i read this book in 1980 and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering against all i read before or have read since what stands out the most however is that my thinking changed after reading this book everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter which has quite simply changed my life perhaps a today would not have an equal effect in 1980 it was timely things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then the internet for instance but i 'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether escher bach an eternal golden braid is as eternal as the title claims for me the answer is a resounding yes i can say without doubt that my life would have been different if i had not read it at that time ok if it 's so great then what is it that makes it so trying to describe what is great about this book is like trying to say what is great about a particular bach fugue or an escher print a fugue does n't typically have a great melody the rhythm can be monotonous and predictable you know where it begins and where it will end up and the subjects will enter on cue and not deviate from their lines escher 's prints similarly are composed of mediocre representations of their subjects shading is not sublime some of the features may be grotesque what is it then that makes that fugue or that print great ahhh that 's the subject of this book and in beautifully crafted recursion its own principles apply equally to itself you will come away with an understanding of the underlying principles of intelligence beauty craft logic and universal principles of creation a deeper appreciation for those things does not necessarily mean a simpler or easier means of describing same in fact it may be the opposite sort of the more you know the more you know you do n't know '' this confrontation with and participation in the infinite seems to be the root of our longing a sense that bach escher and weaved intuitively into their own work without feeling compelled to explain so rather than expect to come away from this book with the answers to the big quiz of life i would say what one is more likely to find is a deepening of mu '' a rendering of knowledge into its proper place where answers '' in the western sense dissolve into the questions in a deepening spiral of association and metaphor to the point at which one sees so many possibilities that the original question loses its significance so is it nirvana not this book but one may get caught up in the craft of the author and his inspirations to the point that one might feel lifted up and deposited at the trailhead of a new path and the best that one can expect in this life is a new sublime path i think hofstadter would agree that nirvana should it exist is the path not the destination and this book may well prove the author to be a willing bodhisattva shooshi
this book is a great way to expose yourself to new ideas but in the words of a previous reviewer it was written by a passionate dilettante its treatment of godel 's proof is occasionally great but it is sometimes excessively obfuscatory and sometimes even just plain wrong i think this book is extremely clever and i encourage almost anyone to read it but take everything it says with a grain of salt it 's a great way to start yourself thinking about some fascinating things but do n't take the book too seriously if you want a real understanding of godel 's proof read godel 's proof '' by nagel and newman and then read a good translation of godel 's paper itself geb is clever and inspired but it should not be taken too seriously
plainly put this book was a ride standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking he digs into many different scientific mathematical and artistic disciplines and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing but ultimately satisfying whole the short dialogues that fit in between each chapter are clever and always but the bulk of this book 's worth comes in the chapters from the beginning to the end i constantly found myself having to stop and rethink my perspective on many subjects as the end of the book nears he wraps it up by theorizing profoundly on the subject of artificial intelligence while parts of this are dated by this point much of it is n't and that is a testament to hofstadter 's powerful intellect and foresight as you may have guessed from my review 's title this is not a summer beach read admittedly i am not the world 's fastest reader but this one took me a few months to complete i would often put it down for a stretch and pick it up again some time later so take your time with this one enjoy it reread passages you did n't understand the first time and maybe pick up a different easier book when you feel bogged down but for anyone with any interest in mathematics computer science or the philosophy of the human mind this is a and well worth all the time you can give it
i spent a good part of the day yesterday beggining a reading of geb and was fascinated at the way hofstadter looked at language and bach 's canons and fugues and there is much to come i can tell although i consider myself an intellectual i am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject but hope that hofstedter is going to open that up for me too
it 's the gifted individual who can make math fun it takes a complete master to do the same with godel 's theorem godel escher bach was first recommended to me by my piano accompanist three years ago i flipped through it it looked too bizarre and eclectic to bother with three years later when i finally did start reading it i could n't put it down hofstadter is entertaining fascinating earnest and above all unbelievably clever the puns littered throughout the meanings the symphonic weaving of the work is enchanting from start to finish i ca n't imagine anyone not gaining something from this book not seeing the world differently after it was finished logic seems different to me music different truth and math and reality different and there are moments of just the purest wonder within moments when i felt almost hyponotized ready to find out that i was a character within somebody else 's book maybe a djinn or a god over one i admit that even in this easily digestible presentation i could n't fully understand the godelian proof though i grokked the gist of it it 's no matter though there 's so much within here that i wo n't spell it out or explicate it only point out that it is what is claims to be a synthesis of the three titular men a work of gold
this book is a masterpiece for me it accompanied me throughout a long journey that i took in europe in the past it is written in a poetic way that makes you think reflect and enter into the fantastic world of the invisible cities of kublai khan 's empire created by calvino marco polo works for the khan he has to visit many towns of the mongolian empire so that later he can share his impressions with the great khan this is mainly because the empire is so big that kublai khan would never be able to visit all towns of his empire each chapter has the name of a town which is described by marco polo in addition there are many dialogs between kublai khan and marco polo that are in my point of view the most exciting part of the book the dialogs are so intelligent and stimulating that i read some of them many times they can trigger our natural curiosity about the way we see things around us the future the past the present etc it is a book to be read in a slow pace so we can reflect upon each part it helped me to slow down my frequently rushed rhythm of life how conscious are we while we write the pages of our lives
consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan calvino 's fiction is sui generis a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical if on a winter 's night a traveler '' this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination invisible cities '' is also i am convinced a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary of venice a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea
generally i like my books fast and with minimal description and at least plots lines while invisible cities is none of those things i would rate it among my favorite books the prose is incredible rich almost erotic at times i felt my heart beating faster as i read it this is a book to linger inside of to often to keep by your bedside to read snatches of before you go to sleep
this book has become my favorite equal to a few others but unsurpassed in its brilliance to me through its poignant insights fantastic imagery calvino 's exploration of his willingness to write in abstract terms and for lack of a better way of describing it the sunlight that beams from nearly every page of this book as others have written to describe or to try to describe the contents of this book quickly becomes irrelevant for calvino has opened doors through which city by city the reader not only visits but constructs cities of his own this book while short is nonetheless the only one i have read twice in a row could be it 's just my type of thing i do n't know if you 're a fan of science fiction fantasy or simply looking for a beautifully mysterious distraction put it in your cart check out and wait by your door
i read this decades ago when i was barely more than a child it is a brief volume i recall that i burned through the first 50 pages before i even realized what was going on then i had to start over from the beginning so that i could really begin to appreciate it this is a novel that fulfills all the usual requirements of a novel but just not in any of the usual ways of a novel there is poetry in it and ideas ideas that shed light on ideas and ideas that shed light on ideas and maybe on people but definitely on ideas if you want something different but not painful then this might be it but it wants to make you think as calvino usually does so it might seem a little bit boring or tedious until you make the effort to try to understand there 's trying and there 's succeeding all you have to do with this one is to try whether or not you succeed does n't matter if you just try you 'll have fun or at least that 's what i recall from decades ago when i still expected greatness in this world ymmv
immediately i can detect the luminous presence of magic in this slim volume although thin in pages it is deep in meaning without much in the way of characters or plot it sustains and enlightens laconic descriptions of fantastic cities woven together in a tapestry of voluminous nuance topics of memory perception vision time loss longing desire death signs symbols and ultimately meaning are all carefully chosen and arrayed upon finishing this book one has the feeling of have eaten a delicious meal too quickly that upon reflection it should have been savoured slowly
the writing is pure seduction whimsical enchanting all those words which mean totally freaking dreamy the problem is for me at least that it 's the sort of book that i ca n't read straight through it might take me a few weeks or a year probably because there is n't a plot to speak of anyway expect poetry get poetry and do n't let go of your copy because it 'll never come back mine didn't
i was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good to me the book was far from the brainless entertainment i was hoping for in fact invisible cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between marco polo and kublia khan at first i was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities through calvino 's use of symbolism i began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations this could have been the first time i really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams with all of the above said one problem i had when reading invisible cities was my mind seemed to easily drift off the page the book reads more like poetry then a novella and i felt that halfway through the book the form of the chapters became almost too redundant i think that if i were to the book and spend some time with it i could have gained greater insight into italo calinvo 's perspective and creative mind although i am not rushing to it anytime soon i would possibly read it again in the future
readers and fans of calvino 's invisible cities may be interested to know that an entire hotel has been on the theme of the book it is located on the balearic island of menorca in spain each room is based on a different 'invisible city ' i 've seen it it 's amazing no it 's overwhelming astonishing pictures are at
my brother picked this book up in an airport on the way to mexico with my family he was literally laughing out loud for days and relayed sotries to me and my dad i decided when he finished it i 'd give it a go though i was unsure about some of the author 's views on women but let me say in short that i as a 22 year old female loved the heck outta this book i picked up it one night and did n't put it down until i finished it in the wee hours of the morning i had never read a book all the way through in one sitting before and doubt i ever will again unless i pick this one up again i laughed so hard at times i almost peed my pants i was jealous of all the adventures tucker max had on top of his moderate success and kind of ticked that there was no way a woman could have such adventures let alone write an incredible book about it as many others pointed out it 's not a book that offers a grand awakening at the end giving you the warm and fuzzies but it will make you laugh and your friends will thank you for passing it on
for starters this book is a good read i rarely read and i knocked it out in a day and a half once you start reading it you wo n't be able to put it down you will talk about it with your friends and they will be clueless about what you are saying but you will not be able to stop so eventually they will want to read it and think you are the coolest guy ever for passing this book onto them if you like to party drink sleep with girls treat others with complete disrespect and basically live life to its fullest you will kill for this book have a good day and next time i see you you better be tucker max drunk yeah read it and find out what that is punk !
tucker max is going to hell i gladly followed reading his book brought laughs and the occasional brimstone scorch i have been lucky enought to have a friend like this and realize life is better than it could have ever been because of it
if you just want to be entertained and dont mind if not a single deep thought will pass through your read while you read then this book is perfect i thoroughly enjoyed everyone wishes they had a tucker max in their life cuz we 've got ta live vicariously through someone now we do and we can
yes i 'm an actual girl who purchased this book read it and laughed until i cried if you are n't easily offended and enjoy a good drunken story please buy the book
as a great fan of stand up and great comedy i felt it was needed of me to buy this book it was never any regrets about it this book had me lying on the floor laughing several times and is most lightly the best written piece of humor i have ever read i think this is a great book which everyone with a sence of humor should experience
great stories crazy and simple great lessons first book to have me laughing
this is a seriously funny book as long as you are the sorta person who laughs when a mate farts i laughed so hard that at one stage i had to stop reading the book because i had tears in my eyes
amazing story beautifully written it has all the elements of an exciting novel and it is true which makes it even more awesome
a persian friend gave me this book i could n't put it down so poetic and real as we live in times of war and devastation this book reminds us of the power of ideologies and politics it is about the turmoil of war and the price that innocent people pay so others can prosper and prove a point ! ! you feel the love of a country and the sadness losing that land the uprooting of your beliefs in the voice of roya her description is so vivid and sentimental i am not sure if her suffering pertains to one sect or race i think she meant to portray the universal downfall of humanity and the blindness of extreme
reading roya 's accounting of her ordeal gives one a profound feeling of the reality of the time it is amazing that roya 's experience had such an effect on her that the details still remain intact for her reproduce such an amazing book
laugh cry remember and connect to home ! roya makes you do all that especially if you grew up in iran the beginning of the revolution enjoy and pass it along to all the women in your family
roya hakakian comes from a secular jewish family who identifies with iran the family is integrated into iranian life and roya looks forward to the wonderful changes that will come with the revolution this is the story about the changes that came to the ordinary people of iran the dying of hope the hopelessness of change the story covers the lives of the hakakian family singled out for being jewish and the lives of the moslem and jewish families they know and who are their friends this is not a happy story it brings down to the indiviual level the failure of the islamic revolution in iran
the somber cover the title and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading this memoir is not especially dark or grim and the journey it recounts is an internal one more from the land of yes '' than no '' it captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times and the islamic revolution in iran becomes the worst of times for the community of jews living in tehran in the late as the monarchy is toppled and the ayatollah khomeini returns from exile to assume power hakakian 's book is a vividly and wonderfully remembered account of her coming of age in these tumultuous years the equally gifted younger sister of three precocious brothers an admitted class clown '' she happily plays her own growing and against the reader 's knowledge of coming events through her we experience the almost universal public euphoria that followed the fall of the shah and while she chooses to discount its significance we see mounting evidence of the approaching political and social forces that will finally drive her family to join the jewish exodus from iran this is a fine book often entertaining and sometimes starkly moving the parallels hakakian draws to orwell 's 1984 '' illustrate the gradual erosion of self that occurs when the state attempts to control individuals ' thoughts and desires in this and other ways it 's an excellent companion to nafisi 's reading lolita in tehran
i used this memoir as one of three core texts for an intensive summer course and my students loved it it is beautifully written poetic and very honest i lived in iran from 1983 to 1993 and i believe this is the most accurate memoir of life in iran that i have read
this beautifully written book explores the iranian revolution from the perspective of a young jewish girl hakakian is a delicious writer and her description of pre and iran is vivid and stimulating as a frequent reader of this genre i found this book to be far and away the best in its category and highly recommend it to anyone interested in iran and the country 's current imbroglio women 's studies or judaism
this is a beautifully written book that makes you feel like you are in iran at the time of the revolution hakakian 's prose brings to life the sounds smells and feel of life in revolutionary iran through the eyes of a young girl not only is it an enjoyable book to read but educational as well especially for americans whose view of these times was tinted by the media offering us a singular view of iran hakakian offers a beautiful mosaic of her life in iran and the emotions of becoming a stranger in your own land read it and enjoy
a nice simple good night book with no bells and whistles to get the kids active again at bedtime recommend highly
this was a favorite of my daughter 's and she 's 42 now ! while she loved all the margaret wise brown books as they came out this always remained the favorite it must be in the genes because the two oldest grandchildren now out of college loved it the best too and now the third grandchild a is reading it to herself at night ! oddly while one can find good night moon '' in any book store a child 's goodnight book '' is never there until amazon i always had to order it from the publisher we include it in the presents we give to all the youngsters we know and always get rave reviews from the new parents i think i 've ordered at least two dozen copies from amazon since you all came along thanks
three generations of our family have used this book at bedtime and our current copy is taped together ! a soothing rhythmic book that talks about pussycats kangeroos wild things in the forest sailboats and engines all getting quiet and sleepy my grandson saves it as the last book to read and he falls asleep by the time we finish the little prayer at the end a very special book indeed
i used this book 10 years ago when i first began my career and i still refer to it today it demonstrates the ability to direct kids in the correct manner while they develop their and their independence it gives you ways to deal with negative situtations that allows the child to walk away feeling like they can be a better person and they will be ! kari koffma
the book povides suggestions and solutions for today 's classrooms it is also a good book to use as a quick reference for those disciplinary topics you may need very good
i recently as you like it prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival 's performance of this play under the summer stars here in boulder shakespeare produced this romantic comedy in 1599 and published it in the first folio in 1623. summarizing the play is rather challenging it basically tells the story of duke frederick who has banished his brother duke senior into the forest of arden thereby usurping the kingdom in his exile duke senior has found a humble life of merriment with his court following a wrestling match duke frederick also banishes orlando son of the late sir roland de boys and rosalind daughter of duke senior into the forest at the match the two have fallen into love at first sight out of friendhip duke frederick 's only child celia and the court jester touchstone follow rosalind now disguised as a boy ganymede '' into the forest soon orlando rosalind celia and touchstone are all welcomed into the merry life of banished duke senior orlando however is lovesick for rosalind and rosalind still disguised as a boy decides to cure orlando of his lovesickness while counseling him in the ways of true love rosalind disguised as ganymede finds herself falling deeper in love with orlando meanwhile celia has fallen in love with orlando 's brother oliver the two decide to get married the next day even witty touchstone has fallen in love with a goatherd girl audrey in the final scene and after many hilarious mixups all romantic entanglements are resolved by marriage and after a sudden religious conversion duke frederick returns the throne to his brother thereby righting all wrongs and uniting all couples by love and happiness merritt
as far as shakesepare 's comedies go the comedy of errors '' will always be my favorite and while this as you like it '' never quite obtained the popularity of a midsummer night 's dream '' or the taming of the shrew '' one probably could argue that as you like it '' is the best of shakespeare 's comedies this play contains several plots that shakespeare cleverly intertwines and it offers a happy ending with love triumphant but more important than the triumph of love the theme of reconciliation carries through to virtually everyone in the story the story begins with the sibling rivalry of orlando and his older brother oliver who has hoarded the family inheritence after a brief fight oliver hopes that orlando may accidentally die in a wrestling match against charles this is where a plot comes in the duke frederick who has a daughter celia has banished his older brother the true duke who has a daughter rosalind but for now rosalind is allowed to stay and she has made good friends with celia orlando meets these 2 girls and falls into favor with rosalind after the wrestling match things start to go bad orlando learns that his brother oliver is planning to kill him and rosalind is banished but all is not lost orlando takes his loyal servant adam and flees while rosalind in the male disguise of ganymede along with celia and the comical touchstone will flee to look for rosalind 's father and here is where the play becomes mostly comical good comedies can often have a sad start the comedy of errors '' shows this well moving on we meet rosalind 's father and his crew who have made exile into a paradise from duke sr 's party we meet the melancholy jaques but he is arguably the most interesting character in the story in fact the most famous passage from this play belongs to jaques the 7 stages of man which end in nothing perhaps macbeth took lessons from jaques 'tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow ' duke sr welcomes orlando and adam and it is n't long before orlando and rosalind run into each other shakespeare maintains the comedy when rosalinde keeps her male disguise on and tells orlando he must practice wooing on touchstone has some comical romantic moments with audrey and there is an interesting triangle where the shepherd silvius loves phebe but phebe loves rosalinde seeing only ganymede ! we may recall this from the night '' when olivia loved viola in her male disguise but after this comical moment all begins to resolve oliver comes on the scene and he and celia fall in love so much so that oliver is willing to reconcile with orlando and grant him all the play ends with not only the reunion of rosalind and her father but the joyous weddings of rosalind orlando celia audrey and phebe silvius but more good news comes celia 's father mends his ways and returns all to rosalind 's father jaques offers the crowning touch despite his cynical nature he is not a villain ironically this hermit type man converses with more characters than anyone in the story and while he can not take part in the play 's final happiness he does wish everyone well as i said my favorite comedy will always be the comedy of errors '' but do n't make the mistake of overlooking this comedy
as with all of shakespeare the concept of love at first sight is given far too much credit but other than that this is a delightful romp filled with much amusement the language is as beautiful as one expects in shakespeare but is somewhat less difficult for the modern reader to follow than in some of his plays i found myself being more distracted than helped by most of the footnotes as with most shakespearean comedies it was easy to see that this play was intended for the amusement of the common people the similarities in style between the plot here and in much modern pop culture were striking the sexual innuendo to be had when a woman passes for a man and finds another woman falling in love with her for instance if it had a flaw it was that the ending was just a little too pat and contrived even for a comedy but that 's just a minor quibble
whew this story has an even faster plot turn about than austen 's pride and prejudice if one is not careful you like me may suffer plausibility whiplash '' that said as you like it is a delightful example of shakespearean comedy jaques is one of my favorites from shakespeare 's stable of characters things get renewed folks get married fortunes are restored good stuff i must also mention how much i like these signet classic shakespeare texts they are darn fine good intros critical pieces and source info and dirt cheap
this book was one of my best loved shakespeare 's plays it really gave me comfort and laugh whenever i read it i hope in real lifre i can find a forest like the one in the play so i can hide my self there and live as i like it '' rosaind is the best female character in the literature for her sense of humour and intelligence and passion orlando reminds all those who ever loved of their first love the bittersweet and compelling passion that one is not capable of getting rid of if you had spare time you really should read this play i guarantee the language in this play is not that hard and you will find yourself so into this fantastic tale once you started reading it
as you like it '' is bar none one of shakespeare 's very best works it is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work along with the equally or even more brilliant midsummer night 's dream '' is the best example of shakespeare 's theme of the dream world '' the real '' world this play especially the scenes in the forest is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination it consequently can be read as a criticism of the real world '' here represented by duke ferdinand 's court like many of the other comedies shakespeare is mocking the ideal '' which many in his society would have praised though this play deals with some pretty dark themes which of his plays does n't it is a and fully enjoyable read
adrei makine 's book dreams of my russian summer 's is a very special book even though the author wrote the book in french and i read it in translation english the writing is fantastic it takes a little getting used to it it 's very flowery '' just to give you fair warning but once you get used to it you 'll appreciate it and despite all the attention given to the language quite a bit actually happens the dialogue does n't stand still it 's a moving and interesting story the story is told in retrospect in the first person it 's a memory we are told that he has a grandmother who has both french and russian backgrounds born and raised in france and married a russian and lived out the rest of her life there making her way through world wars and quirky russian society what we 're not told immediately is why the narrator is fixated on his grandmother 's dual nationality which is what the novel is about take time to enjoy the language and to fully appreciate the details of the story i immediately reread the first 20 pages upon finishing just to make sure i did n't miss anything important this 1995 book will definitely be read and reread for a long time
a work of art makine 's use of language is stunning not a quick read i frequently had to stop and ponder many profound passages literature as an art form is not dead
i read that book in french le testament franais so it may be possible that the english translation is n't as good as the french one i found that book so wonderful and the progression of the boy from childhood to adulthood is so well described the images that makine creates are beautiful and you can clearly see them it 's an excellent book for the ones who like to think and to dream
time alters all things the resultant changes can be decay or or at the opposite end of the spectrum the changes can be enhancing as a patina on fine wood andrei makine 's dreams of my russian summers has happily acquired a literary patina that makes this brief but crystalline memoir of childhood even more of a joy to read after a few years on the shelf makine has the rare ability to weave wholly credible stories with unforgetable characters while at the same time measuring his prose like poetry we are to suppose this is an autobiography but it is far more than the journey of a nascent writer becoming a man this is the essence of the russian mind embellished by the great fortune of having early exposure to the beauty of france by means of recalling summers with charlotte a french born grandmother who nourishes the imagination and history of the writer to the point of delirium all that has happened to and in russia from the time of the tsars to the present is presented in such a way that the grisly realities are always balanced by the homage to love of fatherland makine is a stunning writer and is still adding to our contemporary literature in ways that secure him a place among the geniuses of the word read and indulge your mind and your senses
i 've loved this book since a business english class where it was a requirement it makes it so easy to find your topic i no longer work in an office but whenever i have personal correspondence that needs to be perfect '' i find myself still reaching for this little gem
if you are looking for a great informative handbook to keep available at your desk in the office i recommend how 9 handbook this is by far an excellent handbook to have how 9 handbook gives you information on grammar usage memos reports and business documents the numbers listed on the front of the book helps in finding the material you need easily clark clark hit a home run with this book also if you need a little refresher course to enhance your skills i recommend the how 9 workbook try them both for yourself ! ! every office worker should have one
this book was required reading for a college course however had i found the book on my own i would have felt i struck gold ! how 9 is the tool to keep right on your desk allowing you to either learn or refresh skills from grammer and punctuation to proper format of an email correspondence or business letter
this book has the fundamental of indexing and why we should consider it as part of building our financial portfolio bogle is at his best preaching the value of indexing and how it relates to lower cost investing this eventually translates to higher return for the investors and less profit to the brokerage firms that make money on trading the book is a valuable resource for beginners who have not build their investment portfolio using actively managed funds i found it helpful in thinking about how to think about reducing the number of funds in my portfolio one point that i thought bogle went too far when he displayed little enthusiasm about investing in international funds i believe that this is a must giving the fact that our politicians are not taking care of our macro economy by taking big gambles around the world the motto of staying the course no matter what happens is very true i saw that real time during the economic downturn after the year 2000. staying the course paid off really well now that we are out of that trough !
bogle the founder of the vanguard group does an excellent job explaining the value of indexing and shows historical and relative information that bases his knowledge on facts a great book for any investor both new and experienced that will help make your investment strategy more intelligent and educated especially if you believe that it 's almost impossible to beat the market on your own the book can be difficult to read at times so make sure your energy level is high before you indulge
bogle bob brinker and jane bryant quinn sold me on the idea of index funds there are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to as one money manager told me be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute '' hogwash especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds only you pay the higher expense ratios i 've done very well with index funds covering the s p 500 as well as the european and pacific markets i 'm just now breaking into the index fund 's conceptual spawn the etf one complaint the book is indeed repetitive the major selling points expense ratios tax efficiency market allocations etc could have been stated as well with half the text it 's also a somewhat tedious read but still worthwhile i 'm a cfp in training
although a good resource book about the benefits of mutual fund investing i found the title to be a bit misleading being the self proclaimed creator of index funds bogle cites many years of comparative returns from mutual funds while making the case that over the long run investing in index funds will produce the highest returns i think a more apt title might be why index funds beat all ''
we believe that this classic work by one of the twentieth century 's great investment authorities belongs on every investor 's bookshelf published in 1999 at the height of a notorious stock market bubble it was a rare sage appraisal of investment reality it remains relevant author john bogle argues so strenuously for a passive investment approach based on index funds that you could almost accuse him of marketing hype after all he did start vanguard an investment company best known for its index funds however the evidence he presents to back up everything he says exonerates him fully today 's investors are not quite as eager as investors were in the to believe in the impossible dream of infinite wealth from the stock market still many people waste their time and money trying to beat a market that the best financial research unequivocally shows is for most people and over the long run unbeatable bogle explains why while recommending reform of the mutual fund industry
everybody knows that asset allocation is the only significant factor in portfolio performance right well no bogle starts with the jahnke research article the hoax of asset allocation '' and piles on mountains of his own research to demonstrate beyond doubt that cost is what really matters in every asset class imaginable that being the case indexing is the only rational investment strategy because index funds and these days index etfs have by far the lowest costs this edition was written before the crash the revised edition will make for fascinating reading which views have changed which have been reinforced it 's a little hard to know who bogle 's intended audience is the analysis is too deep for casual i might even say that you need to share his enthusiastic obsession to get through it all plus he is so intent on proving how important cost is that he gives such matters as diversification virtually no attention except to say that it 's a good thing unless you agree with the implication that you should simply buy vanguard 's balanced index fund vbinx and be done with it you will need to look elsewhere for advice on matters other than cost bogle devotes the last third of the book to a discussion of how the fund industry should restructure itself to better serve the investor since it obviously wo n't ever happen that sheep will not get shorn it 's rather sad and quixotic in fact considering the sad state of affairs at once a bastion of customer service now gone to hell for the sake of corporate profits it 's worrisome to consider whether vanguard will go down that same road once the old man is safely out of the picture the end of the book is a brief autobiography of his creation vanguard and the index fund that rocked the world i think bogle is the best an inspiring example for the ages who created the opportunity for individual investors to succeed i come to his book with that bias and i slogged through it all because of my admiration not everyone will be sufficiently motivated to put in the effort however even though they would be rewarded for it if they did
an eye opener for all mutual fund investors bogle 's logical arguments are backed by historical data and thorough analysis a must read
i saw the review by warren buffett and some other investing stars on the cover and that was good enough for me to check it out i was n't disappointed the concepts are simple but they take some mental work and patience to digest but you will be rewarded if you do n't have the time or inclination to invest the hundreds of hours required to successfully invest long term in individual stocks then funds are an alternative if you know what you 're doing first invest in increasing your value in a field for which you have a passion when enough excess cash starts flowing above what you need for a comfortable not extravagant lifestyle invest time in understanding bogle 's concepts for relatively safely compounding money over time
it could also be titled '' how professors of finance invest and how warren buffet thinks everyone should invest '' that is unless you actually are as good as warren buffet then a different strategy may be more appropriate for you
quick read that 's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children and how that impacts the adult lives of those children iles has quickly become a favorite author of mine with turning angel being the first book i read and this being the second i look forward to reading his other works
if you 're interested in forensics chances are you 'll like this book the book also manages to tie in sexual abuse repressed memories vietnam ptsd and a little romance it even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long i was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book 's plot and discussions as intricate as they are
based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes iles is a better writer than grisham i picked up this book i do n't know if iles can outwrite grisham but he is definitely a contender i found blood memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists but it is on the grim side the main character pursues solving two mysteries one a serial killer on the loose and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie in the end the two mysteries are related though i think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen as an aside i remain amazed and impressed that iles can so effectively write a novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of sexual abuse not a five star but a solid four
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
this was a very good book i just kept turning the pages this is the first i have read by this author and i was very impressed after about the first 100 pages it really takes off i am glad a friend loaned it to me to bad it tok me over a year before i opened it
i guess it 's high praise for iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child drinking valium baths in scalding water this was a thoroughly gripping book that at 764 pages long i was sad to see come to an end greg iles does n't shy from the sensitive subject of pedophilia and tackles it with unflinching honesty there is no way to guess the nomurs bad guy '' in this book til the very end i do n't care what the australian said who apparently solved the mystery in the first chapter but i 'm disappointed that the author did not interweave the natchez and new orleans crimes better it does get repetitive like some said but i still highly recommend this book if you 're looking for a taut atmospheric suspense mystery very and fresh
one of the boldest of the bold kudos to iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists nambla has been put on notice this is work of pure satisfaction from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero cat another worthy pile of words from iles despite his ignorance regarding black people the dialog is downright embarrassing but keep trying iles if you hang out with rather than watch them on tv perhaps you 'll get 5 stars next time
this is the first book i 've read by greg iles however it will not be the last ! this book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues after reading this book i better understand my mother who was sexually abused and her response to my sexual abuse she was able to sheild me from parental sexual abuse but not from my then boyfriend i found it very helpful that iles gave contact numbers and information at the end of the book regarding sexual abuse this book will help you to see the signs of abuse if you like cat ferry are willing and able to open your mind to the truth of what you witness
as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse i found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person this book will stick with me a long time and i hope even though it is long readers will give it the chance it deserves i thought this work by iles to be very insightful
this is romance in the classical tradition intelligent witty mysterious and haunting i first read the book five years ago and have it several times since it is a pure pleasure to read for the beauty of the prose alone add to that the delights of some very interesting characters and descriptive passages that remain haunting long after the book is finished and you have a novel worthy of being called a romance '' i have been discouraged in recent years by the which seems pithy and silly when compared to the great romantic traditions byatt includes a quote from nathaniel hawthorne in the beginning of her book about the nature of the romance and novel i personally am grateful to writers of byatt 's talents who want to reclaim the romance novel to a work of such quality ! hawthorne and melville and cooper would be thrilled
fabulous sumptuous and superb this is one complex twisted book that is also fascinating and intensely readable i often start reading books of this genre with a sense of trepidation because however good they are they 're also so often dense and with the vividness of the characters and plot bogged down in the author 's strivings for depth with the result that the reader is always kept at a distance struggling like a drowning man to feel empathy for the characters and to actually want to continue reading this book is flows along with an unselfconscious and almost effortless ease establishing the characters as empathetic human people in our minds and moving the plot along without unnecessary jargon while at the same time layering it with a rich tapestry of words details and emotions so that the past and the present pictured in the novel weave together and reflect on each other i was stunned and carried along by the ease with which one sentence flows into the next and riveted by the characters and the passion of the world i found myself in once in a long while i find a book in which i can actually feel my brain expanding at the depth and stunning simplicity of the author 's vision this is one of it it 's passionate and lyrical rich and wonderful
not the type of books i usually read poetry and all and it took me quite a while to get into it '' but it was worth it the story is and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written highly recommended
i was very pleased with the quality of this dvd and the relatively quick delivery nice job
before there was the davinci code there was a story of two intrepid researchers fighting against time and exposure to find the truth that comparision out of the way possession is a highly literary novel that deals with the reality of the cults '' surrounding famous literary figures and the idea of what would happen if one day some researcher stumbled on a scandalous past that was not in all of the major studies of their patron '' author i loved this book i agree with the other reviewers in that this book is hard to get into at first after putting it down several years ago i came back to it read the first 150 pages and then promptly took a vacation from it and then finished it in several consecutive sittings i say hard to get into with all seriousness but it is the hard to get into that one finds when reading classic literature like jane eyre or daisy miller believe me i have advanced degrees in english and english studies but even for me it was hard to get used to the book however the payoff is very high and the characters are very engaging this is a work that one can easily write many papers and do much analysis with it is and involves many levels but is this not what literature asks us to do anyway
this book is fiercely intelligent playfully readable uncompromisingly intellectual technically dazzling and more byatt succedes in being able to so deftly straddle that boundary between writing a good book and making great literature that it almost makes me feel sorry for most other writers the language snaps the story strides confidently along the characters develop in such a way that they seem to bloom organically rather than to be creations of a mind and the plot has just enough twists turns and surprises to make it an unlikely extra praise should be lain for byatt 's ability to perfectly summon victorian poetic and epistolic forms and make them unite seamlessly with the book 's wider postmodernist tone and philosophy of course no book is without its faults and this one probably has more than i would like to admit but generally i found this to be an amazing book that i would recommend without hesitation
i read this book when it first came out and read it again last month the passion between the lines in this wonderfully conceived and crafted book of both prose and poetry had me totally possessed and engrossed in the multiple and simultaneous stories i like the aspect of the and how the stories of the past intertwine within the story of the present in a magical and surreal fashion at times this is the stuff that passion is made of and byatt has outdone herself in this masterpiece possession was a book i became wrapped up in within the literary creativity the historical factors and the beautiful poetry and prose the novel took me back to a time period i could visualize and had my senses alert and eager to continue possession passion poetry and prose all combined in one artful and magnificent novel
what is it about this book that transforms one into a hauntingly romantic magical place like no other some pages were rather tedious that i had to skip them but still a very unique and unforgettable read i was thinking of giving 5 stars but felt that the writer was stilted and failed to be convincing as to the depths of feeling in the two main relationships hence the 4 stars
possession is quite simply one of the finest most engrossing books i have ever read
this is a wonderful story that everyman 's library has place in great binding
reading is n't usually something i choose to do in my spare time my daughter was reading this for school so i decided to read it too because of her reaction to it this is not your every day novel ! the more i read it the madder i got i could n't read it for an extended amount of time because i would become too angry to continue but then i had to pick it up again to find out what happened this book is a pure emotional ride i love it
great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author charles dickens the main character pip grow up in the home of a blacksmith with both of his parents dead he lives with his older sister and her husband named joe pip soon meets miss havisham and the beautiful estella that live wish her pip hoped that miss havisham intentions were to make his fortune make him a gentleman and have estella to he was wrong because the social class division leaves pip a worker and estella was a lady after disappointment pip hears news that a secrete benefactor want to make pip a gentleman and give him a fortune and informs him that he is a man of great expectation pip has no idea of who is benefactor is but heads to london to start his eventful life as a gentleman even if pip work hard for his life but he is getting on well finally it is a very powerful book that connects with people s live all over great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes the character and the writing themes in this book are very important they can easily relate to us today the main point of the book is affection loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class wealth the character of pip made me feel quit e sad he had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally there are many character of this book that also made this book very interesting follow
this was an interesting book it is the first book by charles dickens that i had ever read the language was weird but that was because it was a british novel written in a different era i enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time i plan on reading several other works by this author it was slow to start but only because i was not used to the writing style or language i would recommend
this book sucks very badly ! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place ! !
charles dickens ' novel great expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels in the united states in the century people would rather read about plots where all turns out well for the protagonists dickens however chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of betrayal duplicity unfaithfulness and a handful of other negative characteristics definitely an interesting novel great expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering i would highly recommend this masterpiece
this is an adorable love movie for anyone it 's witty humor and charming story combine into making it the perfect ! it 's great for watching any time or even when you 're feeling blue ! it 's sure to lift the spirits ! ! !

i have seen this movie several times and i still like it each time i review this movie i can gain different thinking you 'll love it if you have it
oh this was a really cute book i do n't really understand the '' disappointing '' reviews that other people are leaving it was light fun and cute it also gave great insight into the parties that we read about in the magazines do n't listen to the it was cute and fun to read
i never read tdwp or any romance novel for that matter but thought i might get a glimpse into the romantic expectations of women as revealed in a modern chick lit book this is a lighthearted tale not meant to rival the collective works of dickens and any attempt to critique it as otherwise is really silly i do think lauren weisberger is a genius in reflecting the desires of young women looking for romance lifestyle and good friends i live in nyc and i am surprised when meeting girls in other parts of the country who ask me about how glamorous the clubs are and what celebrities i encounter the author knows this and chooses that the main character bette works for a pr firm ensuring easy access to the beautiful and popular including philip weston whose princely background and looks elevate bette 's social standing yet do n't compensate for his arrogance drunkeness and something else you can read the novel to find out about the strong silent bouncer she falls for can not only protect her physically but has a sensitive side too being a chef and turns out to be none other than the boy next door her true friends whom she blows off while on the party circuit forgive her and throw her an intimate warm not extravagant party in the end all the while bette 's angelic uncle faithfully pulls strings and supports her at every turn there 's even a nasty girl jealous of bette for readers to hate i can see how many girls would love the mentioning of fashion brands celebrity names hip places and cool new technology but i ca n't yet figure out if lauren is poking fun at people who own blackberries or if she 's helping to market them therefore you whoever you are and wherever you 're reading about this fabulous event must own one a blackberry so that you too may be young hip urban and cool '' 217 sure bette is but most of us at least occasionally wallow in misery when our expectations fall short of our real lives then escape that with picturing ourselves as the center of attention lauren weisberger capitalizes on this very real sentiment
ok yes this is n't the next great american novel however this book is a great to read when you 're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the nyc social scene similar yes to the devils wears prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book a worthy read for all fans of chick lit but if hawthorne is your favorite writer you may want to pass
i have not read the devil wears prada but i have seen the movie i found this second book to be basically the same as the devil wears prada with just a slightly different scenario i would like to see something a little more original from this author because i truly enjoy her writing style
i really enjoyed this book so much that i lent it to my mom an avid romance reader i love the book club idea i would totally do that i enjoyed this book much more than the first one the whole thing with the boss was n't all negative just there was the problem of having a boss near your age and should you be friends or not and the idea of having your dream job '' that is more of a nightmare was really great too in all it was what i needed a fun read for a long airplane flight
i simply adore this book and it 's what made me go out to buy every other nora roberts novel it just amazes me the chemistry between luke and roxanne everytime i read it i ca n't get over the excitement and the smile it brings to me as they barb back and forth it 's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops roxanne is smart and sassy and luke is just too cool this romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me my very favorite romance
magic mystery romance and burglary are all part of this extremely captivating adventure i fell in love with the characters immediately even knowing they were good '' thieves hence honest illusions '' the book begins with luke callahan coming back into roxanne nouvelle 's life after a 5 year absence and then immediately flashes back to the time approximately 10 years previous when roxy was 8 and luke 12 when luke joined the carnival nouvelle his daughter roxy lily mouse and their right hand caretaker back in new orleans leclerc the flashback continues throughout more than half of the book setting up the reader for the background information needed to tell the full story i felt it was necessary and definitely kept the reader interested to go back to the beginning unlike some of the reviewers who felt the flashback was too long the book then picks up to the current time but to me the continuity of the story completely hinged on the background information since i do n't want to give any of the plot away i will end my review right here this is a story that i would definitely and hated to see end a sure fire plot for an excellent movie
i read the review and got the book and fell in love with it i think nora is a great writer i have read other of noras book but i like this one the most i would definatly recomend it !
it is difficult to find books in this genre that have a new flare to them usually the story lines are similiar as well as the characters this had some of that but the magical part of it made for a new twist to the average story line it takes a little bit of reading to really get into the book though the beginning catches your attention but then it quickly jumps back in the past and you have to learn about how the characters grew up together and fought until they reached adulthood that part of it is a bit slow by the time they do grow up it gets much more interesting and even touches the heart strings a bit not my favorite by nora roberts but it was alright as a contemporary romance
this is one of my favorite nora roberts book i have read it several times luke is a great hero even if he is a thief and i just fell in love with him
this book has everything greed murder what more can you ask for this book was one of the first romance novels i ever read and i still have my original copy that belonged to my mother i love to read it over and over again luke and roxy are two of my favorite characters usually the background characters tend to fade but those in this book max mouse lily and even mike the dog are all memorable
when i began to read nora roberts i really did n't expect to be drawn into her novels the way every one said i would be boy was i wrong ! this is an original story i 've never read a romance that was this intricate and well written spanning years from childhood to adulthood max and roxanne fight their love for each other max because of the slight age difference roxanne because she is too proud to tell him the setting is a lot of locales but new orleans is the main place that the story is set in any story that is set in new orleans is sure to be full of superstition passion and culture nora does n't dissapoint with this novel definately one of a kind
what can i say about a book like this that has n't already been said it 's a tremendous piece of work and a great help it 's 5 stars worth of information
this is the indispensible book when seeking a literary agent
if you have what it takes to publish you write well and are writing something saleable then this book will help you learn the steps you should take to get an agent and publisher read and take the advice his book offers as the information is as valauable as gold for those wanting to make money getting published as a first time writer i have found success by reading and acting on this information it happened more quickly than i would have expected do n't let other reviews dampen your spirits to write and publish i you want to get published you need this book
i think kiyosaki became indeed rich with his rich dad poor dad '' series and rightly so however this particular book is just repeating of the same ideas i have seen in his other books with not much new information related to investing as the title suggested in any case i do recommend reading the original title rich dad poor dad what the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not ! ''
motivational and inspiring this book is a rich dad classic offering investment advice specifically on taking advantage of current assets problem does n't tell you how to gain assets other suggested titles to supplement this 097883460
this is a great overview that has helped me personally and when explaining real estate investments to my clients information is absolutely power in this case
kiyosaki 's third book in his rich dad poor dad series delivers again this book is a logical progression of rdpd and cfq building on his principals of building wealth for the first half of the book afterwards kiyosaki unveals what the reader has been waiting for just how the rich invest he disclaims the book plainly for the reader looking for the next hot stock tip or get rich quick scheme the book delivers on it 's title from a principal information standpoint which should suit readers that realize that wealth is built up over time and based upon timeless principals and a strong foundation the last two phases of the book are extremely kiyosaki covers financial ratios ipo offerings taking companies public and of course real estate principals he presents his information to get you thinking not to give you answers for he knows the answers will come if the action is initiated another aspect of kiyosaki that i particularly like is that he discusses his failures which should let the masses know that riches are often found after many failures more often it is the norm so if you want easy answers do n't buy this book if you want principals ingredients for success in building wealth and systematic structure on what you should be thinking in acquiring and keeping your wealth this is your book !
excellent book truly a must rea
some have reviewed this book as a more of the same '' from kiyosaki more of what you can find in rdpd but for me it 's first of all the best of all kiyosaki 's books always remembering that is best to read the first two before though not estrictly necessary but the main issue here the nice thing about kiyosaki is that more than simple concepts is that he helps you change your mind where all poverty or richness reside after all so the more you read no matter if it may seem repetitive the more insights you get kiyosaki is full of lessons lessons that are easy to read and understand but maybe hard to appropiate into one 's personal life everyday i personally have started reading the bokk fir the second time and i discovered that many of the concepts i read the first time had n't got me or taken me as they have now for me not only a must read a book to study
this book is for changing your mind set on investing it does not give specific advice in what stocks to by or where to buy real estate etc it is like kiyosaki 's other books in changing the readers mind set on how money works he trys to teach in this book how it is not neccesary to have money to make money ideas are more powerful than best investment is fulfilling a need that people have through a business you have to be willing to pay the price to make your plan actually think this book is better than your run of the mill investment books because he goes into great detail on every kind of investment you can imagine at 43 chapters it is a lot of information to take in i do not think it is as good as his other books but is a good investment of time on your journey of financial independance
i just read a small excerpt of this book which i read in its entirety many years ago i found the writing especially lively and interesting i also visited in italy some months ago and have my impressions of that time to compare with what barzini says i also might add that i grew up in a neighborhood in troy new york where we had many siciliano neighbors who were our enemies at time but mostly our friends i also have a deep and sympathetic relation to the vast creative capacity of the italian people throughout the generations both in visual arts and in music and i am aware too of the historical role sunny italy played for those lost in the cold north who dreamed of new life goethelike in the land of the south i too know that one of the oldest jewish communities in the world is the community of rome which as i recently saw is sadly depleted and has not recovered from the terrible deportations in the time of the nazis all this as prelude to saying that barzini does not give a comprehensive description of italian character but rather a series of essays which show to the reader aspects of italian life the italians lively energetic clinging to their own homes and ways so closely so richly musical so passionate in their enjoyment in life seemed at one time to set a standard for how human beings should live i do not know how much of this book is dated and how much italy today is simply a depleted demographically dying aging and tired society in our recent visit to italy though i felt a strong sense of the beauty of the place and the beauty of people
i heard of this book 40 years ago when a tv version won an emmy award i was inspired to read it after my most recent trip to italy growing up as an i wondered why my people acted the way they do and this book provides valuable insight barzini graduated from columbia and it shows in his command of the english language this book is a classic but like most classics it 's old so while much of it is timeless other parts are out of date both culturally and politically however if one wants to gain a grounding in the italian culture this book is a very good place to start
a classic book and you can hardly add anything to it though a little dated still worth reading
first i would compliment jim paris ' intelligent review paris leaves me little to add what barzini did not foresee was the radical changes the last forty years would have on italian culture divorce would never be acceptable to the italian people writes barzini confidentally yet only a few years after this book came out divorce was legalized in italy barzini must have really be perplexed when the next level of cultural degeneration was abortion rights writing in the italy of barzini must not have thought the concept of abortion would ever be a part of italian life yet abortion became commonplace in italy within barzini 's lifetime he must of felt a foreigner in his own land that he so much loved
wherever jack reacher goes trouble seems to follow he ca n't even have a quiet cup of coffee without a crime taking place in front of him this is the book in the reacher series and they seem to be getting better and better ca n't wait for the next one to come out
this is must reading for thriller addincts '' child at this best
the hard way '' was a wonderful adventure to listen to the audio version was beautifully produced and the reading was the best i have listened to karl arnd
i 'm not sure why this character is so engaging but he is there are only a few authors whose books i buy in hardback rather than waiting for the soft cover but lee childs is one i would n't call this his very best reacher novel but as always it 's interesting intense and a great way to pass an evening or two
traveling do gooder jack reacher is minding his own business drinking a cup of coffee in an outdoor cafe in new york when he happens to notice a man get in a car and drive away the next edward lane want to know just what he observed as it seems the ransom for the kate and jade lane his wife and stepdaughter went away with that car lane it turns out is the head honcho of a group of mercenaries and it seems five years ago his first wife had also been kidnapped murdered too so things are n't exactly looking good for kate and jade back then lane went to the cops and lost his wife he wants no police involved this time so he hires reacher and thus begins another jack reacher adventure each one better than the last one would n't think that were possible but it seems childs is a writting magician pulling thrilling rabbits out his hat one right after another this is jack reacher 's tenth time out and though it 's possible to read it as a stand alone i 'd definitely want to read the first nine if for no other reason then they are just about as good as mystery and thriller writing gets reviewed by vesta iren
my reacher books i 'm in australia all come with the blurb on the back cover heralded by jack want to be want to be with '' personally i think this is cheddar city and actually detracts from the books appeal to the uninitiated if they had n't been recommended to me i 'd have probably picked one up seen those 3 lines and gone 'gag no way ' i think i 'll tell lee child myself via his website i 'm a woman and i 'm not reading the reacher books to go gooey over jack 's attributes ! i will say this they are cracking good reads and i hope he does n't make the mistake of writing more in the third person message to lee above blurb not a selling point ! cheers
this is an excellent addition to the reacher series reacher is relying more on guile than violence these days and this outing requires his inflicting only some broken bones and i believe four fatalities the plot is nicely convoluted although a clever reader will early on suspect that all is not as it seems the characters are well developed and the major locales new york and rural england are evoked more than adequately lee child 's work is definitely a cut or two above the field in all respects with the writing quality more than high enough not to present distractions from the story
with several hundred amazon rave reviews it seems overkill to add another but what the heck the lincoln lawyer '' is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best connelly 's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars the drinking bars as well as the ones before which you conduct trials borders on magic the plot here is amazingly diabolical just when you think you know where it 's going connelly pulls the rug away haller is a wonderful character delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a somewhat tarnished heart of gold i hope connelly keeps bringing him back but i hope he does n't retire bosch either i think connelly should turn out two books a year one of each guy i know it wo n't happen but i can dream thanks again connelly for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights
how do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you 've ever read this was a highly entertaining story but the book 's real success is its longevity you continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it hands down this is connelly 's best novel few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end mick haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works to him it 's a machine and he 's the greasy angel '' who keeps it well oiled even though haller 's cynicism is a constant source of amusement his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client who can pay top dollar accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman louis roulet hires his services what first seems to be a straight forward case will ultimately test haller to his limits his family will be threatened he will be accused of a crime and someone very close to him will die not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system the writing is
i got this book unabridged on cd i would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects my wife and i usually have our own books that we 'll read together but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too even though she was n't listening to it to begin with upon discovering i had listened to some without her my wife was like what you listened to it without me ! '' my response was i did n't even think you were listening to it '' that 's how hooked you can get on this story the lincoln lawyer follows the story of mickey haller a criminal defense attorney whose personal life is teetering he finally gets a break at work when the perfect case falls into lap the client is called the franchise '' due to the fact that he 's a who pays well and more importantly as the case continues mickey starts to detect red flags as his client does n't seem all that trustworthy it reaches a crescendo when a good friend of his murdered while working on the case this book is n't good because of plot in fact i found the plot to be pretty man gets mysterious client client turns out crooked story turns into a big whodunit blah blah blah this book is good because of the writing it 's both intelligent and believable you really start to gravitate towards the characters because each has their own distinct personality if there 's any problem i have with the writing it would have to the liberal use of the do people actually use it that much in law it made things feel more like a construction site it may be there for shock value but you 'll get numb to it before you 're even a third of the way through all in all an interesting read that will keep you up late saying just one more chapter ''
michael haller 's life revolves around criminal defense his an attorney operating out the back of his lincoln town car his appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy people either called him mick or mickey tall dark and intelligent with his good looks and irish blood lines made him a catch in the court room he was very together with great timing in his personal life it was a mess at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter his father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to his father wrote books and practised law that did n't have room for innocent clients so far mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just would n't recognize innocence if it came along being an independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who could n't afford to pay his fees in total he kept four lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour what he was really looking for was a franchise player a case to keep the cash rolling point blank a meal ticket louis ross roulet dealt in la property he was a rich playboy currently booked on charges of gbi and attempted rape and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court mickey could n't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook this was all too easy in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case just as he was on a roll mickey 's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just did n't sit right in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil this is the first time in a long time that i have picked up a book based on a court room drama but this book is much more than just that michael connelly has done a wonderful job his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through well written and easy to follow so you do n't get lost in the jargon of law especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the us law system i 'm hoping very much that connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer mickey haller in other books going forward congratulations to michael connelly for a rollercoaster read
very interesting cast of characters would make an enjoyable tv show more original than what is on today
connelly really brings the characters to life the farther into you get the faster you want to turn the pages
the lincoln lawyer is hilariously and profoundly true if you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a criminal attorney this book will show you i am a civil attorney myself and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law not that civil trial law is without its warts either put simply this novel is about the client from hell '' every lawyer has had one at one time or another but not like this connelly 's depiction of the protagonist 's slow descent into is engrossing hilarious and the only bad thing about this novel is that it might discourage some readers from a career in law or maybe it will encourage others hard to say what i can say is that this is a and engrossing novel that i could not put down until the final moment that is high praise indeed this is a remarkably novel that keeps the reader guessing until the very last minute you will come to know and care about the characters in this novel not only is the plot in this novel interesting and even engrossing but unlike a john grisham novel the characters are as well this novel rings with authenticity this is my first michael connelly novel but it will not be the last not by any means this one is highly recommended
michael connelly is the best and this new direction will hopefully going to continue good read
i loved this book the pacing was perfect the characters and the writing style engaging mickey haller the lincoln lawyer of the title and protagonist is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his lincolns he gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker the author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read this is the first michael connelly book i 've read but based on this one i 'm going back to read his others
criminal defense attorney mickey haller is thrilled to find himself in the position of defending louis ross roulet against a charge of attempted rape and aggravated sexual assault with grievous bodily injury for his alleged attack of reggie campeau a hooker with a past roulet is what experienced attorneys call a franchise '' client he 's willing to be billed full schedule a top dollar legal fare he 's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense but roulet 's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens haller because despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not haller becomes convinced of his client 's innocence he recalls his deceased father 's advice to other lawyers the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client '' haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man it 's only when haller recognizes the startling similarities in appearance between the victim campeau and martha rentoria the victim of jesus menendez one of haller 's former clients who is now cooling his heels for life in san quentin for that particular murder that haller begins to scratch his head and investigate roulet 's case more deeply all is not as it seems as haller not only wrestles with legal ethical dilemmas but even finds himself in the disturbing position of being investigated as a suspect for the very assault for which he is defending roulet even his family has been threatened and haller must take action to protect his daughter and to resolve his ethical legal dilemmas to clear his own name as a suspect to free menendez from what he now knows is an unjust conviction and in the bargain to snag the mastermind behind the whole twisted mess ! a tall order indeed but connelly has proven that he is up to the task he 's also tossed in a beautiful plot twist at the very point where a reader would be convinced all was in hand it 's difficult to expect much more out of any crackerjack suspense novel characters are marvelously developed the baddie in the piece is portrayed as truly evil and abhorrent in fact you can almost feel the shivers going up and down your back when haller recoils from his simple touch fernando valenzuela the bail bondsman and raul levin haller 's crack investigator are wonderfully down to earth and realistic maggie mcpherson haller 's is portrayed as a skilled competent prosecutor but also frequently lapses into a man 's stereotypical bitchy even teddy vogel a top lieutenant in the road saints motorcycle gang is colourfully portrayed and jumps completely alive off the page ! dialogue is realistic and credible connelly 's expertise in the legal field is obvious as he gives us an extraordinary insider 's look at the procedural machinations of both the defense and prosecution sides of the law system as well as the official police and unofficial defense investigation of a crime grisham baldacci tannenbaum look to your laurels ! there is a new star in the firmament of legal thrillers and his name is michael connelly it will be a sad day indeed if connelly does n't reach the decision to bring haller and his team back again for our enjoyment paul weiss
didion produces a masterful detailing of miami history through cuban immigration and their rise to power in the city highly recommended
the story of the cuban exiles in miami deserves to be told with drama and passion because that is what it has been in this joan didion captures the rejection and racism that the cuban exiles first encountered in miami when they emigrated from cuba after castro assumed power she shows how some of the cubans became successful businesspersons political powerbrokers shapers of local culture renowned humanitarians and philanthropists expert propagandists able diplomats drug runners muggers and internationally renowned terrorists we see the close relationship the cuban exiles formed with the usa government especially its clandestine agencies we learn that in the miami essentially became a cia recruiting and center didion tells us that the cia had as much as regular agents '' full and stationed in south florida it had a flotilla of small boats often used for terrorist raids on cuba making it the third largest navy in the western hemisphere at the time it owned airline companies in the miami area and holding companies that lent itself loans for covert operations there were also hundreds of pieces of miami real estate residential bungalows maintained as safe houses waterfront properties maintained as safe harbors '' as well as fifty five other front businesses '' and cia boat shops '' guns shops '' travel and detective agencies pp yet the relationship between the cuban americans and the usa has been a troubled one although the cuban americans find themselves dependent on the usa for maintaining their struggle against castro they also do n't trust the government blaming it for their loss at the bay of pigs and for adopting policies soft on castro likewise the usa finds some cuban americans helpful in its secret foreign adventures chile nicaragua angola etc as well as a nuisance when these terrorist elements assassinate foreign diplomats blow up airplanes and banks and murder usa citizens particularly poignant is didion 's description of the cuban americans ' personal and often internecine struggle over understanding themselves as immigrants or exiles these struggles have resulted in broken friendships shunning public ridicule financial loss bodily harm and death the book only covers miami until 1987. i wish didion would update the book although it might be dangerous for her to do so this is a great read and well worth the purchase
i read this book so many years ago but i just now realized i had never shared my opnions about it i had lived in miami for about eight years and i think i was in my year or so when i finally heard about miami '' by joan didion it was only after i had finally moved to the beach that i happened upon it at kafka 's at any rate it is an excellent book i think about it every time i hear on the news about the bumbling cia or news of castro makes the nytimes incidentally 1987 also saw the publication of the corpse had a familiar face '' by edna buchanan another equally excellent book about this city i also highly recommend a book of common prayer '' by didion
d is for deadbeat is an odd story kinsey is hired to give to a should be simple right not with sue grafton writing the book ! ! when kinsey 's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting ! ! next kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check he was dead now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid ! this is the first sue grafton book that i read and i was hooked after reading it it 's exciting and keeps a fast pace so you 're never in danger of becoming bored the plot is well developed as are the characters we see more into the personalities that make up not only kinsey but henry the landlord as well if kinsey were older or henry younger you might see some romantic sparks fly but that 's not in the future only a deep friendship grafton also starts expanding the supporting cast of characters with a glimpse at rosie the hungarian diner owner down the street the people grafton writes about are all flamboyant in their own ways definitely a great book to spend some time with but make sure you have the next book e is for evidence ready to pick up as soon as you read the last page of this one you wo n't want to stop reading !
the client came to kinsey millhone with an easy job she to a kid a little odd and kinsey was n't sure what to make of this thing so she takes alvin limardo 's retainer check anyhow it turns out that his real name is not alvin limardo but john daggett and the check of course is as phony as he is john daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals but he was n't just a deadbeat by the time kinsey caught up with him he was a dead a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead there was four in particular that really wanted him dead kinsey knew his death was no was a plan to kill john but which one of the four did it kinsey must put her detective skills to work and find out someone 's secret
i found this to be one of the best of sue grafton 's books so far i found it extremely suspenseful and was guessing all the way up to the end as to who was the murderer the ending surprised me and saddened me i have found myself engrossed in the series and ca n't wait to get on to the letter e ''
private investigator kinsey millhone is back again in this fourth installment of sue grafton 's alphabet series this time she is offered a fee to give a cashier 's check to a young man named tony gahan the check for the fee bounces and kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her plus the young man she is to give the cashier 's check to everything she finds out about her client is bad he is a drunk who has killed several people in a car wreck and appears to be a bigamist when he is found dead kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives this book is written in grafton 's usual breezy style and kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book i would recommend the whole series to
sue grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting four books in and i still ca n't wait to read more ! and she gets better with each book in this book and to a smaller degree in 'c ' there were many times where i could n't fathom how kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case but she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest kinsey 's development as a character is also very well done she is a very real likeable person with amazing depth
irving penn a career in photography is a book that examines the work and life of photographer irving penn several different writers and people associated with penn have included text to describe their view of penn and his life in photography colin westerbeck issey miyake martin harrison edmund carpenter rosamond bernier colin eisler and jennifer jankauskas all contribute to the book writer and editor colin westerbeck invites the reader into the history of irving penn through a summary of penn 's life in his photo career he begins with penn 's early fashion feature called flying down to lima '' where after a case of airsickness developed a new vision that changed his view of photography westerbeck also mentions penn 's different styles and renowned photo shoots including his many photos of various celebrities wedged into a corner he created out of theater flats and also penn 's move to platinum prints the remainder of the book comprises penn 's more famous photos in total there are 193 in the book some which correspond to the text irving penn a career in photography is an excellent book for anyone interested in photography or even a professional looking for inspiration though it is a large book approximately 10 '' by 12 '' its size is fitting for a photo book so that all the images can be easily seen and appreciated the selection of photos is also suitable in that they are some of penn 's best and most known to the photo savvy and are also mixed in genre the text contributed by the aforementioned people help describe and reflect penn 's photos and also show his many styles techniques and views on photography though these stories are informative to the reader they can also get confusing and tough to read as some of the writers tend to overuse unnecessary wording and phrasing however the excellent use of relationship in design and content work well in presentation and contributes to an overall superb book
one of the most significant photographers of the twentyith century irving penn 's captivating photographs throughout his career are wonderfully showcased in this book from his humble beginnings as a graphic dsigner in the 1940 's to his portraits of the native peoples from the far reaches of the 's work has had a major impact on not only the world of photography but aslo the art world as a whole this retrospective of penn 's body of work is much more thorough than expected the graphic quality of his work really speaks to me as a graphic desiner weather it be his rich photographs of nude women or his famous portraits of politicans actors and fashion models the numerous illustrations of penn 's corner shot were a nice surprise in the book many of these images are very difficult to find on the internet it was great being able to study the nuances of the portraits up close a beautiful and informative book that any penn fan would love
i like this book because it is very interesting and informative i began reading it for pleasure but by the time i was half way finished i was sure of its serious nature and had decided to adopt it as a required reading in the seminar that i teach on the economic impact of globalization the author succeeds in presenting the right mix of theory and history with sufficient analysis it is well researched and very well organized it should prove as interesting to the general reader as it is informative for the academics however its treatment of classical economists is far superior to the section dealing with contemporary writeres on free trade hopefully in the second edition the author will remedy this shortcomeing
preeminent economist and npr paul krugman 's review of this book is online http
as a graduate student i have gradually acknowledged the hidden rules of practicing sciences that unfortunately has never disclosed themselves during the regular programs this book demistifies science and its practioners in the field using scientific methodology this book becomes my favorite text at the expanse of kuhn
latour 's book science in action '' is more trendy but i suggest you read this earlier book instead it 's clear and makes its points in a compelling fashion
i give this book a high rating because of its influence in the field it is the first case study of laboratory science ever published and is often quoted in anthropology sociology and philosophy of science the book 's conclusion is social constructivist in nature to a very extreme degree scientific facts are not discovered they are constructed through social processes the actual study was done by latour a french philosopher and the method was to assume strangeness that is latour pretended he did n't know anything about what the scientists were doing and tried to make up construct an account the usual problems with relativism plague latour and woolgar 's brand of social constructivism most notably issues with reflexivity if scientific accounts are constructed and do not have to do with the phenomena why should we think that laboratory life tells us anything about the phenomena of laboratory science their answer is that we should n't the only question in evaluating texts is are you convinced '' if not fine come up with a better more persuasive account people who think that science philosophy and academe in general should have something to do with the real world will be horribly frustrated by this conclusion but everyone should be frustrated by the fact that the conclusion just does n't follow from the data latour gathered it seems to come entirely from prior convictions of the authors i recommend reading the book however because of its popularity and because it is a fantastic exemplar of a bad relativist and constructivist argument get the revised edition which has a postscript and extra references for a chuckle look up some of the reviews cited in the ed references from scientific journals they are mostly cheerful recognitions of the book 's subject matter laboratory science without any reference to or argument with the strong claims it makes you wonder if these people acctually read the book
wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation ' to 'civilize ' the world read colonize for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that and although he did n't knock it down he made his and in spectacular fashion in one way the martians the conquering british with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells ' dark tale was also a warning that even the despite their firm belief in their world could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british or anyone else 's false boast of superiority in the end though it 's a hopeful just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british alien way was not the native way of life in the colonies suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense and that 's why it 's still in print a hundred years later wakely author of an audience for einstei
war of the worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but i kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to hg wells ' original story especially the flick so i decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by the modern library looked rather sleek and sexy i know it 's sad but i like my books to look good wells was actually the first writer to do the 'alien invasion ' story and tells it from an everyman 's perspective like in that awful movie signs only much much better our unnamed narrator is some sort of who lives in rural england he is pals with a man named ogilvy who works in an observatory and is one of the first people on earth to notice a series of explosions on mars and projectiles launched towards our blue planet when the projectiles cylinders arrive no one is really freaked out but approach them with interest and curiosity our narrator feels the same way but slowly realizes that he should keep his distance it 's interesting to note how people either react with indifference or ignorance in these first few chapters before the advent of tabloid media and long long before those dreadful cell phones were invented it would be totally believable that major news such as alien landings would spread through the country pretty slowly as you know the martians turn sour and decide to start zapping everyone off the face of the planet with their mysterious and tripods our narrator reacts with smarter logic than the rest and keeps a cool head while everyone else is a panicking idiot i did get a little bit bored in the middle when our nameless narrator tells the story of his unnmamed brother in london a thin attempt at fleshing out the chaos elsewhere but it picked up the pace again rather quickly after that it is a rather short book also and i feel like a total moron at the fact that it took me a month to read it i did get pretty ill in the middle which made the boring bit even worse and i put it down for a couple of weeks i planned to read it in a few days but i guess fate was against me you know the ending already and how the martians are defeated by germs which might seem a bit of a to any young readers but to me reading it like it was 100 years ago a world i particularly like the old english countryside filled with inns cottages paperboys pubs and post offices it 's rather ingenius hg wells must have been a really smart guy to come up with stuff like this war of the worlds is an undeniable classic and is still far superior to any and of the movies give it a go for sure
beware the war of the worlds is nothing like the movie with tom cruise it 's better it 's interesting to look back at at life 100 years ago and see how they used the little technology they had to fight off the enemy this book is entertaining if you can put yourself in the era that it was written it 's not easy to understand however there is a lot of old english
i consider the war of the worlds '' to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time it has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time the original story is set in england at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story evans does an excellent job in altering the language to fit current usage while maintaining the integrity of the original story the abridgment retains all of the excitement of the story and the presentation is suitable for the target level of reader the illustrations capture the action i was particularly struck with the detail of the facial expressions
the martians have arrived let the war begin '' a catchphrase that could easily be employed for herbert george wells 's most acclaimed science fiction the war of the worlds '' this is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on mars composed in a first person narrative '' the war of the worlds '' is a gripping saga of the millions of people 's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good the story begins directly with the theme in the last years of the in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions england witnesses the most surreal threat ten bizzare cylinders all containing martians fall near london a wave of bitter agony nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the martians gradually come to terms with the earth 's gravitational strength the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war the greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere this myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots the narrator 's town of maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of woking weybridge shepperton and others the narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin 's place in leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death in his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful martians the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate the latter is a lost soul whose faith in god and religion has broken in the wake of humanity 's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a martian dominated earth is not that improbable if at all naive 's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical this is a marvellous diusplay of wit intelligence and clearness of structure the war of the worlds '' on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation the weahness of mankind in the face of unknown unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and wells applies a very very subtle satire on humans ' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities when the artilleryman admits '' we 're down we 're beat '' with absolute conviction '' the reader fathoms the author 's surrender of the greatest power in the world '' to fate on a much higher level '' the war of the worlds '' is a massive comment on man 's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction composed in a sense of retrospection the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small england territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume but even so '' the war of the worlds '' is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster was a great visonery in the late and it 's no less remarkable achievement that this englishman 's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come the war of the worlds '' is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer 's craftmanship
wells ' war of the worlds is a wonderfully imagined science fiction novel but it is also a biting commentary on its era and on the evils of british imperialism in the late victorian era supposedly inspired by the british decimation of the south african hottentot tribes war of the worlds concerns intelligent pitiless technologically advanced martians invading great britain and laying waste to humanity little more than giant bloodsucking brains the martians care not a whit for the natural world they have discovered and they care even less for its denizens except as a source of sustenance earthly culture is likewise eminently disposable wells rather intentionally puts one in mind of jonathan swift 's earlier a modest proposal which postulated that the young children of ireland could make a fine food source for the british and for the same satiric reasons the narrator essentially wells himself is a philosophical writer living in the comfortable west end village of woking he is intimately connected with the martian invasion from day one and becomes a chronicler of it 's inauspicious beginning it 's destructive mark and it 's ignominious end although written in 1896 war of the worlds has a bizarrely century feel to it the pastoral and complacent environs of woking become a perfect counterpoint to the chaotic fog of war death and indiscrimate destruction wreaked by the martians a prescient envisioning of the great war glimpsed in the middle distance of the future and world war two dimly lying beyond wells imagines his martians and their almost sapient war machines in exquisite detail including the martians ' great flying machine martian technology literally suffocates humanity the black smoke and is so advanced that it renders humanity 's technology obsolescent bows and arrows against the lightning '' wells ' commentators include his intellectual narrator who becomes a kind of british everyman a artilleryman who envisions a pragmatic future under the martian heel even while plotting the invaders ' overthrow yet significantly he lacks the energy to do more than dream the and unthinking curate who calls blindly upon god even while it is evident his faith has been shattered beyond restoration and the narrator 's brother who fights manfully against the blind panic that has gripped humanity in its talons taken together these four characters represent all the aspects of man the downfall of the martians as most people know is caused by insignificant microbes the humblest things on god 's green earth '' to which the martians have no resistance substitute natives '' for microbes '' and the ending presages the setting of the sun on the british empire the meek do inherit the earth war of the worlds moves along at a good clip the writing is crisp though prolix in the fashion of the ninteenth century there are a few disconnected sentences missed by the editor 's blue pen essentially nicks in the fine surface of this very fine story while not as well written as the time machine war of the worlds grips the imagination more powerfully this slim book has been the direct inspiration for a number of films and tv shows and several recorded versions including orson welles ' famous 1938 mercury theatre production which caused widespread panic in the northeastern united states archetypal war of the worlds has also indirectly influenced virtually every alien invasion movie and show ever created from alien to zardoz war of the worlds all but singlehandedly created its genre
i 've been reading novels for a long time i like but sometimes i 'm very selective when buying a with war of the worlds well this was different i 've seen the different films etc i decided to read the novel to my surprise it was more interesting than any of the movies or any other thing i 've read it 's interesting how a novel that was written so long ago has so many details regarding things of the future or technology and it 's interesting because the author did n't put the enemy with weapons like bombs that could destroy an entire galaxy or something like that it was just a simple laser and a few robots it keeps the novel in a small place he did n't try to cover the whole world with this just this city and villages but the most important life the survival of the human race and how a man could maintain his sanity or not in such chaos keep in mind that this novel was written a long time ago do n't make like some idiots that tells you or write critics saying what 's the fun in it what happened with the armies the new weapons etc it 's a very futuristic novel but do n't compare it with the things we have now just step back in time their time and enjoy the movies were good specially the last one tom cruise well adapted great special effects but read the novel put your self in the shoes of those people who suffer that terrible extermination
transgressions provides readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors there is a gritty precinct novella from ed mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from joyce carol oates steven king is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky i enjoyed transgressions for both its quality and variety while no story in particular was a stand out each provided a sample of the particular author 's style like a buffet a taste is really all you need to determine where and whether you will return for second and third helpings
after the success of his novel blackboard jungle evan hunter ed mcbain turned to what were then referred to as novelettes '' his subject being the precinct detectives of isola think new york as time passed the precinct novelettes grew to novels fifty years later mcbain persuaded nine other mystery thriller and horror writers to submit what are now called novellas '' of around a hundred pages each the result was one of my most enjoyable reads of 2006. i do n't know why i do n't read more anthologies it was in an anthology that i first experienced stuart kaminsky sharyn mccrumb and lawrence block coincidentally one of the best novellas in this anthology is one by block block returns with his enigmatic hit man keller in keller 's adjustment block manages to make us feel empathy for the man although he has sex with a phoenix real estate saleslady keller is essentially a lonely man he needs somebody to talk to he once had a dog but a former girlfriend took it with him when she left he went to a therapist but the therapist turned into a snoop and he had to dust him unwilling to take a chance on a living breathing entity keller buys a stuffed animal to talk to jeffrey deaver also responded to the call with forever in it he introduces tal simms a working for westbrook county sheriff 's department simms is considered a computer geek '' by the rest of the detective squad especially homicide detective greg bear '' latour simms and his eventual partner latour are confronted with several suspicious suicides older rich couples are killing themselves under dubious circumstances in most respects the underdog character simms is every bit as likable as lincoln rhymes i would definitely buy a full length novel featuring simms a new discovery for me was john farris farris 's the ransome women concerns a beautiful art appraiser named echo halloran who agrees to pose for the great artist john leland ransome she 's not only flattered but as a budding artist herself she wants to learn from him her boyfriend police detective peter o'neil is suspicious and with good reason i enjoyed this novella so much i ran right out and bought fury the terror farris 's masterwork i have to admit that ed mcbain 's own contribution merely hate was my principal motivation for purchasing the anthology i needed my precinct fix and it 's great as usual it is post in isola and the detectives are called to investigate the murder of a muslim cab driver through these cab driver murders mcbain capsulizes the reason for the problems in the mid east other writers who contributed novellas were donald westlake anne perry joyce carol oates walter mosley sharyn mccrumb and stephen king all of them were excellent
hopefully ed mcbain 's effort in convincing a stellar cast of fellow writers to contribute the novellas that comprise transgressions '' will induce publishers to encourage more of the same do n't get me wrong i love long novels but in these days when we all seem to have less time than we 'd like the novella is the perfect form to consume in a short period and the novella is a deserving and part of literature nabokov and simenon to name two among many excelled in the form mcbain who contributed an interesting tale of his own deserves kudos for the roster of superstars who joined him in this venture the 10 stories provide a good introduction for those not familiar with the work of some of these writers naturally some stories are better than others that of course being defined by personal taste my own favorite would have to be anne perry 's hostages '' a moving look at the continuing plight of families in northern ireland sharyn mccrumb contributes an excellent southern gothic tale the resurrection man '' and the awesome walter mosley is represented with archibald lawless anarchist at large '' there are also tales by joyce carol oates stephen king jeffrey deaver john farris donald westlake and lawrence block i can truthfully say i enjoyed all 10 stories and a few writers who were less familiar to me will now receive more attention
from what i 've read it seems like a lot of readers bought this just for the king novella while king 's short novella excellent i highly recommend you read all the others too there 's a lot of good material in this big book
as the editor of this compilation ed mcbain aka evan hunter says novellas are rather unusual these days although in the old pulp fiction days they were fairly thick on the ground a novella is as defined in the publishing world a story that is longer than a short story which usually runs up to words and shorter than a novel usually more than words somewhere in the neighborhood of to words and apparently a novella sometimes called a novelette is hard to write because it tends either to compress to a short story or expand to a novel yet the ten writers here none of the neophytes met their charge from mcbain to come up with a genuine novella with aplomb except perhaps for stephen king whose novella really reads like a short story but then he 's a big enough name that it 's no surprise that his story made the book without any criticism as in any collection there are some hits and some misses but in fact i was engaged by every single entry some though were a cut above the rest walter mosley 's 'archibald lawless anarchist at large walking the line ' and lawrence block 's 'keller 's adjustment ' i will admit that i tend to read everything these two writers produce and they are particular favorites of mine mosley in fact i consider to be one of our best writers regardless of genre as is usual for me i could not get as involved in the story by joyce carol oates but i suspect that is some peculiar allergy of mine i 've rarely thoroughly enjoyed anything of hers even though i can admire her skills and obviously plenty of others admire her more than ed mcbain 's contribution takes place in his familiar precinct one theme that recurs in the stories is the changes in the world indeed in stories like 'merely hate ' by mcbain and 'the things they left behind ' by king that is central to the plot by the way the king story causes his usual and still spookily enjoyable frisson with its eerie atmosphere i would definitely recommend this collection to anyone who likes shorter fiction but wants something more substantial than the usual short story scott morrison
novellas are an odd duck significantly longer than short stories and much shorter than full length novels i suspect that it takes considerable self discipline to maintain one 's focus for from between and words which may explain why novellas are infrequent whatever it takes ed mcbain inveigled a terrific coterie of writers to create a series of wonderful stories which can keep you going from the beach to the mountains from the humor of donald westlake to anne perry 's haunting depiction of northern ireland 's troubles '' to stephen king 's eerie recollection of the tangible memories of the victims of to walter mosley 's tour de force creation of archibald lawless anarchist mcbain has forged a memorable collection of just good fiction indeed i hope that this volume becomes a real tribute to ed mcbain 's skill as a story selector ! this is a ca n't miss read
suspense mystery crime readers rejoice and then send a hearty note to ace thriller writer ed mcbain it 's his idea and he made it happen his thought was to tap ten of today 's best writers in the field and ask them to pen an original novella as defined by webster novella is a short novel or a long short story '' not too helpful eh mcbain made it clearer words and then added that it was n't easy to do the novellas may not have been easy for the top ten chosen by mcbain to write but they sure are easy listening compelling frightening and sometimes as in the case of joyce carol oates macabre voice performers michael boatman and anne twomey deliver outstanding readings without overly dramatizing but allowing pause and nuance to add to the tales the two writers on this audio edition need no introduction walter mosley stands tall among those in his field and joyce carol oates continually amazes there 'll be no plot stealers here because the entertainment in a suspense story is found in not knowing what 's going to happen suffice it to say that mosley 's archibald lawless anarchist at large walking the line '' is the terrifying tale of a young journalist 's descent into a nether world and oates 's the corn maiden '' the story of the kidnaping of a mentally challenged young girl is a haunting narrative that will elicit shivers from even the most jaded suspense fans a rare opportunity to enjoy the words of these award winning authors gail cook
reviewing an anthology like this is rather difficult the best way is probably to divide them into three groups the ok walking around money '' donald westlake is the story of hapless thief john dortmunder it 's amusing but did n't excite me merely hate '' ed mcbain the editor of the anthology is a compelling story one of dozens set in the precinct it 's lucky that his knowledge of islam is n't pivotal to the story because there are numerous errors though not quite as glaring as say those in matthew reilly 's scarecrow '' or tom clancy 's the teeth of the tiger '' keller 's adjustment '' lawrence block is a character study about an unusual assassin i have n't read anything else by block so i ca n't really say much more the the corn maiden '' joyce carol oates did n't live up to its billing a spiral of destruction and despair '' its language shifts on a dime from educated to stilted and it 's badly edited too one character 's surname is spelled different ways the resurrection man '' is a fictional biography of a man doing a necessary but despicable job in the century it 's fascinating but rather thin on plot the great hostages '' anne perry is the most literary '' of the works here but it 's still a compelling read about the tragedies of human nature archibald lawless anarchist at large '' walter mosley would make a great novel the things they left behind '' stephen king is an elegy about life loss and ultimately hope in the wake of it 's also the shortest novella in the anthology by far the ransome women '' john farris is an unusual love story and a perfect entertainment for a rainy night forever '' jeffery deaver introduces talbot simms he 's an intriguing character and i 'd love to see him get a novel of his own all in all a great read even the novellas are still worth the time
oh my god i passed up buying the complete short stories of raymond chandler for this one mcbain mosley king westlake deaver and block sharing the same book and mind you not with any skinny little throwaway virgin bloody mary shorts but with big phhhhhat novellas the novella is one of the greatest lost forms of detective fiction a dense polished gem waiting for future generations to find in a dusty magazine pile or anchoring an obese anthology fitting that ed mcbain whose precinct is still going strong and fresh would revive the novella his own contribution is a new precinct merely hate '' which just simply rocks the theme of religious and cultural intolerance rockets along with serial murder terrorism media satire and those great mcbain cops and characters the whole squad chimes in in the course of this unexpected marvel and it all wraps up in the kind of twist mcbain 's become famous for i moved on to lawrence block 's new keller novelette another score for my favorite hitman and on to donald westlake 's latest raucous caper for hapless dortmunder and felonious friends i 'm saving the stephen king as a sort of creme brulee capper but so far my fictional world has been rocked to its foundations i 'll buy chandler next paycheck
remember what happened to tom paine crucial to the revolution discovered corruption in congress was hounded out of the country they were wise to be worried and so was the south there is a stronger case for states rights today than ever before the european union offers a model of a federation of sovereign states whose central government only controls common interests and does n't interfere in direct taxation or local law but by importing the universal declaration of human rights itself based on paine 's rights of man into law it gives certain guarantees which have hardly been mentioned in the us prisoners ' rights for instance equally the canadian constitution is a good model for a modern constitution it includes the rights of women ! these guys could see the problems how do we get our 'representatives ' to see the problem by turning the us constitution into a kind of holy document we actually work against the ideas of the people who first conceived it this book is an excellent one to give those 'constitutionalists ' who would rather not think for themselves
these often intense and firey speeches made by the or the detractors of the constitution as it was being written and then debated are powerful passionate and sharp enough to make one feel these words were meant to be weapons the front line defense of the freedom and liberty we so easily take for granted today i feel that much of what is wrong in our political system today was predicted here and what would constitute the only real solution active democratic citizenship is also demonstrated here in their willingness to fight against tyranny with reason and passion how much greater our public debates would be today if this were required reading for all citizens ! politics '' would be thought well of again and refer to what citizens do in noble service to communities close to home and far away do yourself a favor get inspired again as to the original principles and purpose of democracy read this book and believe again ! and do something
i have yet to read a dean koontz tale that i dislike he has such a flair for bringing me into the tale as though i am experiencing it myself once i start a koontz novel i find it difficult to go to sleep until i am done i enjoy them so much it seems like a guilty pleasure but it 's just a pleasure no guilt involved
i enjoyed this book detailed plot and different than most of his other books
dean koontz 's latest novel is a great thriller that i found myself not wanting to put down like stephen king i feel some of dean 's best writing is when he is not involving the supernatural playing card in the deck the characters seem a little deeper the story very plausible and the tasks tragedies and triumphs a bit more heartfelt making you the reader care that much more about the outcome the journey to that outcome centers on a man named mitch rafferty mitch lives a simple life with his wife in southern california if that is even possible but bear with me here he owns a small landscaping company while his wife is a secretary at a real estate firm mitch and holly enjoy the simple things in life and dream of raising a family of their own soon one day while on a job site a call on his cell phone changes his life forever on the other end he realizes his wife is in danger and she is not alone a man tells him that they want 2 million dollars raised in ransom for her release or she will be killed he is given only 3 days to accomplish this seemingly impossible task the confusion and terror start here mitch does n't even have in the bank let alone 2 million they seem to know how much he does have in the bank right down to the penny they also seem to have an eye on him at all times audibly telling him in to watch a man across the street right before he is killed by a long range rifle they do this to tell him they mean business and that if he goes to the police they will slowly cut his wife up into pieces mitch loves holly more than anything in the world but do n't think for a second that koontz saturates us in the meaning of family love and life we get that description in good doses but the theme here is all about surprises shock value and the continual tests and tasks mitch must face in order to bring holly home safe the novel is a thriller to say the least from the first page to nearly the last mitch rafferty suddenly has to become something different in order to do anything for love more of his family becomes involved though at first indirectly and this is when we are introduced to his brother anson who ultimately plays a bigger part in the whole thing than we can imagine koontz does an excellent job of developing the characters of mitch and his older brother who are different in more ways than one last but not least is holly the loving wife of mitch who has found herself in a dark place and has to spiritually and cunningly try to outwit one very psychologically profound abductor detective taggart is another character that adds a whirlwind of suspense to the overall setting taggart is good at his job so good in fact that he quickly finds holes in mitch 's story regarding the day the pedestrian was gunned down near his job site as taggert begins to pursue mitch with guarded skepticism mitch realizes that his bloody and harrowing journey to save his wife 's life is only going to get more complicated as time goes on the only knock on this novel was the ending koontz wraps it up in a way that you are not really expecting necessarily but at the same time it leaves you perhaps a tad disappointed with the simplicity of it a lot of loose ends are left open for speculation as we do not get to see what all happens with the clean up of the aftermath left in mitch 's wake as the final few hours tick away in a sprawling web of gunman kidnappers police and pedestrians we do learn the fate of mitch his wife one of the kidnappers anson taggert and julian campbell a business associate of anson 's but other characters that came into play are i guess just hauled off to the morgue in obvious fashion the scene in the desert with mitch facing off against two gunmen at night was superb koontz did a good job of describing the landscape it takes place in as well an envisioning the fright and caged animal scenario that our main character is facing despite some nitpickings a reader may find i myself loved the story you 'll find all the suspense mystery and psychological string pulling you could ever want in these 416 pages
a real page turner i let one coworker borrow this book and then the next i wonder if it will make it back to my bookshelf buy it you will not regret
this story hooks you immediately and keeps up a fast pace throughout if you like koontz 's style you wo n't be disappointed with this entry
again and again dean koontz surprises and delivers with phenomenal books this is an excellent read and i highly suggest it for fans and first time koontz readers alike
the husband was a good read nothing over the top just a straight forward suspense novel dean koontz is always an enjoyable read
i listened to this while driving cross country it definitely helped the time pass by and was entertaining but it did get a little slow at times
farmer in the sky is one of 14 juvenile '' science fiction novels written by robert heinlein stranger in a strange land the puppet masters etc between 1947 rocket ship galileo and 1962 podkayne of mars it is not one of the author 's best works but probably the most typical that is the best single example of his work fitting in more ways than one right in the middle heinlein 's juvenile novels are all exceptionally as entertaining and enlightening for adults as for teenagers but appropriate for kids to read each novel with a couple exceptions deals with space exploration in settings that expand on the previous novels first the moon and later on the stars farmer in the sky written in 1950 and first published as satellite scout '' in boys ' life magazine was one of heinlein 's last limited to our solar system after his characters had explored the moon mars and venus but before moving on to the stars a step barely hinted at in this novel and the next between planets it 's the story of young bill lermer and his widowed father george who decides to emigrate to ganymede one of the four larger moons of jupiter bill feels abandoned when george remarries apparently because it 's a requirement of emigration but he 's determined to stick with the newly restructured family and fly to ganymede with them there 's plenty of suspense and adventure on the space journey and on the new world the author 's writing style and depth of characterization is superior to typical juvenile novels like tom swift or the hardy boys heinlein works in appropriate ideas and lessons for young readers like a character perceived as an irresponsible inconsiderate jerk at the beginning who turns out to be a reliable friend by the end and a few examples of dealing with death and catastrophe as well as his usual tidbits of philosophy such as a discussion of population pressure inevitably leading to war an event realized in the next novel in the series between planets i believe this is the first novel ever to seriously explore the concept of terraforming a desolate alien world for human colonization it is also unique in the skillful marrying of two diverse genres or at least settings the futuristic space adventure and the pioneer farm family heinlein was raised on a farm without changing pace or belying characters heinlein revisited that concept in later books like tunnel in the sky but with less contrast if you 've never read heinlein farmer in the sky would be a good one to start with even if not the best overall it 's good enough to get 5 stars for readers of all ages
there 's some good information about york on the web but the best source is the biography in search of york this fascinating and book brings together all that is known of york it is not only a great book about york but one of the best books in the l c literature
this was the only book i could find about the slave who went to the pacific with lewis clark it was published by colorado associated university press in 1985. exellent foundation for further research on york very readable with good illustrations footnotes
this is the book that have shipped with every copy of sharepoint portal server 2003. i have n't looked at the paper copy in quite some time the searchable pdf copy of the book that comes as part of the resource kit cd is actually much more useful for me because it 's searchable i refer to it constantly

this book is very thorough there 's some great chapters on customization and server management information that has been until microsoft released this book i have bought every book available for my team and this is the only one that covers sharepoint as deep on the topics of administration search configuration and architecture the has a lot more as well my team references this book frequently to me it 's the first true sharepoint administrator 's book available

i have been using the microsoft resource kits on many products over the past 10 years and the sharepoint 2003 kits is one of the most comprehensive produced to date for a microsoft application the book is designed as a resource kit to pull together all relevant information in one location our company placed an order on as soon the sharepoint resource kit was listed as the early sharepoint 2003 printed documentation was sparse and the book was a welcome addition we found it better to have a paper book with all the information in one location rather than just links to websites whitepapers and webcasts to rely upon alone we now have 3 copies for our project teams to used for their sharepoint work as well as the internet resources i found the structure of the book confusing at first as we used it to help learn the product but now it is a great daily resource the adobe pdf manual and several tools are included on the and are great for finding support materials in a jiffy yes its a
tom wolfe pursues the idea that many americans and brits since world war ii have been checking out of mainstream status competition in favor of pursuing status within distinct subcultures this plays out in some interesting ways most notably wolfe watches natalie wood pursue status in a more traditional way by acquiring knowledge of art and even some old masters while others play their own status game around photographing celebrities in this case wood herself essays on hugh hefner california surf culture and london mods are also worthwhile as is a comic piece on wolfe 's misadventures with an automated hotel '' wolfe does bog down at times however in the minute stylistic details of the groups he covers if you are not that interested in style in and of itself your eyes may glaze over those passages still this is a good read for anyone interested in subcultures especially of the and
i have read this book two times once as a teenager and now years later it is a great book and easy to read i was amazed as a teen ager and now how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around america in a camper and write about it he can do more than write well about things he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him
favorite memories of this book come from years ago when i could not put the book down as i read of steinbecks travels with his poodle for those whose minds wander and wonder about the roads towns and people of the i highly recommend this book i am purchasing it to read again
this book is vital and interesting even across the gulf of the years since it was written steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60 's generation gap '' and even the far side of war ii industrialization and urbanization steinbeck dislikes superhighways and cities and is most comfortable on country roads and in rural areas steinbeck and his dog charley fight bureaucracy park rules bad moods and mistrust of strangers with free liquor good old american hospitality and wit along the way he encounters uncooperative canadian border guards quaint european migrant farm workers his own politically polarized family rich texans and other exemplars of the melting pot the book 's climax is steinbeck 's description of racial tension in the south over the integration of public schools he describes a performance by the new orleans cheerleaders '' a group of racist women who yelled obscenities at white children and their parents who escorted them as the children dared to attend grade school with the first black children allowed in steinbeck pulls this off through his remarkably pleasant narrative voice reading this book is like spending time with your great uncle you know he is basically nostalgic and prefers things the way they were rather than the way they are but he stops short of being tiresome about it and does n't seem to blame you in writing about america steinbeck directly demonstrates some of the best things about the american character he honestly reports the good and the bad believes that people are basically good and striving to improve and shows that honest respectful relations between individuals can cure or at least make tolerable most of society 's ills
first i must admit to a certain bias here i travel a lot i travel with a dog as a companion and i enjoy reading this particular author i was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date i can relate to this work ! that being said this is one of those books that i have reread several times over the years and year after year i find that steinbeck 's observations contunue to be relevant this is a very easy reading book i do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though that this is not a novel despite what his son said ! it is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author 's eyes it is interpreted through the author 's past expierences and how he preceives the world i am sure that any ten or one hundred people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten or one hundred different stories and interpretations of those stories i shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations others i did not that is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read or better yet talk to others and agree or disagree enjoy their views i certainly can not fault the author 's usage of language syntax and organization it is all good solid steinbeck this is one of those books that can be read on several levels you can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in america or as i do you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author as a side note i do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring i can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies etc of this day and age i might suggest though that you give it another read in a few years perhaps you will look at it differently i know i have expierence that with other works by different authors all in all recommend this one highly
i first read this book at about age 12. that period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man 's best friend so i was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup took his dog and drove around the united states it did n't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an old guy '' he shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill you want to grab a sleeping bag some grub and hit the road at that time i was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in steinbeck 's camper it would be a few years before i saw the movies of mice and men '' and the grapes of wrath '' which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who john steinbeck was and what he was about in travels with charley '' the reader does n't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of steinbeck 's fiction in this book steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man like andy rooney now that i 'm getting kind of old myself i find myself experiencing the changes in the world steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book when he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer you get the willies along with steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea manned by the very young protecting us yet at the same time menacing the first time i read his description of the waitress in the diner in maine so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy i had never met that kind of person before since then i have worked with many just like her my favorite part was when steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in maine also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous top 40 '' songs on the radio last generation 's castoffs as today 's antiques and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place steinbeck got halfway through the book his dog got sick and everything seemed wrong he witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early the badlands and the south creeped him out and he could n't wait to get back home is n't that just the way a real trip works
i love steinbeck so i try to read what ever he has written this book was a total surprise it is so diferent from his other books i think this would appeal to people who are not steinbeck fans for the loyal reader it is a surprise to see his veiw of a country on the bring of the interstate revolution he observation of trailor park life is great and i hear you can see the truck that he drove at the steinbeck museum in california this is one of my 3 favorite travel books the other two being on the road and henry rollins 's get in the van '' if your going on a raod trip you should bring along one of these books so that you can enjoy the down time
steinbeck 's novels are some of the most powerful statements about american culture available on the planet but who knows the writer travels with charley lets readers get to know john steinbeck how he thinks what he believes in all with great wit and intimacy steinbeck is a very funny man i even learned a new respect for poodles what else could you want in a book
this is one of the best most enjoyable books ever written in my opinion it is a combination history of a now america essay on what it means to be american on the coming modern world on racism on travel even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking memoir history travelogue and poem steinbeck sets off with his dog charley in a glorified pickup truck to see america in 1960. he explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states he meets people he offers opinions he converses with his pal charley and he offers a comment on america past present and future i find this a fascinating thoroughly enjoyable and i 'd even say classic '' read and i would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on america and travel with charley and the great author who drove him around for those familiar with john steinbeck only as a writer of fiction this book reveals a new side and one i think you will enjoy
wish i had bought this book first ! bobbi brinker tells it like it really is and does n't sugar coat anything this book was most instrumental in helping me decide to have an african grey congo in my life

most people who have an african grey parrot and are on the internet have heard about bobbi brinker her birds are commonly called bobbi babies by those fortunate enough to have one of her babies she first wrote this book and self published it as a paperback spiral bound book in 1999. the new book has a wonderful colour cover some additions and corrections and is now published by lucky press this should ensure that more people will have the opportunity to purchase it and read the advice offered by bobbi she dispels many of the popular myths about these birds such as african greys being clumsy or pluckers or birds or needing more calcium she explains how these myths became popular and how to prevent these problems from happening to your african grey parrot she includes several pages devoted to the diet of an african grey parrot going into detail about the vitamin requirements and which foods provide these vitamins and also provides easy to follow recipes the information she includes on breeding and handfeeding will help the average pet bird owner know what to look for when checking out a breeder if you are interested in breeding these birds these chapters will be invaluable bobbi also includes a chapter on the egg giving day by day examples of some eggs as they developed from the day they were laid the final chapter in this book living with greys all things considered answers a lot of questions people have about the behaviour of their bird many behaviours that are normal cause concern for people who wonder if there is a problem when they see their bird doing them if you see your bird twitching trembling nail biting or digging or more you might want to read what bobbi brinker has to say about it
this book has alot of information if you are purchasing or thinking of purchasing a baby grey ! ! i have been looking up alot of information daily with my new baby even though i have owned another grey for 5 years
although i have been a registered nurse for over 20 years i am new to the field of hospice nursing final gifts '' written by experienced hospice nurses provided me with an insight into their world that only knowlege can give this is a must read '' for anyone who deals with death on a regular basis there is a need for a special awareness '' in order to receive the final gift '' that a dying person wants to share
this book was recommended to me by the cancer support group i was going to unfortunately my father died the next day i wish everyone in my family especially my parents had read it before my father died much of what was going on with him would have been more understandable that said this book is a very helpful tool for anyone who has a loved one who has a terminal illness the stories and the explanations of certain behaviors really provide a lot of solace and assistance to the caregivers hospice workers and nurses with extensive experience with the dying have seen it all and have a unique perspective on the phases one goes through in dying being able to understand sometimes incomprehensible statements or actions would make the passage easier for the caregivers the possible conflict of views could be addressed or at least broached i highly recommend this book
i think i 've now bought 6 copies of this book for my own library to lend to people who are interested and might benefit and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering hospice or their grieving families after a loved one 's death i have stage iv advanced terminal or incurable take your pick breast cancer i 've been in treatment continually adjusting as best as i can to new treatments new worries and new symptoms trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way meanwhile final gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those i love once i give up treatment or treatment fails me whichever comes first i 've arranged for a local hospice organization to help my husband and i cope at home having read final gifts it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together he has since completed it other than the date of death so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after i 'm buried and even to write my own obituary to the extent that i know the information all this is done a relief even a pleasure to have had a say beforehand and final gifts which i and then my husband read over a year ago provided the impetus and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty
this book was reoommended by a friend who read it when her husband was dying he had read it also and found it very helpful to understand the process he was going through and he highly recommended it and that says something ! when my mom was passing i read it and although i was scared to read it it actually was nothing to fear was comforting and enlightening and made the process much easier for me as the caretaker and daughter i recognized and understood the things she was saying much better and knew how to respond in some unusual circumstances i recommend this book to anyone dealing with the process of dying i bought extra copies to give to others who are losing someone close to them
i wanted to do some hospice volunteering but was so worried during the training that i was not made '' for this kind of work as i am a pretty emotional sort but during my training it was suggested that i read final gifts to help ease some of my fears it was the best thing i could have done though it is never easy to lose a patient it sure opened my eyes to near death awareness and the needs of those leaving this world i highly recommend this book for anyone one who is losing a loved one one who would like to work with those dying or just one with questions of the end of life process i thank both authors from the bottom of my heart for this book
this book was recommended to my family after my mother received a terminal diagnosis we all read it and i can not begin to tell you what a help this book was during my mothers final journey not only did it help us it allowed us to help her if you or someone you know is dealing with the terminal diagnosis of a family member or friend please read or give them this book
i highly recommend this book for anyone who is going through the painful experience of a loved one 's dying process there are many stories and guidelines for making their transition from life to death a more comfortable and valuable experience and will also help you to cope better i first encountered final gifts '' when a friend loaned it to me after the death of my father while it was too late for him it helped me understand what had happened and i was better prepared to handle the death of my mother less than two years later because of this book my brother sister and i felt we had done everything we could for our mother and it allowed us to feel a definite sense of peace both during that time as well as after she died please do n't allow the occasional repetitiveness of the book stop you from reading it all the way through the authors are well aware of the shock and confusion that you may be experiencing and the redundancies are there to make sure that the message penetrates your grief many blessings on the authors for writing such a priceless book !
in short this was an incredible insight on the process of dying and was very helpful in understanding some of the mood changes and actions of my dying mother if someone you know and love is dying this is a key read to help get through it
final gifts is a very special book it is a guide for those who have never witnessed the death of a loved one or someone who is approaching death the authors are exquisitely sensitive to the needs of the dying the book is a vehicle for enabling the grieving living and dying to come to terms with fate and appreciate the wonders of life 's final journey although not esposing religion the experiences expressed have considerable spiritual content it is a book one can read quickly or as i preferred to read in sections contemplate and read on
great help for me as i teach end of live car
read this book ! you do n't have to be a transsexual homosexual male or female to get a lot out of this book i 'm a married heterosexual female and read this book with an open mind and am so glad i did so kholsa 's transition from a female body to a male one that matched his male brain offers insights on the societal and biological constructs of gender and how our bodies are to think and behave in certain ways by our hormones our sociology and so many other things the fact that kholsa has experienced both sides can help you learn more about yourself and the opposite sex than you ever thought possible written in gorgeous dramatic prose that will keep you turning pages well into the wee hours fantastic ! a great choice for your book club too to inspire hours of lively discussion
this is much more than a story about a man born in a woman 's body who then went through life threatening surgery and alot of sole searching to become the person he is today it is also a study in determination and perserverance i saw dhillon khosla on the view and immediately bought his book i could not believe that he was born a woman when i received his book i read it through in one night something new for me because i had to know the whole story while this book will interest those who feel they too are trapped in the wrong body it is also the story of an incredible journey full of sandtraps and brick walls the intimate story is told with intellectual honesty and is an excellent read
both sides now one man 's journey through womanhood '' by dhillon khosla takes you along with him on a journey no mere mortal could imagine but this is not some science fiction fantasy novel no this is in fact a very personal memoir thanks to a simple twist of fate khosla was assigned at birth a body by kafka his clarity and his intelligence and his perseverance helped him survive and overcome difficult his relatively rare birth defect about one in ten thousand children are born this way there are no telethons and the cure is expensive khosla had to jump through many hoops to get where he is a successful lawyer and talented and the obstacles he faced and conquered in this epic journey were often in his dreamlife the book is smartly laid it includes seventeen black and white photographs and of the chapters cover a specific month in his life with the last chapter a jump cut to the present each chapter begins with a short but telling entry from his dream journal and throughout the book the high caliber of his writing keeps you right there beside him i rushed home from work each day until i finished this book and thought of little else in the interim a fantastic story all the more remarkable for having been lived one can only hope he tries his hand at novel writing next he is a relatively young man so one hopes he will write another memoir someday having lived through more adventures but he has already lived what one could call a crowded hour so his autobiography is by no means premature one hopes if there is another installment that the next one will turn out to be a love story
it 's an intellectual book with alot of funny anecdotes it provides insight as to a person 's emotional and spiritual evolvement the books speaks about many dreams during this transition it seems to me that dhillon was so determined to become his real person that the lines between the physical world and the dream world began to blend it also demonstrates how this person grew spiritually mostly appreciated how he kept a kind heart during some very difficult times
this is the first book that has profoundly moved me in so many ways it has inspired me beyond what i thought a book ever could
like many people who have read this book i am legally blind it was recommended to me by a friend who has very good vision comparing notes with her was particularly educational the perspectives of a sighted person and a blind person on the text turn out to be not all that different this book has incredible ups and downs the ups kleege 's description of what a blind person sees is incredible perhaps the best i have ever read people who have n't had to worry about it are under such misconceptions a lot of people think that if you can kind that what you see is a blur even the cover of this book appears to tell us the same thing but that 's far from true for everyone the author makes the point that the designation of what constitutes legal blindness really was a pretty random decision who says is normal how many people do you know who use some kind of correction given that how normal can it possibly be also just because someone is legally blind they may use their vision so efficiently that you do n't know until they tell you that there 's anything different about them kleege reports this experience in her own life conversely someone who is legally blind may not use their vision at all also her descriptions of the process of making sense of visual information is well done and should help to explain to people who do n't know exactly how sight works how different it can be for various people my favorite of the points made by this book however has got to be that the fact that you can see something does n't mean you 're not blind does n't make it not a good idea to learn braille many of us with some useable sight were refused this tool as children frankly if you ca n't read print at all without pain this encourages illiteracy kleege is spreading the word that braille is not a foreign it 's just another way to percieve the alphabet that we already know she raises the question of whether audio books constitute reading in the same way that reading print or braille do given that it stimulates different parts of your brain i 'd argue no although like kleege i think it 's a useful tool at times now for the downs kleege can be really disparaging of sighted people there are subtle and less subtle digs and jabs all over the book she puts words into the mouths of passing strangers extending a real encounter into a possible outcome making assumptions about what the sighted person would have said if she 'd said something different herself honestly not every sighted person is a complete jerk or ignorant about how sight works she asserts that a mother will stop a child from staring at a blind person because if you do n't look at something unpleasant it will go away no mothers do that because it 's very rude to stare ! my sighted friend was really offended by the middle of the book and actually exclaimed well so sorry i can see ! '' her take on oedipus ' blindness i thought was overly dramatic kleege regards it as symbolic castration setting the stage for the way people percieve blindness to this day frankly oedipus was n't freudian until freud if oedipus had meant to castrate himself given that this is a classical story and they did n't mince he would have i also thought some of her arguments with modern cinema were perhaps a bit harsh not that really bad stereotypes do n't exist movies like jennifer 8 '' portraying blind people as needful of institutionalisation and completely helpless when confronted by a sighted crazy are a real problem the blind are n't the only people stereotyped in hollywood though one could argue that the heroine was helpless as much because she was a woman in a horror movie as that she was blind also was n't the protagonist in scent of a woman '' more stereotypically bachelorish than blind true a lot of movies were clearly directed by people who have never met a blind person however the unmoving stare empolyed by many film directors to typify the blind which kleege finds so exists if one has been blind since birth one sometimes lacks body language never having observed it if one lacks eyes why blink to moisten them sometimes one forgets all in all i really enjoyed this book even though i periodically wanted to yell oh come on ! get over it ! '' i 'd reccommend it to the blind who have not found anyone with whom to relate lately or the sighted who want to understand and one more anyone who gets embarrassed because they just said hey look at this ! '' to a blind person it 's we do it too

this is an easy reading book in 45 fun little chapters to help people gain the basic biblical interpretation skills they need to transform their lives the hendricks ' show us how proper interpretation of scripture is used to fuel our minds for improved based on god 's principles these principles are to be applied in our daily lives to change us and consequently change our corner of the world the overall approach is the same used by most bible study methods that is inductive '' bible study observe interpret apply the authors stress honest observation of the biblical text without the influence of a pretense or agenda to affect the interpretation an extremely detailed and systematic observation of the text being studied is stressed as the most crucial aspect of interpretation proper interpretation is unlikely without the foundation of an extremely thorough observation of the text itself about half the book is used to fully explore the questions and forms of textual observation the book is loaded with practical ways to assist in interpretation during your bible study for example transporting your senses into the story to help relate to david in a cave or paul in prison clever tools like the fingers of your hand can be used to remember 5 things to look for when interpreting a passage another idea is to ask the 6 w 's who what where when why and wherefore wherefore is the so what '' part of life application the authors encourage the application of biblical principles in our lives the final section of the book presents a set of questions and motivations for applying the bible in everyday life there are many lists to derive life application points is there a command to obey an example to follow a doctrine to be believed a recurring theme is the biblical understanding of godly knowledge that is summarized as without doing is n't knowing at all ' i like this book overall but there are a few things i do n't care for i think it is too long and redundant on some points 150 pages on every conceivable of observing a text is excessive chapter 7 for example talks about general reading skills this is good information to mention but i do n't think it deserved a chapter you can get value from the book by selectively reading most of the chapters and omitting some like about 7 of the book this is definitely not the author 's intent but it is how i recommend the book to people who do n't have much reading time another way to improve this book would be more coverage about literary genre parable poetry history letter chapter 29 covers this somewhat but with a book this size i would expect more on this important area for interpreting a text how to read the bible for all its worth fee and effective bible teaching wilhoit cover genre very well and are better choices if you do n't need something as basic as living by the book '' living by the book is a good choice for adult beginners including high school students to get started into productive bible study

think and grow rich is a classic after reading and listening to hundreds of audio books in this subject napoleon hill set the foundation for a philosophy that empowers people towards their greatness this book has helped me in various ways and it is my favorite book to come back to and read over and over again ! i highly recommend it f
i carry this book with me too work all the time to remind me and give me inspiration to strive for more and never quit in reaching my financial goals
this is a great book but you have to read it with the idea in mind that it was something like a million years ago when it was written ok maybe not that long ago i have this in my library because it is an essential piece for any person who like me want to venture out in the unknown waters of gasp aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh self employment got ta think everyday and while your at it read this too use your common sense of course but read it
the single most helpful book in changing the way i thought about myself and my goals buy it
napoleon hill 's gift to each of us who reads and rereads this astounding life recipe is priceless i remain in awe of his rigour insight and persistence if you have n't read this book buy it now read it and read it again then do hill 's exercises exactly as he advises and the world will shift beneath your feet
the title of this book is actually quite deceiving because even though the author focuses on the link between thought and financial success his principals can be utilized in all areas of life i have studied the ancient texts of the vedas and upanishads and have found a strong link between the work of napoleon hill and this ancient philosophy on the power of thought anyone interested in gaining more control over their destiny and success should read this book and not just once but over and over again with every reading more truths are unearthed more clarity is gained and with it a larger perspective of life money is the result of success and sucess is the result of a major definite purpose and a major definite purpose is a thought process so think grow rich and succeed
quantum physicians have started to realise a simple truth we are in charge of our lives and it is us who totally create our reality anything is possible only as long as we can imagine it and if we have the will to do anything required to get what we want we will get it this is a very powerful message and it made andrew carnegie one of the richest men on the planet who later inspired walt disney 's uncle scrooge nobody says that getting rich is easy or that any other undertaking that you may have is however you have the key to your own success in your own hand whatever it is that you may wish for some of the advice that napoleon hill gives may be a little outdated and you may disagree with it however the key message of this book is one that you can not miss and indeed the very easy style of this work does help a lot for the author does not express the key message directly he rather points to it and lets you discover it on your own why because the message is so simply and so powerful that if someone just told you you would not see the importance as much as in this case where you have to figure it out on your own five stars are awarded to this book as it is one that you should definitely have on your shelf it has the power to truly change your life around if only you want it and indeed it is very different to most books as it does n't tell you what to do but invites you to fulfil your dreams whatever they may be read it you wo n't be disappointed
napoleon hill author of this classic will remind you of an older wiser slightly wacky uncle who advises you about careers life and love this book is a wonderful collection of tips many based on the ideas of hill 's mentor andrew carnegie that range from the practical how to prepare a resume to surprisingly new mystical talk about the infinite powers of the universe of course like an old uncle hill can get and repetitive at times but since he packs so much wisdom into his slender book you will want to reread it over and over again repetitions and all we recommend his classic compendium to everyone who is dangling from the career ladder and wondering how to prosper
it never ceases to amaze me how when you read a classic more than once you still get as much out of it as you did the first time hill became famous for his research arguably the first and at the time the most comprehensive on what it takes to create wealth there is a reason why you will have been recommended this book on several occasions by several people it is not 'a ' source on what thinking rich is all about it 's 'the ' source the book hill keeps referring to the 'one thing ' and when you finally catch on it will be a revellation and a turning point for you in your path to wealth enjoy the read brad sugars author the business coac

i read the review from the reviewer who had figured out who did it '' halfway through the book yes i suspected who did it also but there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out etc it seemed like a hopeless situation when i realized the perpetrator i listened to the audio version of this book i usually only listen to audio books as i walk however when i got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was i could n't stop listening i listened to the last two cassettes all morning long if i had been reading it it would have been a true page turner until i reached the end i recommend this story highly it is different than the notebook and the wedding and i applaud nicholas sparks as a writer
a bend in the road is another one of my favorite books of nicholas sparks miles was not very forgiving to sarah 's brother when he told him the truth he could have kept the relationship going sarah was a good person and i good teacher i would like to read that book again

john le has written a touching spy thriller that traces the transformation of a man who loses his wife to a diabolical intrigue and sets out to discover who is responsible the suspects are multinational pharmaceutical companies as le puts it in his epilogue '' it is about individual conscience in conflict with corporate greed '' this story is prescient in its timeliness in 2006 more articles are appearing in the press about the undue influence of pharmaceutical companies upon the medical profession some believe this is a conflict of interest for doctors le 's story posits the use of third world nations as testing grounds for drugs that have not passed sufficient clinical trials and the that rest on such exploitation the writing in this novel is superb le 's writing is spare and poignant he lucidly describes the inner life of his lively and vivid characters the tone of the novel is deeply sad and disappointed it clearly points out where humanity is still failing to rise to its full moral potential despite its mordant critique of the greed of corporations the constant gardener provides high quality entertainment and suspense well done highly recommended
deserving of all accolades it 's gotten and deserving of more than one oscar nomination heartbreaking in the same way that hotel rwanda was
justin quayle is a diplomat with the british high commission in nairobi a mild man who loves gardening quayle is devastated when he hears that his beloved much younger wife tessa has been brutally murdered while attending a conference with her companion african arnold bluhm rumors are rampant and deal with everything from the relationship between tessa and bluhm to the the reason for her murder justin emerges from the paralysis of mourning and decides that his goal is to throw himself into the task of tracking tessa 's quest for human rights in nairobi and thus finding out the motive for murder as he tries to duplicate tessa 's movements during her final days justin discovers that her efforts had been directed at a large drug company which is unethically testing drugs on poor africans who have contracted tuberculosis le carre takes the reader through a seemingly unending series of interviews and manipulations between justin the pharmaceutical company and the diplomatic corps the same effect could have been achieved in many fewer pages but the story remains a haunting and interesting one
i am a sucker for a story in a foreign country lecarre is an great writer and made the african scene very realistic he paints a very clear political picture of kenya that is probably not far from the real political situation in many african nations as a missionary in a third world country i can understand how paternalism and racism sneaks into foreigner 's minds the western characters in constant gardener exhibit extreme paternalistic attitudes toward africa and though ugly and obviously wrong many foreigners use these attitudes to deal with their own culture shock the hero of the story had no problem bonding with the people which is probably the reason for her healthy attitude when foreigners spend time and build relationships with the people of the country they will bond with these people and begin seeing them for what they equals but the majority of the characters in this book spend their time in their western homes only seeing nationals who are servants are these westerners bad people probably not but they have succumbed to paternalism and racism because of their lack of contact and relationships with the people as much as the above paragraph may appear to be a review for a book this book is in fact fiction the story is good especially in the beginning but as the story goes on the end becomes more and more inevitable when a fiction book has an inevitable ending i begin to lose interest this was my first lecarre book and i look forward to reading others of his novels
no one has captured in evocative mesmerizing prose the secret world of spies and diplomacy as brilliantly and as well as british author and former spy himself john le carre in recent years he has turned his attention away from classic cold war plots of espionage skullduggery for which he is best known in his george smiley '' series of novels to take on other equally important issues such as food and medical aid to developing countries in the constant gardener '' le carre offers one of his most exciting novels to date while posing some intriguing ethical questions for which there are no easy answers these include whether the west has a moral obligation to give corrupt third world governments substantial financial medical and food assistance knowing that most of this aid will never reach those for which it is intended he also raises the issue whether the third world should serve the west as inexpensive sites for clinical trials of potential drugs which are harmful to patients who are unwilling participants in these trials in the expectation that these drugs once perfected will be quite successful in curing the illnesses for which they are designed in justin quayle john le carre has created one of his most intriguing sympathetic characters since george smiley depicting quayle 's transformation from a rather nondescript mediocre british foreign service diplomat stationed in nairobi kenya to a driven amateur detective in search of the truth behind the mysterious murder of his young wife tessa quayle le carre demonstrates repeatedly his splendid gifts for dialogue and description as quayle 's quest takes him from kenya to europe and then north america and finally back to kenya in search of his wife 's murderers not only is the constant gardener '' a exciting it is truly an intriguing fictional evocation of the dark side of business transactions between poweful multinational corporations and impoverished third world countries and the rampant deceit which may occur amongst diplomats without question the constant gardener '' is among le carre 's best novels ranking alongside tinker tailor soldier spy '' it is well worth the effort of reading this massive sprawling novel even if you have n't seen its critically acclaimed film adaptation which i have n't yet starring ralph fiennes as justin quayle and rachel weisz as his wife tessa
i am a huge fan of john le carre he could write anything and i 'd be hooked there is no one better at describing the nuances of a character 's persona and i especially like how he has had the flexibility and talent to evolve from a fifties and sixties cold warrior to a modern day master with relevant subjects such as with this one big drug companies screwing poor africa but i found this book to run long and some of the middle passages which are a paper trail investigation not to be compelling there 's a lot of faux newspaper reports that justin quayle the ralph fienes character wades through and an endless interrogation by two police officers who just about disappear later on at the end of a story le carre likes to rid us of his main character if you 're the protagonist in one of his books chances are you 're bound to wind up dead no sequels for you it was true with the spy who came in from the cold it was true for absolute friends it was true in the looking glass war and it 's true here no happy endings for them if you want a better read with the same infused characterizations of the title try the tailor of panama funny crazy and a book that could still have a sequel
john le carre has been writing suspense espionage and mystery novels for more than 40 years now i read the first few of them when i was in high school say 30 years ago and enjoyed them mostly for the odd characters that the author peopled his books with over the years he 's written everything from straight spy novels tinker tailor soldier spy '' the spy who came in from the cold '' and smiley 's people '' around to more romantic spy novels the russia house '' comic versions of the spy novel the tailor of panama '' and even attempted serious straight fiction the largely unsuccessful the naive and sentimental lover '' many of the previous books are more cheerful or eccentric stories so it 's important for the purposes of this review to remember what first got le carre attention the spy who came in from the cold which was published basically at the same time as the james bond movies and which featured a rather drab mundane spy who actually failed to fulfill his mission and i 'm going to give away the plot here actually gets killed at the end of the book failing to save the girl if you keep that in mind when i tell you that the current book is about a pharmaceutical multinational corporation and one man 's challenge to it you 'll have an idea what the book is like le carre has n't much of the time anyway been about plot in the first place his characters and atmosphere and especially his sense of english dialog and personality are very precise and honest at times unflinching his characters especially are very entertaining with their particularly british eccentricities which le carre recreates for you with a steady and sure hand the prose here is sometimes tough for an american to follow witness the other review here but the whole thing has a very english feel to it all in all le carre 's characters carry this as most of his other novels it 's a good book just do n't expect any solutions to the world 's problems here
i wo n't delve into the plot of this novel as i 'm sure other reviewers have covered it and i wo n't comment upon the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry or the african plight though they are certainly and beautifully shown instead i 'll tell you why i found this novel unique it emotionally devastated me this novel was made into a movie and it was marketed as a love story well the love story is not what kicked me in the gut should it have perhaps it was beautiful touching and spiritually uplifting but it 's not what floored me what intrigued me was some characters ' remarkable selflessness what horrified me were some of the characters ' selfish acts that cost others to the extreme devastated me was how these characters justified their actions if these justifications were then i could have dismissed them and the novel and been left untouched but these justifications were n't they were all too real human and worst of all understandable without going into the specifics of my own personal work history i will say that i have seen how people justify their illegal and immoral actions and decisions and how people gradually grow numb to their situations actions and the magnitude of their actions ' consequences the justifications of the characters in this book were all too another thing that greatly upset me was the main character 's last and ultimate action while this action appears at first glance it 's not and that 's what makes it devastating it shows our strengths and frailties the temporariness of ourselves and how insignificant we are this book is not for the feint of heart and i doubt i will pick it up for a skim for many years to come however its depiction of human nature is beautiful if only for the truth of it if you 're a fan of human nature i could n't recommend this book more
i really enjoyed this one as i do most of patterson 's work
i greatly enjoyed this book it is not the best one written by james patterson but it was very good i would recommend it

i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world anyway there are others who have diagramed the story i just wanted to say i enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version
i really liked this book it was a great fast read the only thing was the main character was very emotional a little more than i 'm used to in a male character he seemed to cried a lot other than that i thoroughly enjoyed it
life guard '' satisfied my desire to be entertained as well as to stimulate my intellect this novel really does cover the gamut exhilarating action stunning twists genuine love beautiful settings ethical dilemmas desire for riches mysterious murders detective investigations false accusations and self vindication yet somehow it emerges as neither contrived nor unbelievable this would make an excellent movie however a movie would lack the unique perspectives used in the narration which help make the hero endearing
okay the title is misleading in that reading this book does n't mean you wo n't be lied to it simple means that you will be able to notice when you have been lied to and the book gives some great tools in learning how to redirect the conversation in order to get at the truth while i would n't use some of these techniques for just every day conversations with friends loved ones and family memebers if i worked in a position where investigations were a part of my job such as police or detective work internal affairs human resources and employee disputes etc this information would be invaluable as a tool also when faced with those tough family situations this book does provide some insight into how to tell whether or not a person is being honest with you on that note i used several of the techniques in this book on my almost teen aged son who has recently been having a problem with lying and it 's quite interesting the results i 've achieved with it while he does n't always 'fess up ' in the end i now have a pretty good handle on detecting when he 's being honest and when he 's really just pulling the wool over my eyes in business negotiations contract negotiations this book can really help with determining whether or not you have the upper hand or the competitor is just pulling a 'poker face ' on you during the negotiations if there were a down side to the book the one thing that i could state would be that it does seem to take a negative tone in that it seems the author is stating that people in general can not be trusted and that one should expect others to lie i do n't necessarily believe this to be true and often times we create our own reality and if we expect people to lie we just might create that my advice read the book it has great information however do not automatically assume that just because someone exhibits some of these behavoirs listed in the book that the person is lying this book like any other or self help book is nothing more than a tool to assist you and is not the do all and end all of how to live your life some people can be trusted not everyone will lie to you but when someone does this book helps you to determine how to get to the truth of the situation and be aware of the lies when they do happen if the book is used as nothing more than a tool for its intended purpose it 's well worth the read
i like this book as it offers you advice on what to look for if used wisely this book will help you from being ripped off by deceitful mean the real book shows you techniques to help you get to the truth of chapter has a summary for quick reference i would suggest that anyone buying this book you dont use it against people in your life that you know are genuine and 's an example in the book about friends wanting to see a your friend doesnt like a movie you want to see you get over all tell little white put your friends under interrogation for it for the real crooks
find out what it means when someone turns their back to you while you are talking to them find out what it means when someone walks near the door when you are talking to them find out what it means when someone picks something up and puts it between you and them while you are talking to them find out the hidden meanings highly recommended full of lots of useful information that each and everyone can benefit from
this book was a great help to me in being able to detect when people are lying it shows you how to look at eye contact pauses in speech and unneccesary details people put into lies that they do not put into regular have used these techniques for years
very review of kinesics and verbal wrangeling i have been studying this for years and learned some new things with this book i would highly recommend it to folks involved in interview and interrogation fields
having just finished this book and having identified with many of the situations that russel the main character faces i feel very moved the book is a i 'm so glad that books like this exist for teenagers especially gay teenagers and for like myself who still struggle with what do people think '' issues i certainly learned something from this book and enjoyed the process as well
i am a 17 year gay guy from ohio and let me say this is one of the best books i 've read in a long time i felt and feel like i am the character of russell in the book i 've gone through so many of the things he has i even cried after reading the sequel after this one because it made me look at my own situation and how hard it is to be gay and love someone who might never talk to you again if they knew i feel like this book deserves several awards it certainly had a touch to me
geography club by brent hartinger is the story of russell middlebrook a gay 16 year old who is negotiating the world of high school popularity he is also firmly and solidly in the closet at the beginning of this book and over the course of the novel the reader explores the pitfalls dangers and excitements of being a high schooler and being gay hartinger locates russell 's ' story in the social borderlands he is not super popular nor is he reviled and he is smart and snarky but very insecure when rumors of a gay kid and a gay club start to swirl at goodkind high russell is finally starting to feel good about himself and rise up the popularity ranks thanks to the influence of his closeted jock boyfriend this leaves russell to make difficult decisions that will resonate with any reader who feels or felt like an outsider in high school the story is told in two parts the first focusing on russell 's alienation as he thinks that he is the only gay kid at his high school and the second on the choices he has to make to preserve his charade of straightness he joins in the jocks in making fun of the schools most unpopular kid and the weight of doing so demonstrates the burden of popularity and motivates russell to stop hiding and come out publicly to make it right the geography club itself is a brilliant red herring on hartinger 's part a club designed by its members to purposely be too boring for any one to actually want to join so the few gay kids at goodkind can discuss their lives openly and honestly once russell starts coming out he learns that he is no longer alone providing the character with some reassurance and also his own place in the high school social web even if that place is a secret the entire concept highlights the importance of gay straight alliances for high school students some readers may find themselves overwhelmed by the fast pace numerous side characters and short side plots on the other hand this almost frenzied quality is what gives geography club such cultural authenticity these characters are trying to negotiate the treacheries of high school with its rampant gossip various teenage tribes and strict social norms the geography club finds itself in a web of secrets lies relationships and sexual identities that seems real for those who have attended a public school in the end geography club is a compelling story that highlights the emotional difficulties of being gay but achieves it in a way that even straight kids will relate to personally i wish that i had this book when i was 15. there was nothing out there for gay folks at all and i over identify with min except for the asian part thanks brent
russel middlebrook is pretty sure that he 's gay after all he 's not attracted to girls and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other guys in the locker room he 's never had an actual experience with another guy though so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he 'll outgrow or maybe not while surfing the internet one night he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities where you can talk to other people who are also gay and amazingly enough there 's a boy he meets with the name gayteen who not only lives in his town but also attends his high school another gay boy in his very own school there 's no way that could be true especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle gayteen is none other than kevin land star of the baseball team one of the most popular guys in school as kevin and russel get to know one another outside of school and hidden away from prying eyes they realize that there 's no way for them to be together inside school walls the same is true for russel 's friends min and terese who although they claim to just be really close friends are actually in love so along with a few others including gunnar who is straight and brian bund the loser of goodkind high school the boys form the geography club after all no one else is going to want to join such a boring club especially if they knew it was just a front for a lesbian school group as events at school heat up with brian eventually being outed as gay even though he 's not russel kevin and their friends will have to learn what 's most important in life and that sometimes no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open you 're just not ready geography club is a great quick read from author brent hartinger about the ups and downs of daily high school life and the struggle to find ones identity
brent hartinger the author of geography club here i wanted to respond to the previous reviewer i really am sorry you found my book boring i admit that 's not a criticism i 've heard before and i thought i 'd heard it all about this book that it 's inappropriate for teenagers that it 's too realistic that it 's not realistic enough that it 's too mainstream that it 's not mainstream enough if anything people usually say there 's almost too much going on or that the book moved so quickly they wanted it to be longer but hey we 're all entitled to our opinion anyway yes it 's true i do offer a '' guarantee to people who attend my book events though no one 's ever collected and i 'd be happy to refund the money any dissatisfied readers spent on my book too i honestly do n't want anyone associating brent hartinger '' with miserable experience '' ! and i really really get '' that not every book is for every person the list of books that others liked but that i hated is virtually endless so just send your receipt and a note with your address to brent hartinger po box 720 tacoma wa 98401 but hey i am far from rich the book did well but not that well ! so i 'll only offer this deal for say thirty days from the date of this posting
well written with good plot and likeable characters author has an excellent understanding of teenage angst
seriously i love this guy russel middlebrook in these two books i 'm actually kinda bummed that he 's a character in a book so he does n't really exist cause he sure works for me
nft chicago is the one book to carry around in your backpack as you cruise the city but pay attention to the title it really is not for tourists the first thing to do with this book when you get it is to spend the time to walk through it particularly through the chapters beyond the maps and most particularly through the arts and entertainment '' sections once you 've done that then get acquainted with how the maps work by looking at a map of a neighborhood you know well never mind that it might not include your favorite corner bar or hot dog stand just get to understand how it works with an area you know once you 've made friends with the book then start using it as you walk ride the l '' or drive in the city the street maps are very good and each map identifies key places in the neighborhood each neighborhood map has a listing next to the map tells you about neighborhood banks car washes gas sations hospitals landmarks libraries parking pharmacies pizza places post offices schools supermarkets coffee shops gyms hardware stores liquor stores nightlife spots pet shops restaurants shopping locations and video rental stores but of course only if the neighborhood has say a bank in it i have two minor complaints about this volume the first is that i wish the location markers '' '' were more bolded and more frequent second i would love to have an overall index of places so that for example if i could not remember which neighborhood hopleaf is in i could go to the general index and locate its map reference but i 'm just whining it 's a very well organized well informed and surprisingly complete piece of work for a list price of 16.95 by the way be sure you 're buying the most recent version since it 's published each year if you buy one of the older ones places like millennium park wo n't be in it and as the book itself points out the chicago restaurant scene has exploded in recent years it seems that trendy new hotspots are popping up by the minute '' this of course cuts both ways and the book is careful to point out some of what 's closed and gone as well as what 's new and hot but the moral here is that last year 's book might be very much out of date finally while this book on its own will get you where you need to go i would recommend if you need something to supplement it that you get the latest zagat for chicago
uptown oldtown gold coast north side it seems like chicagoland has another name for every area this book is great just what i needed to explore the areas of chicago it 's organised by areas and lists all of the different things from restaurants to theatres to laundry mats in the area the maps are very clear and easy to read excellent book for people who 've just moved to chicago and are n't after the touristy things i think it 's equally useful for people who live in the 'burbs and downtown dwellers highly recommended
explain this to me why is the actual size of the chicago nft larger than the nyc one the one i have for nyc is small enough to fit in my pocket but the chicago version is just larger too big to easily carry in a pocket but it fits in a bag just fine if for no other reason that the map of the downtown pedway this book is a
this was my bible when i moved to chicago 2 years ago it has both practical information such as video stores post offices bus and train routes on detailed neighborhood maps as well as shopping and cuisine listings i used it and recommend it constantly it was far more helpful than any other city guide i tried and over time i knew the city well enough to put it away ! and that 's when you 're really not a tourist anymore
outside of a few typos i found the 2005 edition of nft chicago to be more useful than past ones which were also useful the main thing is there 's a lot more maps instead of just having central chicago covered it goes all the way to the city 's borders so it 's great when i have to go way south or way west or other areas i do n't venture in very much also it seems like thier arts listings are more comprehensive and there 's a huge new section about what to do with kids although it seems to be targeted to the still it 's an invaluable refernce to have in your car or to hand off to guests if you have to leave them to thier own devices
my boyfriend and i recently moved the the city both of us had visited chicago multiple times and knew the very basics but realized we needed more guidance in navigating the streets and making our way through the maze of information we were finding online regarding apartments and neighborhoods the not for tourists guide was the best investment we have made since deciding to move excluding the fantastic bucktown loft we ended up choosing although the simple and usually cheesy neighborhood descriptions leave something to be desired this guide was extremely helpful in figuring out the basics of each area of the city when searching for places to live it was great to be able to pinpoint the location on the clear and detailed maps and know exactly how far each prospective home was from grocery stores banks shops restaurants and l stops of course nothing was more valuable than actually seeing the neighborhoods for which the nft guide was extrememly helpful while plotting our route we still keep the guide within reach while exploring new parts of the city and it has saved us multiple times while trying to find alternate routes around crazy traffic flow if you are a native chicagoian you will certainly find that this guide is missing some of your favorite spots but is n't that being a local is all about this guide my not predict the places you will love the most but for those who are still trying to discover their very own chicago it will at certainly help you find your way

i really really enjoyed this book it is fascinating illuminating a period often brushed past by other histories giving people and events their due it also does a wonderful job of updating refuting earlier theories of why the western half of the roman empire fell heather 's writing style makes for a good read he knows his stuff and presents his evidence in an authoratative way that does n't come across as stuffy the writing flows in a way that make this work a real page turner i think readers interested in this period or rome in general would enjoy this book and while it certainly feels like a work that would hold its own with a serious student of history a more general reader would hopefully enjoy it as much as i have
this is history as history should be written by turns witty incisive and far reaching heather draws on his broad reservoirs of knowledge of not only of the barbarians and rome but also of modern states and economics surprisingly relevant topics i very much appreciated how heather gave context to the motivations of the sources he quoted taking nothing at face value and wittily translating the sense of old quotes so that the modern reader could understand them the book 's main thesis is that growing numbers of huns armed with devilishly engineered bows caused goths to scuttle for safety onto roman territory and ultimately wreak havoc even further havoc was wrought when the huns themselves showed up at the boundaries of the roman empire ultimately the goths and the huns proved too much for the empire to handle and it fell into disarray heather 's sweeping thesis is told so plainly and well that it seems in retrospect to be obvious for heather to have come to such dramatically different but conclusions on such a topic is really a stunning achievement i have only one quibble with the book which certainly wo n't change my five star rating heather spends nearly the entire 459 pages of the book making the case for his thesis involving the domino effect of huns and goths that toppled the empire however he ends the book with a left hook you do n't even see coming the final line reads by virtue of its unbounded aggression roman imperialism was ultimately responsible for its own destruction '' why spend some 449 pages the other 98 of the book expounding the barbarian domino thesis then in fact earlier heather describes how germania was specifically and purposefully not taken into the roman empire because of the logistics and economics involved this is all described in a section beginning on page 55 does this sound like rome had complete and unbounded aggression moreover it was precisely because rome did not take these areas under its wing that the groups would arise that would eventually bring rome down heather speaks with rightful wonder of the great technical and social advances of the roman empire including everything from aqueducts to heating to roofing tiles but although heather does discuss the technical innovation of the hunnish bow that allowed the huns to be so successful in their predations he does n't make the ultimate conclusion the fall of the roman empire '' might quite correctly have made that conclusion would be it does n't matter how many bells and whistles a society has or does n't have the only thing that really matters is whether a society has a war machine that provides a distinct edge of course that 's not a very politically correct conclusion but it 's a thesis that is nicely explored in victor hanson 's carnage and culture landmark battles in the rise to western power '' all in all however i believe heather 's the fall of the roman empire '' to be a stunning achievement and highly recommend it
notice the title of peter heather 's fascinating study of the final centuries of the roman empire it is a clear tribute to gibbons yet the decline '' is intentionally missing because according to heather the roman empire never declined its fall was due to external rather then internal forces and the perpetrators were two the huns and the goths heather rejects the theories that see the cause of the fall of the roman empire in internal maladies contra popular opinion he argues that the division of the empire to western and eastern parts was rational given the increased size of the roman population as the roman way of life spread and more and more conquered people became roman citizens the patronage that had to be distributed became too enormous for any single imperial court hence the need for two courts nor is the fault in the christianization of the empire although he acknowledges that the rise of christianity brought a cultural revolution separation of the living from the dead equality of all before the lord diminished importance for the educated romans in comparison with the simple pp heather doubts it effected the functioning of the empire much the roman empire was still perceived as divinely blessed only the nomenclature was different '' 123 christian theology fitted neatly into roman chauvinism and it was only as consequences of defeat that augustine started to develop his theology pp the best evidence against the internal decline '' thesis is that the roman empire did not actually collapse only it 's western half did in the east the roman empire soldiered on until another powerful foreign threat islam therefore heather suggests the answer is external as a consequence of the exposure to the roman world the germanic tribes confronted by the romans have changed an agricultural revolution took over the german world increasing its population and changing its organization along with surplus there developed inequality with powerful leaders and kings solidifying larger and larger groups of barbarians '' pp but the grows of the german population was not in itself enough to shake and eventually to topple the western empire the fuse for that was a new menace coming from the east the huns heather remains officially agnostic as to the origin of the horse riding people from the great eurasian steppe although he seems to support the theory that their origin related to the a nomadic threat to the chinese empire several centuries before pp the huns made their ways into the neighborhood of the roman empire in two stages in the late century they have arrived at the caucasus and in the second quarter of the century to east and central europe culminating in the raids on the western empire by their sole unifier and greatest leader attila but it was not ultimately the huns who destroyed the empire what the huns did was trigger a chain reaction of migrating barbarians '' the greater richer and more unified germanic people who fled into the roman empire as germanic groups moved on to roman territory to escape hunnic aggression this long standing process acquired new momentum one of the most important phenomena of the fifth century narrative is that all of the major successor states to the west roman empire were created around the military power of new barbarian supergroups generated on the march '' 451 as the roman empire faced these threats it suffered from a vicious circle of damages the more the goths invaded the worse the empire 's capacity to raise taxes became thus turning the empire weaker and more tempting target the loss of africa to the vandals was a particularly hard stroke in that regard and every time the empire seemed to be able to overcome one crises the continued advanced of the huns pressed new waves of invaders into its boarders undoing the roman effort t he various crises faced by the western empire represented no more than the slow of the political consequence of the earlier invasions '' 434 this short synopsis does not come close to doing justice to heather 's sophisticated and fascinating account yet in blaming the fall on an exogenous shock '' 450 i think heather may be ignoring one major change in the roman empire its relative lack of belligerency as heather tells it roman expansion was driven by the internal power struggles of republican oligarchs and by the early emperor 's desire for glory '' but eventually the provinces that the empire started to conquer were just too poor to be worth conquering the roman advance ground to a halt around a major fault line of european organization '' it was not the military prowess of the germani that kept them outside the empire but their poverty '' pp but as the agriculture revolution took over the germanic world did not that arithmetic change if the roman empire 's border was initially determined on economic grounds it seems to have been perpetuated by tradition new threats lurked in the dark forests of germania but new opportunities were there as well why did n't the late empire move to take advantage of the opportunities to me it seems that an answer to that is essential for the discovery of the causes for the fall of the roman empire
this book discusses the last hundred years of the western roman empire to its fall having read many of the reviewers here i do n't think its worth while repeating the writer arguements so i will report my thoughts like many historians of that era the writer has a theory as to why rome fell although he makes some good arguments i do n't agree with two of his conclusions the first that the dramatic fall of the huns destroyed the balance of rome to the barbarians this is a real maybe as for the huns to keep the balance up would require that the huns military strength be much less then in attila 's days where they came close to bring rome down and that the huns agreed to act with rome what if they joined the barbarians in taking chunks of rome rome fall would have been accelerated the second is that roman imperialism was partly responsible for the growth of bigger groups of german barbarian tribes it may have had some affect but conversely roman policy was to try to keep these tribes apart although the writer did not go into much detail the german regions grew in power and wealth during this period so the relative difference between the rome and them was less larger groups tended to grow as the area got more populated and richer plus roman culture language and economy was providing a bridge bring these different peoples together just as rome was uniting the peoples inside the empire so she was uniting the peoples outside of the empire a similar effect is seen in other empires fringes anyway this caused all the demands on the military in the empire to go up soon rome could not afford it and fell several questions i would have liked to have been addressed was could rome have improved her economy and did rome make a mistake in not producing more mobile force as she had plenty of static forces that could be not used where required having said all of this from my own point of view although i have read many books on this subject i never realized just how much an affect the sasanians and the huns affected the empire also the effect of large land owners on the structure of the empire this book is extremely interesting and well worth reading
heather tells the complex story of the fall of the roman empire in a writing style so accessible that you feel like he is talking to you he clearly presents his thesis oversimplification there was no decline '' there was a loss in revenue when north africa was lost barbarians eroded the western empire and a disasterous armada to get africa back nailed the coffin so that lay people can understand it when he presents evidence he also notes what is missing from the evidence or how it might be this way we know how he came to his conclusion leaving the door open for future discoveries heather the editor and publisher oxford university press have done their team work the maps are excellent and they are placed with the text they illustrate there are referals to a previous pages something you rarely see since books are routinely published in such haste that this is not possible the biographies of people and peoples in the back help you keep the players straight heather says a full study of what happened in the provinces is worth another book i hope heather writes it
this magnificent book is accessible to the history buff or general reader and provides an extensive logical and easy to read account of all that went wrong in the last hundred years of the western roman empire heather 's extensive research combined with attention to detail has produced a brilliant well argued revisionist account of why the empire eventually fell to the barbarians essentially the volume of the various incursions of barbarians from the late century ad was too much for the western empire to sustain and gradually wore it down heather is able to clarify the external and internal reasons why the empire was worn down by the barbarians the empire was still prosperous with an army but it was not enough to withstand the series of invasions heather provides a good explanation of why the western roman empire army was much less formidable after the defeat at hadrianople from reading gibbon l thought that stilicho was the last great general of the western roman empire not so l enjoyed the account of the life of the general and consul flavius aetius heather is able to transport the reader back in time and bring ancient persons back to life so l was able to imagine the political and social environment they lived in heather also explains why the end of the western roman empire was not a certain event and how it could have remained viable the final nail in the coffin was the failed attempt to invade north africa in 468 ad to regain land lost to the vandals the author 's last paragraph in the book is brilliant and challenging but l will not reveal it to spoil the effect for anybody else
peter heather 's the fall of the roman empire is an exciting book because it peels away the theories of the fall of the roman empire and replaces them with a logical coherent theory of what happened for some reason known only to my shrink i am a fan of the roman empire and so while reading the fall of the roman empire i kept rooting for the romans to win hoping that the conclusion might turn out differently and the empire would survive but alas it did not still it 's that kind of book it reads like a novel with clear prose the next time you travel to hungary think of attila the hun whose fierce huns wielding deadly bows that could pierce armor from horseback a yards distant smacked into the germanic tribes to the west and sent them carooming like billiard balls across the roman frontier i wo n't spoil any more of the plot for you because this and entertaining book deserves your full ruminations there are 16 maps and the many footnotes are tucked away in the end papers out of sight the fall is a narrative that makes the political economic military and social aspects of the fourth and fifth centuries seem like they happened yesterday and that the romans of these times whose orderly world was slowly unraveling into a kind of chaotic darkness were people much like you and i struggling to save their way of life in vexing dangerous times
it 's quite difficult to write a comprehensive and understandable narrative of the years leading up to the end of the roman empire in the west because of the paucity of contemporary sources and the potential inaccuracy of those sources from folowing centuries this author has taken what he feels are the accurate parts of the sources available and combined them with the best of historical roman scholarship and written a book that covers the years involved and covers them quite well often histories of the distant past tend to be difficult to comprehend to the average reader but this book keeps the knowledge level just about perfect you will learn more about the last years of the western empire than you probably knew before and you will learn in an easy to understand manner the author makes the past come alive and that 's what good histporical writing is all about
the fall of the roman empire a new history of rome and the barbarians by peter heather this new book by a professor at worcester college university of oxford is a true gem among books covering historical subject matter the past when covered by most books attempting to educate the reader on historical subject matter covering several hundred years often results in text book like reading without the inspirational individual efforts of the everyday citizen being included or explained in this case i am happy to report that not only are many individual citizens brought to life through recovered letters and such but many connecting aspects of interpersonal rivalries and ambitions supported by empirical evidence are interspaced with the big picture events surrounding those people and their lives this book makes the reader more aware of the issues and subject matter from the view of the small group or individual than any other book on rome which i am familiar with the writing is also easy to follow for the average reader who is not a scholar if you are interested in finding out just how similar our world events today are to ancient rome and the issues they faced read this book ! rome faced many of the same issue as we see today examples of these issues include inflation of coinage by deflating the value of the raw metal content in the coins gorilla warfare on its boarders political intrigue through spies by rival super powers citizens who were forced to deal with changing events rapidly if they wanted to start a business or venture into government work among many other examples heather argues in my opinion very successfully that it was the barbarians who brought down the empire rather than any social or moral collapse however the real value of this book is for the average reader to dive into something which reads like a fiction narrative trying to persuade the reader to a point of view in my opinion it succeeds however the average reader can learn so much on this subject matter without subjecting themselves to the many long and boring textbooks which are so abundant for any topic related to rome and its downfall at 459 pages just for the story and persuasive argument for his theme heather adds a timeline and other sources as well making the total page count 572. in my experience this book reads like a page turner and should engage any history buff as well as those who shun history for its boring nature or lack of inspired stories to engage in and root for the characters that heather has pass in and out of rome 's history in this detailed book seem real and alive books on rome are abundant but few engage the average reader in a way that compels and engages the imagination while failing to debase the story in the usual folly of solely telling everything from the view of the top person looking down on the minions rome had entrepreneurs and businessmen between the gladiators and slaves and emperors who knew that so many parallels to our modern western civilization would be seen through one book read this book for the entertainment as well as the educational value relating to a civilization which still reaches forward in time to spread its influence on today 's world events whether you are interested in the development of the germanic peoples influencing rome and how they continue to influence us up to today or your interests lie with an early cult of judaism as it emerged from a leadership dominated by martyrs to become the dominant religion of the empire despite its founder being publicly executed by the same empire this book will put into perspective all of the issues of that time period in a way that is engaging and relevant to digest for the modern westerner this book was fun entertaining and engaging i highly recommend it
there is no getting away from the noun 'mind ' it is perfectly intelligible and sensible to say that newton hume and richard bentley had fine minds however we soon get into a muddle when we misunderstand what kind of noun 'mind ' is people possess certain capacities that we call 'mental ' by way of distinguishing them from capacities of the senses such as eyesight or from capacities of the physique like and anything that is ' is of the mind and immediately we have to watch our step if we want to think clearly bentley bentley 's eyes and bentley 's eyesight can each be said to have had the capacity to read the text of manilius bentley and bentley 's eyes but not bentley 's eyesight can each be said to have read manilius however what enabled bentley to correct and edit the text of manilius was his mind but bentley 's mind did n't edit manilius bentley did there is no such thing as a mind ryle argues if i do n't misrepresent him as distinct from things that are of the mind there is an intelligible entity called a body that we recognise as distinct from any and all of its attributes the mind is nothing except certain capacities and the noun 'mind ' is the convenient way of referring to these it is not the same sort of thing as eyesight or hearing but belongs in the same category of noun as ' or ' epistemology like this is often described as the study of knowledge but it would be better described as the study of understanding its aim is to clarify what we think and how we think and it takes as its basis the way we use language in ordinary utterance ryle 's book was highly influential in its day and it seems to have retained the status of a kind of classic over the years since i last read it if so it thoroughly deserves this status linguistic philosophy of the kind predominantly associated with oxford can and does sometimes degenerate into what denis healey unkindly called ' however in my own opinion it rescued theoretical philosophy from some strange aberrations that had been treated with a respect they did not deserve and which had confused earnest seekers after truth in a way they did not deserve either speech is the main medium of human communication and we need to think carefully about how we use it if we want to advance to higher levels of theoretical understanding examining the use of words on their own is part of the trick but even more important is sensitivity to how they are used in varying contexts and surprisingly often the most important thing of all is to consider what the implied alternative may be russell illustrated this point wittily when deciding on the title of a book of essays that he thought too heavyweight to be described as ' not popular '' then unpopular '' ' he reasoned speciously so essays ' they became the book is laid out in a very schematic way with chapters and dedicated to individual topics this makes it very convenient for students with an essay to write on this or that topic that the book addresses experto credite and similarly will make it easy for the modern reader to consult almost as a i should say that the best way to read it is to work through the entire first half or thereabouts and select as desired from there on by through an attentive reader will have got the hang of the type of thinking it enshrines if he or she is going to get it at all for me the most interesting topic other than the mind itself was free will ryle is even a trifle summary in his treatment of this but finds the argument about free will to be a and so do what might will be do you suppose there can be enforced actions but not enforced wishes my own guess is that will ' is often confused in practice with free choice there can be enforced choices in one sense the performative sense of selecting more commonly it 's a matter of one 's choice being thwarted as when my preferred brand of is not in the shop when i go for it or of my own deliberate act of choosing a if i think the price being charged for my first choice is too high the other confusion is with some supposed inevitability or by which it is supposed that nothing our will and our choices included could have happened otherwise this seems to me to be true only in the trivial sense that nothing that has happened can be other than what it was the answers to the question ' i choose a certain kind of are usually several and straightforward i like the flavour it contains vitamins etc the answer to the question ' one chooses anything is more obscure so obscure that i do n't even know what it 's asking the book is maybe a little too long but i think if so that that 's because it is partly a great manifesto of a certain type of thinking partly in its later stages something that degenerates slightly into a bit of a a lot of topics get covered and some descartes are slain while some real giants hume are put in their place too i have no real difficulty with ryle 's view that self ' will be better understood from the uses of ' than the way hume went about it i also probably agree that whatever the deficiencies of ' it had the benefit of showing up the greater deficiencies of arguments resting on ' i just hope he does n't sweep aside with the latter plato 's doctrine of the forms which i like russell take as quite literally true whatever this book is all about how to think not what to think
gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor on page 16 he writes a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries department buildings and museums then he asks but where is the university '' this is the category mistake '' cartesian question where is the mind '' has a same confusion he asserts a famous epigram ghost in the machine '' is sometimes misinterpreted his point is that there is no ghost '' what we think ghost spirit does not exist therefore ghost ! although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism the british school represented by wittgenstein and ryle had an its apogee in 50 's its crux of reasoning still has an important element i still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic
gilbert ryle wrote this classic exposition on the problem in philosophy with a view to dissipate a myth fundamental to religion and philosophy his cogent exposition leads us to see mind in persons as other than a ghost in a machine '' more than this though his comprehensive scrutiny of the many elements of the life of the mind constitutes an incisive study of the synergy of mind and body in an integrated life ryle exercises consummate skill in avoiding technical jargon to present a refreshing style for treatment of a difficult and elusive subject one of his favorite analogies is to compare a study of thinking as like trying to catch a jellyfish with a fine hook '' a thoughtful and careful reader will revel in ryle 's success with his daunting task
in a sense this book is a mirror to the problems covered in wittgenstein 's philosophical investigations '' albeit with tighter arguments and far less meandering than wittgenstein 's groundbreaking work this was published three years before wittgenstein 's posthumous pi both men were dedicated to freeing philosophy from what ryle terms category errors '' misapplications of the ordinary referential scope of a given term mind '' as a concept which must necessarily oppose substance '' for instance this duality forces us to ascribe and essentialize qualities to the incorporeal along the same lines as that of substance by giving it attributes on the linguistic model of physical objects these misapplications have led philosophers into vast problems which by their very nature as linguistic misuses are unsolvable but not parts of it will provoke cries of behaviorism ! but ryle included a chapter near the end distancing his stance from skinner et al how well he manages in this is debatable ! brilliant straightforward and elegant this is one the best works of philosophy
