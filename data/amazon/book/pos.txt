sphere by michael crichton is an excellant novel this was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the crichton novels that i have read the story revolves around a man named norman johnson johnson is a phycologist he travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the pacific ocean to help the navy in a top secret misssion they quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship the civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft they are joined by 5 navy personel to help them run operations however on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave the team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean after a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an american ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth this novel does not have the research that some of the other crichton novels have but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis i would strongly recommend this book
oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation he describes how he combines complementary medicine hypnosis reflexology yoga message acupuncture etc with orthodox western medicine there is an excellent forward by dr dean ornish and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques the bulk of the book contains stories of patients oz treated using this revolutionary way i am a cardiologist and i have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine which is the reason i bought this book however this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment nevertheless those interested in this new medicine which i think will be the medicine of the new millennium will want to read this book

this book is for lovers of robicheaux his demons seem put to rest redemption seems almost within his grasp and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages the poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade burke 's prose as always but his anger at humanity 's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface hurricane katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing a bit like robicheaux himsel
this is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length i want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful engaging and thought provoking story this book packs the punch of great fiction it covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic you certainly do n't need to be a history major biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author jared diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations i think the major shortcoming of his work is that he does n't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history if you do n't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture the need for armies etc you will find this fascinating reading if you have a deep knowledge of these areas anthropology and sociology you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying however most likely you will enjoy the story if you can keep in mind that it does n't provide the full picture in short this book magnificently illuminates jared diamond 's specific areas of interest while downplaying or neglecting others it provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner
since i am a world 's fair fanatic '' i have read almost everything that i can on the subject in general this is an interesting and well researched book the author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about however i must point up three rather glaring errors in the book in describing the louisiana world expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be 80 feet tall just 150 feet shorter than the eiffel tower '' since the eiffel tower is actually over 900 feet tall the new orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet may have been a typo which the author did not catch in other error states that the us pavilion at the brussels world 's fair of 1958 was a large squat round concrete block structure '' it was indeed large and round but not squat and not made of concrete to the excellent book about edward durrell stone the architect of the pavilion the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light i have seen photos of the us pavilion and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me in comparison to the soviet pavilion which resembled a large refrigerator ! thirdly the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the exhibited at a expo they had a large pavilion at the new york world 's fair of 1939. all in all however i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world 's fairs
this the one book that taught me more about how to use my slr than the camera 's manual itself the step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography i also liked the way frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter one take without the filter and then the same one with a filter also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field an encompassing book the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment the peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown a good buy and money well spent my only gripe is that i preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
tom friedman is a engaging writer he also writes from a very personal perspective both as to how the world has changed for him and his family and for his friends around the world you get the feeling that friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching what a treat and a very easy read pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the us shores
john crowley 's recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the english language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980 's his great work of time '' is an intriguing time travel fantasy about cecil rhodes and british economic imperialism in east africa at the end of the and beginning of the centuries it was almost as compelling a read as the the nightingale sings at night '' which offers a fantastical twist on the adam and eve creation myth saga the other two tales in blue '' and novelty '' i found much less compelling but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose crowley uses in other tales it was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library a surprise which i think many readers will also discover
this story captivated me right from the outset as vivian copes with loss of memory her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail and she is a very realistically portrayed as susannah packs up her childhood home and prepares to move vivian into an assisted living apartment she uncovers clues to her past concerning the mysteries of her brother 's death and whereabouts of her sweetheart with just the right blend of drama action suspense and resolution of family issues this enjoyable story is very uplifting and providing reflections for my own midlife crisises it is easily read within a couple of hours and there is a subtle to the blossom street books leaving the possibility that these likable characters may reappear in subsequent books in that series
i found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk i visit at least once every summer i love going there and looking to see if i can find a book that i have never heard of by an author i 've never heard of and buy it on a whim this is the novel i bought last year i has unfortunately sat on my shelf since then until tonight because of many reasons tonight however i picked it up and read it cover to cover the narrative was brilliantly told the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching if i had made it to the end without some tears i would believe myself made of stone ! skip is a character many can relate to a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out down about how his friends have really not been friends at all that gets the chance to do something great by this little child however it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the blessings of the title faith a name not used lightly restores her namesake in all those touched by her she ultimately gives him the chance of making something of his life without even knowing it many blessings occur in this wonderful novel and i found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times but also proud at how humankind can be at others which is a fact in itself that proves how well quindlen has spun her tale the fact is that just because a person has been to jail has deadbeat friends does not mean he is of that same stock just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her skip lydia nadine meredith jennifer all have many dimentions to their characters that quindlen has spectacularly drawn
i checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as i cracked it open i knew i needed a copy of my own it is full of simple tasty and easy to prepare recipes i really like how most of the recipes do n't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are i was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence i 'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine
i sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america in absolute awe ! with almost 200 contributors almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations editor andy smith and oxford university press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken whether you are a food professional or interested amateur a historian sociologist or anthropologist a student or scholar these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in america the scope is astounding spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products from ethnic religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in american history and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in america despite the enormity of this work it is refreshingly approachable set forth alphabetically written in clear language translated when needed and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further as a food developer food writer and culinary is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive

while expertly crafted this is not a pretty novel nor is it gentle the subject matter abduction of a child is somber as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying the plot twists and turns as befits a lehane novel and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying but you can usually trust lehane to take good care of you in this one of his finer books and not only are there plot twists to wrestle with there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head all in all this was a solid enjoyable thriller the reader will feel his time was not wasted
awesome this book is worth its weight in gold for the insights and understanding it shares with a professional background in finance economics and a profound study of the word of god the author is well qualified to expose mammon for what it is and to challenge the reader to a deeper surrender to the only real treasure worth having buy two and give a copy away can we have a new edition please
this book does something i 've never seen before it shows a cool young homo boy who 's punk rock and a skater not some wishwashy sam the lead character is really cool i 'd like to be his friend and his boyfriend but that 's another matter also the dude he likes clay is really hot he 's a surfer but he 's not a stereotypical surfer he 's much cooler and also a little punk rock i love this novel the ending is really sad but i loved it
fear nothing is about christopher snow whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways but chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is and even that his little town of moonlight bay is stranger and scarier than he thought chris then sets out with his friends and his dog to find out the truth about what 's really going on fear nothing is a good plot written in typical koontz style fear nothing grabs you from the beginning and holds you all the way through it keeps you guessing and just when you think you have it figured out it throws something new at you and makes you guess some more koontz creates some very likable characters and by the end of the story you like them and feel as if you know them fear nothing is very descriptive koontz describes his locations so well you feel like you 're in them and experiencing the plot right next to the main character i have not read the sequel but i am anxious to do so
i 'm not even a vegetarian let alone a vegan and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait ! unless you hate veggies this book is a must have ! i just made the herb scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right it 's hard to believe there 's no cheese or cream ! the pizza with caramelized onions kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too ! of yummyness
very good easy light funny read ! although his best by far in my opinion was running with scissors '' this was an enjoyable read would recommend reading his work if you like david sedaris both have a similiar style
reading this book is like having a holy vision i feel as if i should tell the world about it but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe i should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me into my life into my head the book is the story of billy parham a son in a new mexican ranching family billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father 's cattle but realizes he ca n't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old mexico billy crosses the border into mexico and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams where everyone moves as if the air was liquid where every ruin has an irretrievable story where soot and heat and danger hang in the air and where nothing ever goes as planned the story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor all the pretty horses '' but that 's not necessarily a shortcoming the book sprawls out like a wide hot desert curling north and south east and west across the present and into the past the writing is as good as any writing i 've ever read ever and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years for example the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth this is a book that needs to be read pick it up and let it seep into your skin let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas and let it change you let it open your eyes to the world and to the west and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us this is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just ca n't put into words but here somehow cormac mccarthy has managed to do just that here is the intangible but tangible here is the unnameable but named here are the thoughts you could never express expressed
beautiful vineyards fueding families mystery and an unlikely love story with a twist great read prepare to read this one through because it was hard to put down ! ! !

as i read i kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it 's just a good tale peppered with strong political images and a good story it is how can you beat this writing the pandits of kashmir were left to rot in their slum camps to rot while the army and the insurgency fought over the bloodied and broken valley to dream of return to die while dreaming of return to die after the dream of reture died so that they could not even die dreaming of it why was that why as that why was that why was that why was that '' 297 '' the beauty approached him beckoning her arm slipped around his shoulder supple as a snake and like a snake her leg coiled around his then like a third snake her other arm and like a fourth snake her other leg until she was slithering all over him she had as many arms and legs as a goddess and multilimbed and irrestible she coiled and tightened around him and finally with all the power she possessed she bit the accidental death by king cobra snakebit of the general was announced the next morning and he was buried with full honors 316 '' 31

still a great read but not as good as tender at the bone and comfort me with apples foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom dad and other relatives and friends the highs are not as high nor the lows as low in garlic and sapphires reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader that said i hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book
very good writing done by both authors i 've always loved now with du brul the story gets even more suspenseful a really awsome page turner get this one
this is most definitely my favorite book on earth ! i 'm so serious this is such a cool book it really appeals to anyone kids could read it because there are short sentances and pictures some tough words though start with epiplectic but teens and adults i 'm sure can also appreciate the morbid and brilliant humor of edward gorey for anyone that thinks that 10 is too much to spend on a little book you may be right in some circumstances but this is such a fantastic book i know i am gushing but i love it soooooooo much ! ! !
even though you know before you start reading that this book will have a happy ending it is a fun read a well written and pleasant book one of the best of this falls crop i am already waiting for the next book in the series
i found this book to contain some really sound advice and i would suggest it for anyone that was contemplating risking their money on the ponies
this was the first novel i read from endo and i have to confess to being hooked on it from the first it is both interesting from a historical perspective taking in an event that was singularly fascinating and deeply profound from a psychological perspective it is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day hasekura is a deep character and the reader spends a bit of time with hasekura 's thoughts this is especially so as hasekura confronts the emaciated dying christ that he sees on his travels toward rome the possibility of faith in this pathetic man '' and the conflict that produces with his duty to lord and ancestors forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with hasekura 's desires dreams and simple wishes the psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact a notable part of the book is tied up with father velasco whose ambition seems to know no limits his own struggles with ambition and the that he employs are a lesson worthy of remembering this novel is a great one and i was hooked to the very last page it will take you into the world of hasekura velasco and their companions as they themselves see it it will take you into their dreams their hopes their fatalism their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation i totally unreservedly recommend this novel i love this novel
i was given this book by a friend as a going away gift the day i decided to read it i was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting i was a bit drowsy but i could not but it down it made me nervous excited sad and happy all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
dry is anything but what the title of this work pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on augusten burroughs must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction the writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth funny yet foreboding and in its clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it especially the limited usefulness of story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call a hard core drinker '' as he anticipates the next one '' describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas job and sexual is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle yet has a strong earlier work 'running with scissors ' was apparently good enough for hollywood so take a shot with all when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do it might be time to slow down stop and get a copy of twelve steps and twelve traditions and a copy of dry cheers ! !

whilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget which colours match which accessories never date and how to dress for evening functions of any nature i highly recommend it for anyone who thinks jackie kennedy was the epitome of chic and who would like to know how to pull it off themselves
the quirky illustrations done by the masterful dave mckean at once contribute to the book 's charm but also lend to its dread however this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares some people may not appreciate dave mckean 's artwork as much as they should because it is so different at least to those not familiar with the sandman graphic novel series written by neil gaiman in which dave mckean did the cover art for all the books at first glance the layout might seem confusing even distracting yet it somehow works here neil gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing he introduces us to a charming young girl named lucy who suspects something is not right with her home and though her seems to share her concern and understands her fear the rest of her family do not until it 's too late the action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end though perhaps it is not you be the judge this is a worthy book to read to and above though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern neil gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience one so unfamiliar with his other work i highly recommend this book

this is the story of another tragic episode involving a native american tribe that this probably happened under other circumstances and happened to more than the arapaho tribe can not be doubted this is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more the characters are strong believable and you want the best for all of them the underlying plot selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died is heartbreaking the reunion of one such child with her father made me weep and vicki 's trial reconciliation with ben gave me hope this is a great work written with deep feeling
this book was extremely well written it 's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all what totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time i have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20 's she most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end for example on page 233 and if all the gifts of life are good perhaps too are all the shapes she chooses to take and which we can not alter '' the book is filled with hints at the time period even though after looking at countless reviews the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that did not and it was a fantastical '' piece of literature in my opinion this book was totally based on the time period there 's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he 's not white '' anymore he has come down in the world if you 're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20 's this is an astounding piece
my husband bought this book for me and i have to say it is not a book i would normally pick up i also have to say i loved it ! it was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way i enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer

this rather strangely titled book is a tribute to the demand for elizabeth bishop 's work it is a set of pieces gleaned from some pages in the vassar college library collection not exactly random but almost here are 108 poems some prose notes she took some sketches some facimilies of her papers some sketches she made and other pieces harder to describe obviously this is a book that will appeal most to people who are already elizabeth bishop fans this is more of a work in process it tells more about her as a person it illustrates the great effort she went to get her poems just right before sending them off for publication it shows something of the way her mind worked the work here is not bishop 's best it 's unfinished some of the shorter pieces fragments really make you wonder where she might have taken it
this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it it is warm and comforting a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter
my fav essay was about the '' river also now when watching the evening news the link between fire and flood makes alot of sense thanks for the enlightenment
i was a reasonably big fan of the wizard of oz '' when i was a kid i 'd seen the judy garland film the return to oz '' film my parents had taken me to a theatre production and there used to be a cartoon series about dorothy and her friends that i quite liked here in australia though you do n't see an awful lot of the wizard of oz books and i missed out on all that as a kid i managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story and i really liked it it 's really a shame i could n't find it earlier dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of kansas in the midst of a cyclone '' dorothy her dog toto and her whole house are swept away to the land of oz a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures good and bad witches and a very famous wizard dorothy tries to find her way home and on the way makes many new friends like the scarecrow tin woodsman '' and the cowardly lion will she ever make it home it 's rather different to the movie i found for one the journey dorothy and her friends go on takes many days whereas the in the judy garland film it seems to all take place much shorter the magic shoes dorothy picks up in oz are silver here and not ruby red like in the film there are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book like the queen of the mice the hammerheads and the dainty china people though the world of oz seems pretty big in the film it feels a lot bigger to me in the book oz has a nice atmosphere too i thought it 's very cosy and familiar and kind of evokes a kind of america the way that say lewis and tolkien evokes a kind of britain if that makes any sense north south east west in oz 's every direction there 's a new land to explore you never know who you might meet or how they 'll do things there i quite like how laid back everyone is in oz the way the munchkins and the people of the emerald city speak for instance i enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too like how the tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west which is all described here that reminds me there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here but nothing worse than you might find in little red riding hood '' all in all a great read i thought whimsical colourful and fun i do hope i can get my hands on some of the follow up books good thing there 's amazon

we know some things about saul of tarsus later named the apostle paul but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information most everything we know from paul is from the luke in the book of acts or paul 's epistles themselves ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements peter in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom validates paul 's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them pollock 's book is presented as reading since paul 's complete biography is not entirely clear there is much the author states is inference or speculation if you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy i think this is an excellent book one example of fuzzy '' facts that pollock considers is the controversy over the authorship of the book of hebrews the author of hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it pollock speculates that paul while imprisioned in acts ch 24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach with his imprisonment and his controversial style among the jews he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his jewish brothers eternity will reveal who wrote the book of hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory overall the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed
i 've been reading a chapter a day for over a it 's a great motivator for the day ahead i 've found this translation to be the best i 've read other translations have been boring or too dense this one was very powerful
this is the first novel by philip roth that i actually like portnoy 's complaint was a good novella spread out over a page book the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions and his kvetching about his parents operation shylock was also too with pushing a political agenda but just what agenda we are never sure this is roth 's primary fault as an author he is too didactic i find that i really do n't care much about what roth 's political opinions are ironically this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling it shows that he thinks deep thoughts '' the professor of desire is blessedly free of politics in it roth sticks with the subjects he knows best sex and relationships young david kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student that changes while studying abroad in swinging london where he finds that what they say about swedish girls is true things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in new york with the help of a psychiatrist kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness the professor of desire finds roth at a more mature place in his career gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of portnoy 's complaint the parents in this book are treated with sympathy at one point a character points out to kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a jewish family for his fiction anymore he is also less homophobic in this novel but not much so there are still things about roth 's style that take getting used to i do n't think there 's anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking however the professor of desire is a short lyrical novel that is the best of anything i 've read of his so far
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
if you want to buy the book go ahead just be careful of superbookdeals they take your money but do n't deliver and do n't answer emails caveat emptor
hugh hewitt is right on target encouraging republicans to remain loyal to president george bush we are confronted with a long term fight against islamic nihilists the democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the indeed if the democratic party returns to power the war on terror will be severely compromised not lost even theological modernists like myself recognize that the republican party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order and yes we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like senator lincoln chafee but what about the republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands these folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006. many of them possess a suicidal nietzschean streak in their heart of hearts they idiotically believe we should let the democrats win so that the republican party can be purified '' the author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis hopefully he starts to do so real soon before it 's too late the crybaby republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue a number of them come across as nativists who despise hispanics we can not however forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often american citizens they get to vote at the age of 18 will most certainly seek revenge on the gop for harassing their parents let 's get something straight we are also not going to send an estimated million people back to their original homeland but are n't these individuals breaking the law human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required i may have a few complaints about hugh hewitt 's newest book still you need to purchase a copy his overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the united states from ruin david thomson flares into darkness
just when you think you 've got gemmell figured out he turns the tables on you fans of gemmell and jon shannow might find the book a bit slow at first and something of a retread of previous jerusalem man tales but be patient the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve ! readers unfamiliar with shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous stones of power books before this one you wo n't be disappointed gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late century

this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row '' at least in the state of mississippi and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row '' the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain i found it to be one of the better john grisham books
i just finished the book today and i will start out by saynig that this is a very good read i will not spoil the plot if you have not read this book oh and this book is not scary but it really is creepy give it a go
this is wonderful ! it is for fans of laura ingalls wilder and also for those who are interested in historic cooking from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled america in the early days and adapted for use there this book is a very happy blend of the laura ingalls stories and the food which was eaten interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked of course laura did n't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day it has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures i found this book so lovely to read through not just browse through the interest factor is great learning what things were available and how they were used baking soda yeasts how the oven was used what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget seasonal food avaialble but it is good as a simple recipe book it is an incredible look at times gome past one of my best reads in the last few years i also bought a prairie cookbook which i would highly recommend as well it is more of a recipe book than this one but a lovely complementary book to it
we would expect a well balanced approach to writing about the work of the holy spirit in the church by the author who also wrote tyranny of the urgent '' and we get it ! in this book charles hummel former president of intervarsity christian fellowship first reviews the history and growth of the various charismatic groups within both the protestant and catholic churches he provides many valuable explanations of the meaning of related scriptures as well as observations of healings and prophecies that he himself has seen he later gives his recommendations for keeping the holy spirit fire in the fireplace '' of a biblical church body i came away encouraged in my own spiritual gifts and reminded that the more extraordinary spirit gifts have not disappeared and that to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
i 'd definitely recommend it not only to the knowledge management professionals but to the general public it 's a fun and easy read
blanchard and hybels and hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a christian point of view while reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership they put together an excellent framework for leadership the summary checklist given on pp offer a helpful concise summary of the book the glaring omission and one that i ca n't believe that hybels would make is to clearly point out that following jesus ' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with jesus in other words you ca n't lead like jesus if you do n't have him in your life to help you i ca n't believe that there was n't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further i believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book but for the christian it is an excellent book
many novels of the experience in the united states use the theme of passing '' these novels generally involve a who can pass '' for white among other things novels based on a theme of passing '' allow the character and the author to comment upon relationships in the united states from both sides from the black experience and from the white experience both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of passing '' the earliest novel involving passing '' of which i am aware is by william dean howells in his short 1891 book an imperative duty '' which dealt with an marriage the novelist nella larsen wrote a novel titled passing '' set in the harlem renaissance more recently philip roth 's novel the human stain '' involves the story of professor coleman silk a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white coleman silk is the successor to the protagonist of james weldon johnson 's only novel the autobiography of an man '' written in 1912. the unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual like roth 's character coleman silk with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an apparently white person and his strong sense of black identity like coleman silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of passing '' johnson 's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an johnson 's short novel is to my mind the best written on the theme of passing '' and it is a fine novel indeed the book initially was published anonymously the writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914. many years later johnson wrote his own autobiography titled along this way '' in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the autobiography '' johnson 's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth both internally and in the outward events of life about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world he ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy in addition to the story line of the book johnson uses the passing '' theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the united states early in the century the most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a smoking car '' for whites on a train in the segregated south he participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the race question '' as it was viewed at the time there is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching the burning alive of a black person johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of legislation in congress but johnson 's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues the book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth century america in the south and in johnson 's beloved new york city the book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both south and north it is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music most strikingly the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared johnson shows great appreciation for this product of american culture the book also illustrates some universal themes the protagonist is troubled specifically by the conflict between his identity as an and his wish to succeed as a white person but the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of the role of chance in human life and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of passing '' johnson 's novel is an important work of american fiction which deserves to be read
you the reader are the subject and the hero of calvino 's novel an exercise in theory gone mad calvino 's lively experiment begins by describing a reader that is you '' reading calvino 's novel and after this opening you '' settle in to read the novel that you were meant '' to be reading a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter but all is not fair in the land of fiction the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely after several tricks and machinations you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books written in ten different styles yet all sharing place and character names and even themes part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated the most obvious segments mock borges dostoevsky and chekhov while initially it seems that calvino assumes you are male soon you are introduced to the other reader and you '' see the story through her eyes both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you the book alternates between the story fragments and the story of you '' the repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling you ca n't get your bearings the characters have changed the settings you do n't understand what it 's about you find names of people and do n't know who they are '' it 's a bit like groundhog day '' except that instead of being stuck inside the same day you 're doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus well before the end of the novel you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies mysteries fantasies and romances that you desperately try and fail to finish but in the story of your reading experience itself an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the other reader a reclusive popular writer a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer 's name a sloppy and conniving translator and various officials of repressive dictatorships for the reader who does n't mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind calvino 's novel can be pure fun the success of calvino 's task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book i know that some readers find some of these passages alien that 's not how i read books '' but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar this reader too found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half later in the book the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates repressive governments and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle and the solution '' to the puzzle although fitting has the oomph of the finale to a story no matter if you enjoy metafiction you might just recognize yourself in this clever book
this is my all time favorite book ! i have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book it is definately one of nicholas sparks bests
deadly feasts tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book it tracks the discovery of prions the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease scrapie and creutzfeldt jacob disease following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the century on rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school to the scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were but this is n't just a story of scientific discovery as the foreboding subtitle blares rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions these include spontaneous formation responsible for the known early cases of creutzfeldt jacob disease infection including mad cow disease and scrapie the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response and hardiness of the disease one scary factoid a scientist took a sample of scrapie froze it baked it for an hour at 360 degrees celsius and was able to other animals from this sample for all the uneasiness this book inspires it certainly does n't offer any answers a condemnation of industrial agriculture a warning that it 's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue to be fair it was printed in 1997 perhaps things are under control now
this book was very candid and well written it shows that bob primary goal was to build a business and become rich and he succeed the idea that he sold it as a media for african american pride is what got him in trouble pulley shows that it was strictly business '' johnson need not so defensive what he created made him rich this book shows that wealth does not equal respect nevertheless he has 3 billion dollars and hopefully plenty of time to write a final chapter of which he can be prou

having spent the last year in the near east i found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues while this book was written about the issue during the 's though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months it was as i said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture with the world attention squarely on the near east we all weather american european or other cultures throughout the world need to know and understand the near eastern mentality culture and to some extend how the islamic religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area with this book being written by a jewish american and with thomas freidman 's understanding of the near east way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for i recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the near east politicians and military personnel religious leaders and anyone who wants a better understanding of the near east in general

this is not a book about management it is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals it sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens what i got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well if you want the other side irving janis ' old classic on groupthink is a good counterpoint unlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable it is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas

with dead watch '' sanford has delivered a political thriller that is fully worthy of mention alongside his popular prey series i share the booklist reviewer 's sentiment that sandford has produced a intrigue reminiscent of ross thomas a very good thing ! my biggest beef with dead watch is the bland characterization of jake winter though sandford does do a good job of making winter not be lucas davenport nearly every other character has more not to worry though the madison bowe character and the breakneck speed of the story more than make up for that shortcoming if i 'd been turning pages any faster i 'd have probably started a fire
charlie bone is n't your typical boy although he did n't know that himself but when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever tracking down the picture charlie finds out it belongs to miss ingledew a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years she gives charlie a mysterious package that he ca n't open and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world as it turns out charlie is one of the descendants of the red king a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding the red king 's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since at bloor 's academy charlie finds friends and enemies and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others do n't want revealed jenny nimmo is the author of five books in the charlie bone series and has written several other children 's books and fantasies many people compare charlie bone to harry potter and that 's a good comparison but the two series are different harry 's family is really but charlie has a loving mother a doting grandmother and uncle paton who turns out to be something of a hero the book is a fun whirlwind of mysteries magic and friendship even at 400 pages it feels like it 's over much too soon there are a few jarring instances where the was disconnected moving from one character and one scene into another without warning they were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story but noticeable all the same fans who are waiting for the next harry potter book who have n't tried the charlie bone series are encouraged to do so charlie 's story although similar has much to offer in reading excitement
this book sucks very badly ! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place ! !
bones is a very special dog a dog who understands ingloosh and almost speaks it a dog who is happy roaming about the country with his master willie christmas if willie is homeless probably schizophrenic certainly eccentric if they rarely have enough to eat if he does n't always understand willie 's metaphysical ramblings what does that matter between a dog and his best friend alas in the first chapter willie is coughing up blood and bones knows that willie is going to die the entire story is told through the point of view of this remarkable dog is it the story of a dog or the story of willie or the story of life in america or a story about love alienation betrayal and loss well it 's all of these and what is timbuktu for that you will have to read the book i 'm not going to tell you author paul auster is a genius with language somehow he draws you into this improbable story and makes it believable more than believable compelling does he really get inside the mind of a dog who am i to say i can only say that for me he makes the mind of a dog as believable and understandable as any other mind some reviewers expressed disappointment with this book but i thought it was wonderful just let it speak in its own voice and take it for what it is and you will love it i recommend timbuktu highly reviewed by louis gruber

i saw the second title of this series at my local borders bookstore and decided to try the first title do not be fooled by the young adult '' category this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read though a little adolescent at times this novel is still excellent and i recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy
when peter lynch speaks wise investors will listen this book covers the famous fund manager 's career at the helm of fidelity magellan from 1977 to and post career into it 's far more introspective than one up on wall street '' and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose for example there is n't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former my belief is that the reader would do best by reading one up on wall street '' first and follow up with this title as its the newer of the two regardless peter 's style of writing with john rothchild is and easy to take in to my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry the reader can comfortably take in some very important principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point i think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that is n't child 's play unless you like playing with money and although this book does n't cover nearly as much technical information as the first it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers i made plenty of notes while reading beating the street '' and i 'm confident that i 'll be well served by doing so peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower than their growth rates overall this title definitely deserves four stars and his first book deserves at least five stars lynch and rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time you 'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection

never before have i been moved so completely by a simple reference book the author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for ron hubbard 's dianetics not an easy task i bought this for my grandmother and she hates books that 's how good this is better than cats '' she says i ca n't say i necessarily agree with her for starters the private sector 's influence on public policy and is nowhere near as entertaining as mister mistofellees ' song and dance but who am i to argue with an old woman nobody that 's who

this fiction of a plot against american jews is very interesting it is well written and it holds your attention the little boy telling the story and the intricacy of politics attached to the story make this novel a book you can not put aside this is about an era of american history and it is well documented i recommend it to everyone the older generation who lived thru it and particularly to the younger generation of people who are not familiar with this period it teaches that history is constantly in the remake and cultural differences are still a problem in our world
lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach used by billy beane and the oakland athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of primarily on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers this approach generated a number of divisional championships for oakland in the weakest american league division but no pennants and world are omitted variables and misspecification problems in the sabermetrics statistics approach of bill james used by james 's system totally ignores the number of batter outs are not flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an are thus the worst type of omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1 to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over for a regular everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the second problem is that the james system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball category is that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts walks where the runner is able to steal second walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out times a year and hits but has a obp james 's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors

i am a longtime jance fan and was n't disappointed with dead wrong any complaints would be the overemphasis on joanna 's pregnancy with a concomitant on tension and suspense great ending though ! butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book but also comes across as overly especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child jenny too has little to add to the story but joanna shines as usual nice to see such a reliable ethical and strong female protagonist
do n't get me wrong this was a really good book and i am so close to giving it 5 stars it was just a little too short for me the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game you will fly through this book it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it even after that mild short coming i mentioned just my opnion i could be wrong
i liked this book because it was quick and easy to read but also had more information in the back each month there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the er call your doc or wait 24 hours to check there were great decision guides that presented both sides i like that i know a reputable hospital stands behind the book as well i have 6 pregnancy books but this one is my favorite
background i read isaac 's storm by erik larson around 1998. recently i had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review larson covered three killer hurricanes two killer blizzards and one flash flood galveston and related hurricanes my first impression was that anyone who had read this book about a major hurricane would never consider riding out such a storm larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters isaac cline was the weather service chief at galveston at this time this book gives much detail on the galveston storm this hit the island in september 1900 with very little warning indeed it was the arrogance of the weather service in general and issac cline their station chief for this area in particular that essentially preempted any warning cline was one of the 'new men ' a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms '' first the weather service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from cuba the weather service had men stationed in cuba who said the storm was nothing to worry about '' cuban 's own weather observers who had pioneered hurricane detection disagreed '' secondly the weather service insisted that any storm warning had to come from the washington office with absolutely no exceptions finally isaac had the conviction and public position that no hurricane could ever hit galveston as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as galveston with such a position cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters larson cited two older hurricanes in his book september 16 1875 the storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through indianola pushing the waters of the gulf and matagorda bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea '' this storm took 176 lives august 20 1886 this storm completed the destruction of indianola so many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely in 1891 in the wake of a tropical storm that galveston weathered handily '' cline was asked to appraise the city 's vulnerability to extreme weather isaac wrote the opinion held by some that galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion '' he made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of galveston island at that time was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level he made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of indianola about 150 miles southwest of galveston on matagorda bay cline had a model '' of gulf hurricanes namely that no hurricane could ever hit galveston as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as galveston his model '' of these storms was clearly fatally flawed or politically influenced and it resulted in to deaths larson suggests there was a scent of boosterism '' behind this article and that he was writing an article that galveston promoters would be happy to see could this have been a harbinger of things to come could cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors then the storm hit both the weather service and isaac cline looked very arrogant before the storm and also in defending their overall performance after the storm other extreme weather events larson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book hail and flash flood august 1885 a severe downpour near san angelo including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with an escarpment of water that isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high '' blizzard november 1888 this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off new england and caused the death of 450 blizzard january 1899 this blizzard swept much of the south icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the mississippi past new orleans '' this storm even hit galveston and piled snow on it 's beaches and drove water out of the bay into the gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom conclusion isaac 's storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes 105 to 125 years ago it also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events also of the same vintage all in all a most interesting and rewarding book one that i would recommend highly
terrier will not disappoint tamora pierce fans ! the narration is done through first person told as a journal this is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story and difficult to account for actions the narrator has n't seen but tamora has performed her usual magic snatching up the readers ' interest from the first page and holding it until the last i even read all of the notes pages and the bio readers may find it difficult to put down once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo
this is the third book i have read by grisham and so far i have really enjoyed each one grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller this book does not have any scenes which i really enjoy but it still kept my attention very well grisham gives you just enough inside details '' to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer for example at one point the clues seemed to point to fletcher coal being involved in the killings but that was way off the mark in the end this characteristic of grisham 's writings makes for a very enjoyable read one of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between gray and darby they had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted then it very quickly blossomed into an open show of affection even though at the same time darby was supposedly mourning for thomas even so that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all overall this is a very captivating book that really holds your attention i highly recommend it as well as grisham 's other books so far i have found grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers i promise that you will not be disappointed read and enjoy

this collection of stories and essays by david sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety overall i found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful some stories were a bit dry but others such as santaland diaries '' and diary of a smoker '' had me laughing out load however the best stories i found were the ones such season 's greetings to our friends and family ! ! ! '' which i had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor i would definitely like to read more of sedaris ' works especially those based on his experiences as overall i found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories
guys and dolls is a fantastic musical and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it unfortunately some songs like marry the man today my time of day follow the fold and the oldest established have been left out from the book but that is the price you pay or rather do n't pay when you do n't buy the full vocal score however this book will satisfy fans of the show complete with pictures from the original 1950 broadway production the 1955 film and the new 1992 broadway revival definately this book is a good buy

i '' is for i think you would like this book if you read it it was a little bit wordy at the beginnig but each page gets better than the one before you will be glad you got past the first few pages because it gets a lot more interesting as you go along and the ending of this book is really something else it makes the whole book well worth reading i really liked the book and i think you will too
you know that guy down the street who acts awful what about the cashier at walmart who is catty and there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys neil gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize in this novel gods which represent animals roam the earth in the bodies of humans the main character is the clever spider who interacts with other in everyday human life this book along with other science fiction books has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination the strong point of this novel is the humor employed by neil gaiman on par with douglas adams the author of anasi boys fills the pages with quirky laden humor the main character fat charlie i found much in common with his awkward moments with friends family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with the story however is n't anything special i like witches and as much as the next guy but the plot is uninteresting it is a rare book that combines wit with plot and this is not one of those rare books

the use of an integrated development environment ide for a user to learn a language in and to then program within is well known microsoft has made powerful ides for its languages and the open source eclipse can be used for java along these lines ducasse offers his book it teaches smalltalk using the squeak ide the twist is that squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory to convey the crucial concepts of as ducasse explains squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger so a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital given her limited background and possibly limited attention span squeak uses smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language if you come from java or c you may be struck by its simplicity compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn smalltalk or squeak itself i wonder a little about the book itself though a motivated high school student could easily use it but for some younger students in that situation it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher who can then instruct from it
a very straight forward book by jim otto there is a price when one wants to achieve or aspire to achieve glory on the gridiron jim otto is that person and he candidly tells us what he was willing to sacrifice to reach that plateau for the raider fan at heart or a football fan in general this is the book to read

in this fascinating collection of essays dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis over the last years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms subsidised housing free pay checks child support and free medical benefits from a liberal political standpoint this support for the nation 's have nots '' is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor one would logically assume that providing the poor with life 's essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society in fact as dalrymple proposes it has had an opposite effect crime in his native england has skyrocketed drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence why liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives it is always the rich the government or societies institutions that is to blame thus crime continues to rise while england 's welfare state has grown into an unwieldy goliath dalrymple has worked in numerous countries and has been an attending physician and psychiatric consultant in london 's prisons for many years thus his thesis is not born from some abstract social theory about human behaviour he has treated thousands of victims of domestic violence consulted thousands of prisoners who have been incarcerated for petty crime to murder the common thread that runs through all these cases is a pathological denial of responsibility for their own circumstances or conditions as dalrymple explains '' like so many modern ills the coarseness of spirit and behaviour grows out of ideas brewed up in the academy and among intellectuals ideas that have seeped outward and are now having their practical effect on society the relativism that has ruled the academy for many years has now come to rule the mind of the population '' in other words this post modern notion that there is no high and low art no good and bad no subtlety and crudeness only relative perspectives taking this further our behaviour too is not individually determined but society and its oppressive inequalities that make me who i am and a biological predisposition which causes me to steal from the old lady next door beat my wife beyond recognition and consume drugs and alcohol like there is no tomorrow the trickling down of these academic theories biological determinism marxism and the post modern theory that there are no levels of hierarchical values only difference has created an underclass of victims who believe they should get something for nothing and commit crime because society has created them as victims as does not exist dalrymple provides numerous real life examples from his practice working in a hospital in london his writing style is straight forward at times literary but never sentimental the arguments in these essays are persuasive and push the reader to examine the underlying modern ideologies that have created and sustain a well provided for underclass of criminal victims ''
this is a pretty good book however i would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of lincoln 's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective
a fraudulent marine biologist whose wife is about to expose his of phosphate pollution of the florida everglades tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him it 's a wonderfully comic although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the murderer become repetitious a few ends are left loose it challenged comparison with the florida novels of elmore leonard such as maximum bob '' and stick '' but it does not quite live up to the master some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky floridians with stolid upper midwesterners seemed to derive from david barry and euripides ovid and tasso used the gimmick i thought this was his best since striptease '' the intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and although i 'm a lover myself overloaded with environmentalist politics incidentally is n't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental
i really do n't understand all the negative reviews about this book i found it an easy to read pleasant mystery with a main character in midlife turmoil i wanted to sympathize with jance did an excellent job keeping the pace reasonably fast while not losing the reader with extraneous characters

this thing sat on my shelf for the longest time only the notice of the upcoming release this november of pynchon 's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again it 's not that it is n't brilliant no one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder the first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you 'll ever read and it 's not like this is the only pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into there are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at v or gravity 's rainbow before catching the wave but mason and dixon is a lot of work if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the century prose style can you imagine the effort it took to produce it john barth 's sotweed factor is similar and yet somehow infinitely more accessible and highly recommended ! pynchon 's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness especially in a work this voluminous and yet the darn thing is consistently challenging if one has the patience and energy to put into it it seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book and the emotional satisfaction one gain 's when reaching towards the conclusion one thing for sure for once pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels this time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players this book is a great as you want it to be if you 're willing to work at it i 'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble meanwhile i 've got a couple months to see if i can make more of a dent into the recognitions
this is a great book i will not go into so much detail as the previous reviewers but i must give credit where it is due having read many books on the subject of the bush white house including fiasco '' and state of denial '' i did not think i would learn much more from this one i bought the book a few days ago mainly because i like david corn when i read it i was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is i think along with the two books i mentioned earlier this trio make up the essential reading on bush iraq and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories if you could only read one i would call it a dead heat between hubris '' and state of denial '' if pressed i suppose i would have to give the edge to hubris as the writing was much less tedious i thought
this was fantastic it took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the kentucky derby and never let up vincente callabrese is a part time for the mob and part time movie producer student when vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for vincente first a name change from vincente callabrese to michael vincent then it 's off to hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business unfortunately michael has a hard time shaking his past when he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused he asks his old friend tommy povenzano for help tommy assures michael the he will help this is the start of all of michael 's problems in typical woods fashion this novel is a mover though this novel is n't full of excitement it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next it does n't take long between incidents the bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed choke dead in the water orchid beach these are all other options by stuart and i would recommend any of them though this book has not won any awards woods won the edgar alan poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why

this bible blew me away when i went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life i was so impressed i bought one for myself this bible is many things but the first thing that i noticed quite honestly is that the colors were bright the print readable and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical bible without growing to an unwieldy size the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information written in a modern friendly style that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the good book both understandable and relevant to today 's society that is what makes it perfect for someone like my young friend who is unfamiliar with religion christianity or just plain old bible study it 's less intimidating that most bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you do n't feel unprepared '' if you pick it up cold catholics are often les familiar with the bible than many protestant denominations as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile however a better relationship and understanding of the word can only enhance one 's spiritual life and experience as a catholic if that applies to you which i have to admit it did to me this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in biblical translation discussion interpretation and modern relevance who wo n't like this bible 1 those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the king james version 2 those already familiar with intensive bible study if not working with youth or those less familiar 3 most protestants the discussion is from a very clear catholic viewpoint not really controversial just catholic 4 and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the bible accessible '' and relevant '' through use of the and point of view of today 's set i believe one reviewer felt that the bible did n't need to be made culturally relevant finding the sidebars on race cultural differences modern morality and varying interpretations to be just another extension of the political correctness '' movement i could n't disagree more the bible should be the one book that everyone can see themselves '' in should they seek such a thing this bible does that for a new generation of catholics and for a new hesitant group of explorers i 'd ballpark the appropriate age for this version at around years
i handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they could n't order any more reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in europe that he carries you along i especially love the story of little portugal which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one the us could learn from that example and from many other european examples in this book when you read the story about ge and honeywell you 'll realize we 're going to have to because they 're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not

currently educational studies are being revealed which are showing that students of minority heritage particularly black and latino have an affinity towards interpersonal learning and tactile learning interpersonal learning through being social and group work tactile learning by building or constructing things our current educational institutions especially high school and below cater to auditory hearing and intrapersonal introverted little group work learners so in total poverty and language barriers are likely not the biggest culprit towards our low school scores in areas of economic problems rather it is the fact that teachers are not teaching to the strengths of our children as a matter of fact most children are being taught within the areas of their learning weaknesses with that in mind frames of mind is one of the first books to distiguish the way we learn and how to cater to it within this book lies the best solutions to our educational system and its only a matter of getting the teachers to facilitate their lesson plans differently i highly recommend this book especially to those who are interested in seeing what the future of america is all abou
i have purchased probably 5 business plan books and software packages over the last 8 years none of them were clear enough or easy enough to get me through the process of writing a good complete business plan this one really works i sat down with the book and software and over the course of a week wrote a business plan that has received great results every business owner needs a business plan and this is somethig that you really do have to do for yourself unfortunately writing a good business plan does not come easily to many people this book will get you through the process and you will end up with a good plan my only complaint is that the software is windows only

in his book trading risk ken grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for tudor investments and sac capital to create an insightful and surprisingly guide for traders and portfolio managers as director of trader development at a large proprietary trading house i have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders moreover this is a scalable difference risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades results of trading days and performance across entire quarters where i believe grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply cutting your losses '' trading risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results his discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of that is rarely practiced perhaps an example from my own work with traders that overlaps grant 's ideas might be illustrative i encourage traders to keep a log of all their trades that tracks time of day position taken position size holding period and changes to the position are also documented as traders scale into or out of trades from this record we can evaluate a host of performance statistics such as position sizing as a function of market the correlation of profitability with trade period and patterns of activity within the trading day while grant 's background is with portfolio to a manager who is holding a basket of positions in a variety of ideas are easily adaptable to the intraday trader who is trading a single instrument by viewing each trade during a day as an element of that day 's portfolio '' we can ask important questions about the mix of position sizes overall directional bias and the management of volatility as a function of trade limits written in an engaging style with bits of humor interspersed trading risk ends with a practical chapter that summarizes the book 's major points he explains the importance of developing and modifying trading plans defining one 's trading edge '' judiciously allocating risk capital and improving performance at the margin '' this latter point is a particularly neglected element in risk management for the active large trader the ability to squeeze the extra tick out of trades is frequently the difference between a winning day and a losing one superior traders have an ability to read the very patterns of price change and momentum to determine when it is prudent to hit the bid or let the market go offer in exiting a position at such points good risk management and good trading are indistinguishable i have few reservations about grant 's book a text of 250 pages is not going to provide many examples something that would help the more mathematically challenged master the ideas of and correlation analysis small retail traders who trade only occasionally will probably find the risk metrics less compelling than larger active traders or portfolio managers though the basic principles emphasized in the last chapter certainly apply to any serious trader considering the absence of serious discussions of risk management in the popular trading literature trading risk is a major contribution and a worthy addition to a library i plan to use it as a core reading in our training program for new traders perhaps the best endorsement i can give
once again i am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject i bought this to get a better feel for the old testament operative word is feel '' as a roman catholic the old testament is addressed in the first reading at mass but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner it is particularly confusing hard to read and difficult to understand in proper context without some help in fact there are portions of the old testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous davis 's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people in a certain time and place and within a historical milieu it may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like but it is sufficient to be effective it is just too simplistic to look to the bible for all answers as if it were some sort of statutory code with the answers to all questions the search and answers for truth are never ending and the bible is a beginning i get more from catholic writers who explore the bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world than i do from the book itself davis is throwing in his spin as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the bible in historical context which i found quite helpful take it for what is worth a spin in a convertible through the bible a nice ride but nothing more
i was fortunate enough to have seen the vermeer exhibition at the national gallery of art in washington during the winter of 21 out of the 35 or 36 extant paintings by vermeer were included in the show offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of vermeer 's amazing works in a single space something that no one has experienced since 1696 when 20 of his paintings were auctioned in delft given the rarity and fragility of vermeer 's works it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated all who were unable to make it to the show however have this splendid book as a document of this unique event this book will remain the standard work on vermeer for many decades and represents the fruit of several years ' labor by art historians on two continents because so little is in fact known about vermeer the man in truth we have no idea at all what vermeer 's education interests and personality were like the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing vermeer 's work within the history of dutch painting the development of perspective and the fascinating tale of vermeer 's rediscovery '' in the century and his rise to worldwide fame the essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct vermeer 's exact technique something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves no drawings by vermeer have survived nor have any statements he may have made about painting this extensive scholarly apparatus while illuminating and occasionally even riveting the essay dealing with vermeer 's rediscovery is a great detective narrative ! tends to obscure the strange even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with vermeer 's personal world so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano the music lesson vibrate with dramatic tension sadly the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures all of which are superbly reproduced in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue what is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry novels and countless studies i was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images but the traditional overly scholarly and dry art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the sphinx of delft '' that said the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist barring some new discovery it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about vermeer and his world than can be read here exquisitely designed and distinguished with beautiful reproductions the volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book when i attended the show the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback johannes vermeer is the text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon immerse yourself in vermeer 's world and you will be transformed seeing this exhibition changed my life and i treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time i hope you will enjoy this book as much as i have
in the new work of dogs '' author jon katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs topic he has detailed in previous books examining the relationship on a broader scale informed by arduous research a two foot stack of papers books journals he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs are doing different work from their traditional herding hunting and guarding we have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions therapy dogs even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world the notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of the greatest generation '' is new at least to me katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of montclair new jersey more often than not he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people many of these dogs are pampered untrained and confused others are abused to some extent whether through deliberate actions or through negligence the stories are alarming and informing i see many of the mistakes i made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two australian shepherds are as as they seem many reviewers have commented and correctly that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book sadly i think katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs who train their dogs who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules and who treat their dogs with consistent loving authority katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die the numbers are staggering and he takes matters a step further with the idea that if we have dog rescue groups how can we not also have their counterparts to reach out to those of our own species in dire need

i found this book on my own before going to get my mba and was always a bit embarrased to admit that i had learned more from this book than any other it 's design makes it look a bit elementary i was pleasantly surprised to see that my finance professor at the mba program babson the 1 entrepreneurship program 11 years running brought it out on the first day and said it was a must '' for any businessperson 's library ! it is a fantastic resource do n't let the look fool you

while this book had some minor flaws i 'll discuss those briefly later it is worth owning especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of cirque du soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances there is another book out there that explores one man 's experiences with one performer and it is also intriquing but this new book reveals more about a wider variety of artists directors designers etc and for all those who 've watched and been entranced by a cirque du soleil performance would n't we all like to create a little of that magic in our lives would n't we all like to ignite our own creative fires even if they come out in different ways perhaps in writing perhaps in our work lives or the time we spend with our families or while alone one of the main lessons i got from this book is that being fully open as possible to one 's imagination hopes dreams and aspirations can lead in wondrous directions and affect even the most practical '' or mundane tasks of life it just takes the willingness to take the risk to accept failure and setbacks in return for spiritual and emotional growth and lifechanging experiences this is more than a book geared to artists and peformers it truly is for the rest of us it can change your life having said that i found myself wanting more felt myself not quite fully satisfied by this book i felt some of the sections were a little too pat or formulaic but these are minor quibbles when the book offers so much and is one of the few books that really explores the cirque du soleil creative process until a better one comes along i 'd consider this a must for anyone wanting to know more about the secrets and techniques of the cirque du soleil spark '' a spark that can affect us all
yes it 's cliche yes the plot is lifted directly from star wars yes there are obvious references to anne mccaffrey tolkien and other fantasy writers but who cares eragon is above all else an enjoyable read despite underlying flaws in the writing paolini effectively tells a rewarding story in a world with a magic system and a realism tolkien could never muster sure eragon has its critics mostly aspiring writers that have not enjoyed paolini 's success but if you can ignore their blustering and simply take the book at face value i think you 'll be pleasantly surprised although not as epic or impressive as some of the older fantasy works eragon is nonetheless a great read
i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters '' the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience especially in nyc 's best '' restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective as objective as food tastes get i suppose review a very easy and enjoyable read

this book provides the reader with a clear basic understandingof the grounding of popular opinion regarding gay life during the years while the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are i only hope that it will inspire others whose experience of being gay is a relatively new one to realize how important political activism and community still is not only that a very engaging read
loved it highly suggest it could n't put it down
with over 1000 recipes this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it 's paces but i 've had great results with the few dishes i 've tried so far the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked with a gem of a condiment included pickled red onion i 'd use that on any sandwich anytime the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette really a sambal vinaigrette and wasabi cream were awesome veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners granted i have n't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook but so far so good ! i picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it about a penny a recipe ! what a deal

what a wonderful book this author has written it talks about developing interpersonal skills public speaking skills prospecting skills networking etiquette sales skills marketing principles and even customer service it mentions the power of the thank you note and of giving more than you receive it also devotes a chapter on some things about businesses and a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity i 'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included quite frankly i think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here and i think chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book and not included in this book either but who cares ! anybody interested in the main thrust of the book endless referrals is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 and they are well written and informative what i liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter i did not have to wade through the book the first time through i just had to read the summaries the other thing that was really nice about the book was the recommended reading '' sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book those booklists were very thorough and helpful 5 stars
'conservatives without conscience ' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science there is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science but john dean does a good job of explaining the basics and how it applies to our modern political landscape this is not new information it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the carl rove wing of the republican party the academics keep measuring and refining their understanding and carl rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public finally someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see knowledge is power so everyone should read his book however one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits they do n't tend to read books much anyway it is a book for the open minded that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape the by any means necessary tactics of many named players and the movement that has hijacked our country john dean pulls no punches he names names and kicks butt he gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism but even that is well worth the effort if you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the republican party and those who unquestionably support them then read this book it is an eye opener

while the brooklyn bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the east river it 's one of the strongest sturdiest and will most likely outlast the manhattan and williamsburg bridges john roebling and his son washington did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure but the roeblings ' gaps in knowledge also worked against them one of the most interesting portions of the book is where mccullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the east river where washington roebling and many his workers spent their time few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body the quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many including washington with a condition known as the bends washington 's wife emily was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while washington struggled with the bends there are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction mccullough 's book is much more about the politics and people behind brooklyn bridge rather than the engineering i would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques but i still found this book reasonably engaging
this book gives insight to how the mind with a purpose of being a millionare looks at everything he does an easy read and highly recommended
i have bought many books in my life but randy gage 's why you 're dumb sick and broke '' is the first time i ever bought a book with a parental advisory warning for explicit language gage does things a little differently than anyone else which is something i quickly discovered when reading this book this book is brash to the point and filled with insight and inspiration i thought that gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on many points presented in the book are in other personal development books however i do n't know of any book that has all these points in one book even gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of think and grow rich the secret ayn rand and several other books and cd 's a lot of it you have heard before like if you say you are broke then you will always be broke however i did n't realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative broke thoughts most frightening of all i learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power i am taking randy 's lead and watching less tv especially the news that 's the worst of all ! there is also a nice introduction to libertarianism and the works of ayn rand as a libertarian myself i was delighted to see this included in the book with recent reports circulating about britain on the verge of becoming a police state this warning about big government could n't have come at a more appropriate time as expected randy does make a plug for mlm but this is by no means an mlm book the mlm plug is just a few short pages however it is still a nice resource for mlm people to use for third party credibility he also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well i must be smart healthy and rich as i am already involved in all three i found myself nodding in agreement to this book i also found a lot of places where i was thinking oh i 'm not the only one who this this way why has n't this been mentioned before in the press '' other times i thought oh my god i am being really manipulated here '' while he was preaching to the choir '' with me i 'm sure that many people with more mainstream '' views will feel more challenged reading this book bottom line if you love mlm get 10 copies of this book if you support the libertarians get 10 copies of this book if you are like me and love them both get 25 copies about the author carlos scarpero is the host of the network marketing minute podcast and the creator of the success duplicator downline building system

the authors map out clear effective and proven strategies for rewarding parenting in this excellent guide an imaginative approach was called for when my 16 year old boy jonathan threatened to barricade himself in his bedroom using just twigs leaves and his own spittle and dung and this guide provided just that there 's nothing wrong with setting parameters the authors say just as long as that are not arbitrary or capricious and they are clearly articulated and for crying out loud why should he be allowed to act like a nesting african hornbill under my roof
tony hillerman once again takes us into the world of the navajo with jim chee and the legendary joe leaphorn of the navajo tribal police i read this for the first time some years ago and this entry in the series is very exciting it has a lot of atmosphere and leaphorn and chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read both chee and leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins chee has n't quite figured out how he feels about mary leaving him because he could not leave his navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her he is smitten with a pretty navajo attorney named janet but she 's with someone else leaphorn meanwhile is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife emma niether he or chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named eleanor no navajo would be involved as stealing pots like this would make one a thief of time '' according to navajo tradition chee 's letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to leaphorn 's investigation and once more chee will be helping leaphorn all across the navajo territory this one will stretch all the way into utah and down the san juan river leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy 's death by drowning before this one wraps up and it will have unexpected ties to his search for eleanor it seems eleanor was looking for pots made by the anasazi a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth pictographs and petroglyphs of kokopelli the watersprinkler '' will play a vital part in this mystery but eleanor 's interest is also anthropological and someone thinks what she 's discovered is worth killing for leaphorn and chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery one will have to race to the other as things turn ugly and two very different men will find commom ground when leaphorn asks the unexpected of young chee hillerman 's descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the san juan river at night under a sky filled with navajo mystery will enthrall you this is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series you do n't want to miss this one

the position enjoyed by mohammed as a prophet of god is disputed by his unprovoked attacks on innocent people islam was spread by use of the sword because americans are poorly educated on religious history in general and middle eastern history in particular this book is a must read it is a single source for how islam became as powerful as it is today the editor uses multiple sources to document the facts necessary to allow the reader to support the assertion that islam is a violent religion
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it i read it as a novel for entertainment years later i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading i was able to examine the russian names characters events and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going which it certainly is but in it tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space with one atom colliding at random with another but when a sufficient number act in concert such as napoleon 's invasion of russia their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms then they are drawing closer to a universal one '' with nature this one '' tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one '' or any other deity but he does say that history time and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going
marvelous story with historical concepts and involment leading the reader to intrigue and fascination buy this book
w is not really number one ritter 's book is best summed up by ritter in these 4 paragraphs from the epilogue '' the notion of the war in iraq resulting from an intelligence failure is very convenient for all parties involved the intelligence community can simply say that intelligence is a tricky business and sometimes you get it wrong this of course provides a convenient excuse for the politicians and compliant media to contend that they were simply acting in the public interest based upon the information they were given in the end to accept the concept of iraq as an intelligence failure one must first accept the premise that the usa was implementing as its primary objective for iraq the security council 's resolutions on disarmament this argument is simpy not sustainable the behavior of the united states government and its intelligence agencies during my time as an inspector was not that of a government that was serious about disarmament support for unscom 's mission was at best tailored to the political imperatives at any given time there was a total willingness to compromise the integrity of unscom and with it the whole notion of multilateral disarmament for tactical advantages in the battle between the us and iraqi regimes towards the end of the inspections era elements of the us government actively sought to make unscom 's job more difficult by cutting it off from intelligence sources disarmament was simply not the usa 's principal policy objective in iraq after 1991. regime change was the cia was designated as the principal implementer of this policy therefore when one looks at the march 2003 invasion of iraq and the subsequent removal of power of the government of saddam hussein the only conclusion that can be reached is that the cia accomplished its mission iraq was in fact a great intelligence victory insofar as the cia through its manipulation of the work of the un weapons inspectors and the distortion of fact about iraq 's wmd programs maintained the public perception of an armed and defiant iraq in the face of plausible and plentiful evidence to the contrary we now know that both the us and uk intelligence services had by july 2002 agreed to 'fix the intelligence around policy ' but the fact remains that at least as far as the cia is concerned the issue of 'fixing intelligence around policy ' predates july 2002 reaching as far back as 1992 when the decision was made to doctor the intelligence about iraqi scud missile accounting asserting the existence of missiles in the face of unscom inspection results which demonstrated that there were none as an american i find it very disturbing that the intelligence services of my country would resort to lies and deceit when addressing an issue of such fundamental importance to the security of the usa intelligence to me has always been about the facts when intelligence is skewed to fit policy then the entire system of trust that is fundamental in a free and democratic society is put at risk iraq and the role of the cia in selling the war with iraq is a manifestation of such a breach of trust '' we 've been had on the grand scale the problem of politicization of intelligence '' is clearly a issue i 'm recommending this book for anyone who seeks the truth about iraq 's wmd 's i 'm giving this book stars just for delivering up the truth damn the consequences
it 's been awhile since i had a really good crime mystery read therefore i was excited when the cold moon by jeffery deaver arrived at the library the latest lincoln rhyme novel delivered just what i was looking for twists turns and plenty of forensic work the plotline here starts out on two tracks a killer nicknamed the watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques his signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene rhyme and amelia sachs his partner are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder the murder points to a bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis there 's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt so sachs has to step carefully as it 's not clear who she can trust the two cases converge when the watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that sachs is investigating but the layering of deception goes even deeper than that and rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind the watchmaker if you want plot twists and turns this book will definitely satisfy there are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion only to be something else entirely the layering of plots by the killer never seems to end and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction a couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top but not so much as to put me off the story it 's a book i really did n't want to put down even though i had other things i should be
this was the first book by johnson i read though my mentors and teachers spoke of him often the information about the mandorla was particularly helpful giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility johnson writes that if i can be with the opposites at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both produce something utterly new instead of win lose or compromise the key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation i face formulas 's devices and processes can never be enough in such moments referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to another 's experience or advice ca n't do it either because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter i liked what maria had to say in her post meet your shadow '' dated november 22 2003. she said she gave it only 4 stars because he does n't tell how to do that is described as possible in the book i felt a little of that too and i have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until i 've done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations a book i found to be a perfect companion to this one is i of the storm embracing conflict creating peace '' by gary simmons i highly recommend it in addition to this book it addresses some of the questions i felt about the nature of conflict after finishing owning your own shadow in a way that shed light into my life i am very appreciative of both books
liz perle does a really nice job in money a memoir '' of weaving statistics professional studies and other people 's experiences with her own personal experience and insight while many parts of her book sound familiar women shopping when they 're in a slump it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard the other thing i appreciated about the book was that perle does n't claim to have all the answers and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money which to me sounded like something i could attempt and achieve thanks liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read

michael haller 's life revolves around criminal defense his an attorney operating out the back of his lincoln town car his appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy people either called him mick or mickey tall dark and intelligent with his good looks and irish blood lines made him a catch in the court room he was very together with great timing in his personal life it was a mess at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter his father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to his father wrote books and practised law that did n't have room for innocent clients so far mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just would n't recognize innocence if it came along being an independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who could n't afford to pay his fees in total he kept four lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour what he was really looking for was a franchise player a case to keep the cash rolling point blank a meal ticket louis ross roulet dealt in la property he was a rich playboy currently booked on charges of gbi and attempted rape and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court mickey could n't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook this was all too easy in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case just as he was on a roll mickey 's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just did n't sit right in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil this is the first time in a long time that i have picked up a book based on a court room drama but this book is much more than just that michael connelly has done a wonderful job his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through well written and easy to follow so you do n't get lost in the jargon of law especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the us law system i 'm hoping very much that connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer mickey haller in other books going forward congratulations to michael connelly for a rollercoaster read
this is the best book available on the great storm of 1900 and its effect on galveston texas an unbelievable amount of research obviously went into it very well written highly recommended
mcneill calls american indians and africans little more than the victims of the west in this book he explains that they have little role in the development of culture which he sees as passing from society to society from mesopotamia on like some sort of conceptual olympic torch and some get it and others do not it is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history and difficult to read without cringing that said the book contains marvelous elements few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements one to another over the expanse of time few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as mcneil so with all its faults it is very worthy book certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings
red lily is clearly the best book in the series while reading this one i could visualize the scenes this book would make a good movie but i ca n't decide under what category it would fit into although it 's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller with all the talk of a ghost as the rest of the series this book it is n't a believable read as much as a fun read
for those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through the writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of china and its muscle power instead of branding china as a villain we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains china would n't be where it is now is covered in detail the writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing it 's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when china has perfected its manufacturing bases just as japan and south korea had done before it then there 's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located and how china is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour china 's progress is n't simply detrimental to other countries on contrary it benefits them as well for example australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to china with increase of living standard in china chinese needs more nutritious food as china could n't provide enough united states particularly the middle states are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the middle kingdom then there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping united states in check by siding with china and also the love and hate relationship between usa and china of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in china and so forth whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided since china has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks yes some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately i think they are missing the points what 's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about china and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come highly recommended
everyone should follow the advise published on the outside cover of this book '' you live in this world you use oil you must read this book

i just finished the book last night crying as i read the last few pages i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press she was a delightful and woman filled with life which makes her ending even more tragic the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde

reviewed by bette daoust for reader views i find it interesting that i am reviewing a book i had read five years ago when it first came out all this really means is that this book has definite longevity and believe it or not all of the predictions '' in the book are a reality today seth godin set forth to spread his book like a virus to everyone he could through his connections and their connections and their connections and so on and so on '' the truth is the idea virus is real and his book is living proof that ideas and other products can certainly be spread by mouth email infrared download or whatever i have always been an admirer of seth godin and although i have not read all of his books i will make certain that i do he has a keen sense of marketing like no other as in his purple cow '' as well as this book unleashing the idea virus '' who better to write about spreading ideas around than seth his book has certainly hit the circuit and still has a long way to go before absolutely everyone who should read this book and apply the information this book is a must for anyone that touches the marketing function in their business the idea virus is a book full of common sense items but with a twist that makes them more realistic than just theory the real life situations described bring all the points to home i just hope that the next time i sneeze a new idea the targeted hive picks it up and swarms around it and passes it on i want to own the market in my defined hive and i want it to propagate and live on for a long time this book is one terrific example ! go download it or purchase it at the bookstore
every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator the century of rome was such a time and tacitus was such a communicator the histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history the historian will do well to read tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity while observing and commenting on the human element in history tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil wars and rumors of wars his beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity his example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow a word on this translation in particular i found wellesley 's translation very readable and poetic he seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content well done
philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references he gives the reader a wonderful sense of the social religious and political forces that motivated the pilgrims in their incredibly risky venture into the unknown the book presents a fascinating view of the clash of the native american and english cultures that tragically led to the near annihilation of the new england indians ''
i enjoyed reading the mark it was definitely a page turner of course it makes me want to continue with the series tim lahaye is a great author and story teller i actually visualized the whole the thing i would thank him in person if i could for a wonderful job done thank
first the strengths andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists with chapters on munsterberg arnheim eisenstein balazs kracauer bazin mitry metz and ayfre and agel he focuses on the debate between the formalists who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing framing lighting and etc and the realist tradition who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography a physical impression of its subject the highlight is undoubtedly andrew 's excellent discussion of the great french critic andre bazin which is not surprising since andrew 's thesis was on bazin the weaknesses this was published in 1976 and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then especially feminism and the influence of lacan and psychoanalytic theory still this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory

tony sweet 's photographs are breathtaking ! as you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work i am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work i think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book
definitely one of the best books i have read the curious incident of the dog in the by mark haddon is a complex mixture of simple things the simplicity of the language style ideas characters and concepts is unique to this book the expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite in the book mark haddon borrows the voice of his lead character christopher an autistic child to tell the story christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy he 's a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems his approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues the story mainly revolves around christopher 's investigation to find out who killed his neighbour 's dog wellington despite his father 's instructions to not pursue the issue christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed wellington the story unravels before christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life his investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who he knows died three years earlier christopher 's determination to solve the mystery of who killed wellington and the mystery of his mother 's death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story the child 's emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page the reader experiences christopher 's feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story the story in itself is funny at times sad and miserable at others complex in one place and extremely simple in another this is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through your world will never be the same again in a good way
this is one of the best and scariest business books i 've ever read christensen clearly illustrates why many of the 'tried and true ' formulas really do n't work his research is compelling and is presented clearly enough for readers i ca n't recommend this book highly enough
being a mcguane fan i think he just keeps getting better not only is he the best fishing writer alive but his stories are bizzarely entertaining have an interesting twist and always explore human interaction i believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences from crazy street people to ceos as well as the many places he has lived who else would know what a cabinet is except a rhode island resident what no mention of hot weiners or coffee milk
i was anxious to try the artisanal gougere recipe and i was not disappointed ! the cheese puffs were light and cheesey and beautiful to look at ! i compared his recipe to le cordon blue recipe and his adds a pinch of baking powder and about times the amount of cheese plus he give approximate mixing times which was a blessing for me since i had never made cream puff dough before the cordon blue version had no mixing times and with such a small amount of cheese compared to the artisanal version i can not believe that it would be anywhere near as good this book appears to have terence 's personal touch not just regurgitation of classic bistro recipes

you want to read a horror story this is it this is the shameful way our government dealt with aids in the first six years it appeared in the by doing nothing at all everyone ignored it the cdc the nih the national cancer institute it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors and they were ignored too over 2000 gay men and hemophiliacs and straight people and babies died before the government even acknowleged that yes something new was going around newspapers and media did not report this because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a gay disease '' gay men did n't want to discuss that it might '' be spread through sex and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of liberation was unthinkable blood banks would n't even acknowlege the fact that their products were contaminated even after it was proven that transfusion aids was possible and happening by the time president reagan first uttered the word aids over americans were dead from the disease this book made me cry the entire way through it i wanted to scream i wanted to throw things i wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too a university official that was denying aids researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark well at least aids is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people '' how absolutely disgusting this is a dauntingly large 621 pages of reading all of it frustrating angering and yet still inspiring they did n't give up no one threw in the towel until their last breath or until funding sufficient funding was finally granted sadly the author himself died of aids in 1994. god bless everyone who worked so hard to make aids a household word which finally happened oh about seven stinking years after it first started killing people in the us what the heck is wrong with this country why did people have their heads in the sand for so long what 's so stinking wrong with us another book everyone should read if only to know how our government helped spread aids around the world by ignoring it for six damn years how many people did they kill by doing that far far too many we were the last civilized nation to institute an aids program this book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more and i did n't think that was possible god bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with aids
having been born in 1981 i was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of hiv and aids but this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic while lengthy it is extremely informative and if read with an open mind refreashingly unbiased i found myself taking extra time and care in reading and the band played on '' just to let the information sink in
been two years since the recovery of the amulet of samarkand and nathaniel now known as john mandrake is a government official in the office of internal affairs apprenticed to jessica whitwell his job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the resistance who have been causing a series of disturbances in london aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians he suspects the involvement of a girl named kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure and although correct in this assumption it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes when things start spiraling out of control he is forced to call upon bartimaeus again for help and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery political maneuvers foreign travel and ancient magic though certainly not as good as the first and a little too long the eye makes for good reading but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of favorite djinn that were the high point of book one amanda richards may 20 2006

i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters '' the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience especially in nyc 's best '' restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective as objective as food tastes get i suppose review a very easy and enjoyable read

we see a phrase a lot when we visit sites for writers world building by this we mean the setting the characters and everything else where our story will occur for me this often means maps memories and visits since i write about where i live but if you 'd like to see exactly what world building '' means head down to your local library and grab salem 's lot by stephen king yeah that 's right i 'm reviewing a book by stephen king as if his career really needs my help i bought my copy at foreign language bookstore on yanan lu in hangzhou with a new introduction that is a pleasure to read but i mentioned the library to save you some money when stephen king mania first gripped the world i missed it i saw the film of carrie and hated it years later at a guard desk on a long shift scheduled so suddenly that i had n't had a chance to visit the library i read what was in the desk instead thinner if i were stephen king i 'd have put a pen name on that crap as well one of king 's fans brought me around she recommended the shining of course i thought of that travesty no no she said read the book it 's much different yes it is it 's fantastic for its perceptiveness next up pet sematary which scared the crap out of me and that my friends is not easy on writing i 've gushed about that enough times the films stand by me and the apt pupil so in the end i appreciate king and forgive him for carrie and i think he 's forgiven himself we wo n't talk about the richard bachman alias although the film of the running man was fun in a stupid sort of way salem 's lot king 's second book and perhaps it should have been his first i 've been in china since 1999. if i ever want to visit a town in the us i do n't need a plane ticket i can just real salem 's lot consider it a clinic on world building these are the places and the people i left behind right there recorded by a master well except for the vampire i do n't recall seeing him in watha maybe he moved into my old house actually that 's stephen king right there he creates an entirely real world then throws in something unusual because it makes the story move and because he just thinks it 's cool a vampire here a rabid dog there a mind reader over there a ufo crashing into hickville nobody has defended stephen king by mentioning that william shakespeare trucked heavily with ghosts and witches and prophesies in his stories so i 'll limit myself to a single sentence i believe that just as i studied mary shelley 's frankenstein in a literature class one day students will study stephen king just nothing about cars that come to life because those stories really suck i will accuse stephen king of being uneven and he explains why in on writing but at his best i recommend him highly oh and here 's a weird bit of trivia i recognized the scene on page 50. nothing before it nothing after it just that one bit so i at least began reading this book probably at a guard desk tampa florida has excellent libraries at my guard desk when i was n't writing i was getting drunk on literature and i ca n't possibly remember it all but i think salem 's lot by stephen king plus the thanatos syndrome by walker percy spurred me to write the demons within which i later threw out but which gave descent into madness its back story for madman trivia buffs terrence and sandra howell once had their own novel it really sucked terrence had his own novel 15 years before that it also sucked he 's a composite of two classmates terrence cram and ricky howell so i 'm glad he finally showed up in some form in on writing stephen king tells us that he was so drunk and stoned at one point that he ca n't remember writing some of his books it seems i was so high on literature at one point that i forgot entire books i read including salem 's lot so i guess that getting old does have its advantages
simply awesome ! i keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in
were someone to write a biography of carl hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she would n't focus on the author 's latest triumph skinny dip it is one of his seminal achievements the book simply shines with humor well drawn characters action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts it is also one of his smoothest rides one gets the feeling that hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote here is an overview that will stimulate readers ' interest hiassin 's the book opens with chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship but by some twists and turns and luck joey survives long enough to be rescued much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as joey and her team pursue vengeance by the midpoint of the novel chaz is already an emotional wreck and it does n't look like joey is about to let up any time soon the moral backbone of the novel is twofold one is the pitting of the everglades forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants the everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business hiassin 's two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book but also lends it a feeling of seriousness and two is the pitting of criminals against victims who are n't going to take it anymore hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to joey as most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one 's helplessness there are six main characters in the book joey and her horny husband chaz joey 's rescuer mick who is a kind and eccentric who lives alone on an island joey 's brother a rich expatriate who raises sheep in new zealand hammernut the owner of a large agricultural empire and tool the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation the small group of is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp a hairdresser a senior and a cowardly lawyer though similar elements live in many of hiassin 's works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily this ca n't be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to hiassin 's love for storytelling his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions in this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle except for tool character changes throughout the book joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of hiassin 's previous works mick hiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism but the issue is slightly complicated by skinny dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes while the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her 13 million trust but her brother spends lavishly joey 's rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check one may wonder if the only difference between chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation be it for sex money or escape uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals on the other hand joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals like most of hiassin 's work this book is not an overly violent one although it begins with an attempted murder the event is quite peaceful there is no struggle no blood and the victim joey does not die after reading skinny dip i immediately lent it to my best friend katie who has not been able to put it down so potential readers be warned like katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two but the time is not wasted on hiassin 's best work to date one comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place in short carl hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves
i bought this reluctantly because it was decided upon by a discussion group i was partipating in but i ended up being very glad to have read this wonderful piece of contemporary literature mary lawson weaves an incredibly sad but totally compelling tale of life in a small community in canada others here have given insight into the plot and characters so i 'll keep this short by saying that you wo n't be disappointed and that i eagerly look forward to reading more from this author she seems to have exceptional talent
as one of america 's greatest presidents ronald reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and like abraham lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations this book and his earlier autobiography where 's the rest of me will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions this work an american life however will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor for anyone who had the pleasure of listening to reagan 's political commentaries on the radio or hearing him speak as governor of california or as president of the united states the book will be particularly enjoyable for it is written in the conversational style that reagan used in life what makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which ronald reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today you may also observe that the problems of reagan 's day are not much different than those we face today i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand ronald reagan how his many faceted character was formed the inner workings of his mind and the actions which led to his monumental achievements in my view it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every american child
jeff shaara never ceases to amaze i have absolutely loved everyone of his and his fathers books i have been waiting awhile for him to delve into world war 2. and he did not disappoint me first things first i could not put this book down everything about it was phenomenal icant explain it in any other way please read this book even if you dont like books like this it is well worth your time
i love historical fiction and the march was one of the better historical novels that i 've read the characters are and the action moves along briskly with no dead spots the civil war background seemed very authentic and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions the march blends the two to show that war really is hell doctorow is an excellent writer and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable my only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue that 's not true as studies of union soldiers ' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members or for other reasons than just slavery that also applies to confederate soldiers a minor quibble that does n't really hurt the book but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real documented historical fact highly recommended

the pelican brief is one of john grisham 's more fast paced and exciting book two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on darby shaw and her are intrigued by who could have done this so darby does a ton of research and writes the pelican brief '' her is a good friend of someone in the fbi and the file gets distributed the bad guys find out about darby who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins this book is very entertaining with nonstop action you 'll be constantly turning the page to see how darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold the only problems with the book are as follows 1 the book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times 2 the book is all action and adventure and little else once it 's done you 'll never go back and read it again this would make a very poor book club book 3 a little over the top on the implied sex etc between darby and her professor etc but nothing compared to what you 'll get in other books overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of soul '' i would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books
i listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away it is a find ! nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places like news readers i loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book i also liked that the story was partly done in first person the main character initially does n't seem to have much to offer the world anyway there are others who have diagramed the story i just wanted to say i enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version
i love this book in conjunction with perricone 's books they compliment each other nicely a great tweak to feeling and looking better
for those of you who might find the first found book or this second one offensive in its content guess what life is offensive and for that matter life is also often tragic poignant ironic hysterically funny random and sometimes all of these things at once the found '' books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life that 's what makes it so remarkable indeed how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages this work by davy rothbart jason bitner and all the found crew deserves praise because this is a of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials if several thousand years from now android zombie archeologists study our current century they might go through our trash think of found '' as giving them a headstart

john lynch wrote a classic in revolutions he masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of latin america from spain the book starts in rio de la plata and ends in mexico and central america curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the creole ruling class the reluctance of spanish monarchy and later even of liberals led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the creoles spanish born in america for all of those who are interested in a better understanding of latin american societies of today this great book is a must lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the hispanic american societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis two thumbs up

i recommend that most people do not read this book if you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on amazon jewish history religion culture and humor although the last is perhaps redundant memory folk lore the english language love the nature of histories sex death pain narrative style and voice the multiplicity of human and likewise jewish experience imagination i will assert because i hope it is true that you do n't need to all of these things to enjoy illuminated '' but you do need to be familiar with some of it and you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it all those with need not bother cracking the spine however even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you everything may be indeed sadly obfuscated '' or perhaps less disappointingly only partly obfuscated if so do n't get angry do n't curse the gods or creative writing programs and certainly if you are going to write bad reviews on amazon preface it first with your own faults as a reader lastly buck up read another book even the bible another little book high up on the best seller 's list is not for everyone and for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of illuminated '' that is fine dismiss it at least please do n't take the advice of any other critic here who speaks in an equally perturbed voice moreover do n't read it for the reviews actually stop reading reviews now

it 's been several years since i read the book saw it recently the book seems to be a favorite of the talky chattering left crowd however all this at talk of a just society '' and the underprivileged '' can and does mean only one thing a police state anytime a theory '' attempts to create a utopian state there will be coercion anytime there is coercion you will infringe upon individual rights freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom to govern one 's own life instead of a police state '' in the form of a theory of justice he should have written a book titled a theory of liberty '' any society without liberty as the foundation will have coercion and hence the destruction of liberty however this book remains the favorite rawls was an ivory tower pinhead '' a brief bio states that he was a professor all his adult life what kind of adults spend their whole life having fake phony welfare for intellectual jobs like being a professor of political theory what dat oh please get a real job 1. those can not do will teach so much for the ivory tower pinhead a theory of justice will lead to a police state a state of coercion what we need is theory of liberty
another beautiful contribution by this author love letters to make you weep smile laugh and imagine or remember how it feels to love and be loved

i 've been a sendak junkie since i was a kid his books have always been among my very favorites and i 'm happy to say they 're among my kids ' favorites as well i also love so i was really excited to learn about this book and i must say my expectations have been surpassed the story line is very simple a young child looks for his mommy encountering various monsters along the way and defeating them in creative ways there are only a few written words in the book but the story that the pictures tell is wonderful what child would n't be delighted by a book in which a kid defeats the wolfman by pantsing him nosferatu gets a binky ! and there 's a ton of detail in the pictures as well my girls like to spend several minutes looking at each page spread then there are the this book is really a paper engineering marvel the bits are enormously detailed and full of movement my favorite part is when the boy unwraps the mummy it 's an understatement to say the are spectacular the only reservation at all i have about this book is that my kids will probably love it to death like another reviewer i think i 'm going to buy them their own copy and keep one for myself ! if you have the least interest in sendak or or think you might buy this book
first a few words about each of the four different stories the man in the black suit '' 3 stars this is a story about a boy who meets the devil himself it 's a very scary experience for the boy especially because his older brother died the year before and now the devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way this is the weakest of the four stories because the devil although being scary does n't really come across as a serious threat what kind of devil is it that ca n't even catch a boy who decides to run away from him in everything 's eventual '' stephen king writes that this story won a prestigious best short story '' award in 1996 much to his surprise that surprises me too because in my opinion this story is not that great all that you love will be carried away '' 5 stars this is the shortest story only 35 minutes and one of the two best ones in this collection alfie zimmer is a traveling salesman in the american midwest he has an amazing hobby and he 's tired of life but if he commits suicide what will everyone think of his hobby what makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives alfie 's strange hobby is also captivating as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren midwest in everything 's eventual '' stephen king admits that alfie 's strange hobby was actually something he did himself ! the death of jack hamilton '' 4 stars this is a very unusual story for stephen king it tells a mythical '' story about the 1934 death of jack hamilton member of the john dillinger gang homer van meter another gang member purportedly tells the story john dillinger jack hamilton and homer van meter were all real people you can find a lot of interesting background information about them by doing an internet search for john dillinger despite the fact that these were all ruthless gangsters we find ourselves sympathizing with them stephen king 's approach to the story is that gangsters are also human beings the slow death of jack hamilton and the efforts of john dillinger to get him medical help and dillinger 's distress as jack hamilton 's condition worsens are powerful images that feeling you can only say what it is in french '' 5 stars this is the best story in the collection carol was brought up as a strict catholic but then during the first years of her marriage to bill she had an abortion now she and bill are supposed to be celebrating their wedding anniversary and carol is being subjected to a horrendous punishment for what she did what makes the story fascinating is that it is not god who is punishing carol no it is carol under the influence of her catholic upbringing who has prescribed her own punishment and this punishment carol is inflicting on herself is much worse than a benevolent god would come up with even assuming that god considers what carol did to be wrong in summary two very good stories one good one and one that 's just the four stories are read by four different professional readers the total running time is approx 3 hours 40 minutes not 4 hours as specified on the packaging all four of these stories are included in the book everything 's eventual '' along with 10 other short stories by stephen king if you want to save money or if you dislike audio books then everything 's eventual '' is a better deal rennie peterse
fascinating exploration into the physics of cooking written in an engaging and detailed style probably better for the scientist who cooks than for the cook who 's into science since the language is sometimes a little dense for the layperson worth working through though if only for the gorgeous and elegant formula for figuring out how long to boil your eggs to get them exactly right one caveat the author is british and recipes measurements and terms are geared for the cook this means you 'll find a complete explanation of sausage rolls and nothing about popcorn just fyi

every page is an eye opener the author has done an excellent job revealing the side of hillary that has so long been hidden i think america could do better by picking a different first woman president someone with some morals and a love of our country she has neither it is an important first '' that should withstand the test of time historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character her child was always placed last the only time hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light how did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time they did not even own property when they '' became president there are still a lot of questions to be answered and many more books to be written about this family 8 years of these two is quite enough

a very good and indept look at andrew jackson the author was very thorough including a very good look at early century american andrew jackson 's a contraverisal president on the good side he defeated the british at the amazing battle of new orleans help in expanding into the west a great soldier clearly loved his wife rachel enough to duel to defend her and was probably the only president who could threaten a state with military force if it tried to leave the union and tough enough to make it happen on the flip side his percusion of indians the trail of tears his many duels makes him a very complex and sometimes hard to understand person but still a great biography
although the original elements of style was written in 1919 or earlier it still holds true that anyone who wants to learn how to write in a clear and concise manner will benefit from this book after reading this book you 'll know to avoid breaking elementary rules and principles that are made in writing excessive use of adjectives and adverbs writing in the passive voice using different tenses in writing using the improper case of pronouns example using who '' when whom '' should be used and vice versa one of the most important things that the writer stands to gain from this book is an improvement in his writing style after reading this book you will know how to write in a way that comes naturally write with nouns and pronouns not superfluous adverbs and adjectives write and then rewrite but do not overwrite and overstate use orthodox spelling do not explain too much avoid fancy words be clear do not inject opinions use figures of speech sparingly and countless other helpful techniques to say that this book should be required reading for all writers is an understatement this book should be required reading for anyone that writes
i have read almost all of greg bear 's books and loved eon and eternity as well as the forge of god and anvil of stars i found legacy a little disappointing compared to eon and eternity which preceded them the narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters and not much time on the technological concepts of the flaw and gate openers which i missed i did finish this book and at times was quite spellbound by it not bear 's best work but a if you have read eon and eternity
someday i would love to travel to the places that ann rule writes about ! as she is so discriptive i usually feel like i have known these places and the people she writes about although i have never been these cases she presents in no regrets are as real to me as if i 'd known them and felt the sorrow of their loss ! my personal favorite was a very bad usually like her christmas ones like black christmas in ! i have always planned to review all her books of which i own they are all wonderful and amazon has them just buy them you 'll be glad you did
my only caveat about this otherwise enjoyable installment in the eve dallas series is that the web site did not prominently state i missed it ! that this had previously been published as part of an anthology i made the mistake of only checking the publishing date decided it was a new novella published independently as would be deserved given the track record of the series and ordered it without checking further my bad but a reminder to readers who want to buy everything from the series be sure to read the description carefully enough to determine whether it is a item !
i 've been staring at a copy of thomas friedman 's 'from beirut to jerusalem ' on my shelf for nearly a year now meaning to read it but always drawn to something else finally recent events demanded that i learn more and i finally pulled it down dusted it off and read it i 'm so glad i did especially now the book is not the easiest read since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics which gets complex no matter what you do friedman 's writing style however goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant what i really appreciated about the way friedman presents his story is that it really is his story he is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation and so he picks up on many details others might miss such as the faces of israeli soldiers or the opinions of lebanese taxi drivers but still the story is told mainly through events he observed directly he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the middle east as it is today he tells it in both large and small terms from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region the result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region particularly in the 1980 's a critical decade of events i also appreciated friedman 's fairness throughout the book from his perspective on the lebanese government to the palestinian intifada to the israeli occupation to the american involvement in the region he deals with all of the players fairly whether big or small famous or unknown that 's not to say he does n't have criticisms certainly he has plenty to say about everyone but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other friedman 's willingness to observe with an unbiased eye and ear is key to the strength of this book even with the newer added chapters dealing with the late 1980 's and early 1990 's this book can not be considered a complete '' history of the middle east or even of the events of the last 50 years however it is not meant to be that i think what friedman has documented here is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about how we got to where we are today in lebanon and israel and palestine the book is not an end in itself but for someone who wants to learn more about the region that is in the news almost every day this is an excellent place to start the only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn from them as such 'from beirut to jerusalem ' should be required reading today

my son 34 is currently incarcerated he asked for this book so i had it sent to him he holds on to it for dear life and swears had he read this years ago it would have changed his life for the better and he would n't be where he 's at he raved so much he insisted i order one for myself i did in summary what i derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first otherwise you 'll be no more than a stepping stone for others it 's a good book but i oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by years fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son it 's a bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them

dorothy parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past her wit is biting and at it 's best in this collection favourite reads are for the individual to decide however for me as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle
i rented this book from the library about a year or so ago i loved it ! i 'm back here now i 'm putting it on my wishlist for christmas ! i want to read it again and again i 'd never read erica jong or anything about sappho i saw erica on the daily show and they talked about this book and i ran to the library you should buy this book ! greatness
this book is like a long short story that centers around danny and a period that he is at yale he and his friends are preparing for a big party the book goes on to follow danny as he tries to start a relationship with polly who is sometimes on sometimes off in her relationship with one of her professors while remembering about a local girl back home named cindy who he kind of left in the lurch after they finally went all the way just before danny is ready to go home for spring break and work on his father 's mobile lunchmobile cindy arrives at the school with a big surprise this changes danny 's view on things and makes him numb to the point that he even does n't care when some toughs try to hone in on his father 's lunch route and threaten him danny goes back to school after the break and after resolving his issues with cindy to attend the big bash that his friend matt was planning at the beginning of the book this book like one of his later works little children shows perrota 's talent for creating intriguing characters in such short novels this book like the other seems to end too prematurely and definately screams out for a sequel ! perrota is a super talented writer and i would love to seem him develop a much larger complete novel than leave the audience hanging at the end of another short one
i read 1776 shortly sfter having read mccullough 's john adams so some of the same ground was covered but from a different perspective i found 1776 to be an interesting and smoothly flowing read anyone who has enjoyed and appreciated david mccullough 's other works will enjoy 1776
very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor in the first story he explains his job as an elf at santaland and describes his daily life it is so funny some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time do n't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside but if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time then by all means buy this book
the twist here is that the reader knows while the characters do not in a matter of minutes nine people 's fates are determined by three men sitting in a jail cell simply playing a game '' to pass the time each man names three people he 'd like to see killed when the first man is released three people become a target as he follows through with the game the first in a trilogy dead wrong gets it dead right mara douglas is on one of the men 's list and it 's up to aidan shields to protect her while the book is decidedly light on the traditional sex part of a romantic suspense it is implied i liked both characters and aidan avoids being the atypical surly alpha male with surprising charm and affection i ca n't wait for dead certain which follows the second man as he is released from jail and takes up the gauntlet thrown down by the first man i got this one from the library but i certainly will buy the next two

i read six frigates '' sailing south down the coast of australia from hamilton island in the whitsunday group keen to dodge a storm we did a 48 hour dash down to the safety of yepoon running a 3 hours hours off watch cycle problem was i didnt get any sleep i was too deep inside six frigates back on deck i 'd update my watch on what i 'd just read they loved it sailing by instalments ian toll 's a wonderful writer the man is a time machine he drops you right into the middle of the blood splattered action patrick o'brian fans this is the book for you toll 's also a deft hand at dropping insights that get you thinking like the mention of madison writing to thomas jefferson agreeing that a war with the arab states of north africa could easily be won and in the process stop the attacks on us merchant ships but advises jefferson that the issue will be the cost of then keeping the peace perhaps george w should have a read a little more history at college you 'll taste the sweat and blood and salt on every page best read i 've had in ages and my shipmates agree ! cheers andrew maloney aboard sonne
the author james surowiecki lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly the examples are all easy to relate to and i found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text when i think of crowds i think of unthinking masses moving together led by tradition habit or an individual how can that be wise a more accurate title would be how some groups of people can make better decisions than experts while others act like collective idiots and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups '' although that 's hardly likely to sell as many copies SMILE for me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work i 'd sometimes wondered why i 've been on a few teams that appeared to click '' smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal but our results were n't great whereas other teams have been successful what was it that made a good team i had some of the pieces felt i still had some real gaps in my knowledge this book certainly helped to paraphrase the basic idea that i took away from the book teams of people can achieve superior results if 1 each individual on the team is well informed 2 the work of one individual does not influence the work of another 3 there is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion as simple as they sound there are many ways to fail and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure
this book is fun comical book for children who want to read something mysterious this cute book gives the reader the enthusiasm in turning the pages to see what happens of the young boy going into a creepy house focusing on the search of his mother cynthia marie rizzo author of julie and the unicorn '' and angela and the princess
it 's an easy read and can be applied immediately to you situation the book brings the basics of leadership traits and principles to the reader similar to the military leadership books i 've read in the usmc so many times have i held jobs where a manager although excellent in managing projects through some lack of sensitity or judgement created an uproar that cause moral to fall and people to become resentful and leave there are many stories in the press of managers and ceos restricting bathroom breaks '' playing favorites freezing wages and laying off employees while taking huge bonuses '' like american airlines and enron what 's present here is basic but essential information for anyone in a leadership roll whether at work church functions or managing a family trip this should be required reading for everyone before you find yourself in a situation as leader the boss could be out for a whole month tommorrow can you keep the team working smoothly while the boss is out or is it party time
again jodi picoult is excellent you are truly able to engolf yourself in the characters and thier emotions
i 've read this book four times through the years since i first bought it the love between the two main characters though a forbidden love is so beautiful and magical it made me cry for meggy and father ralph not only is this an unforgettable love story it 's also a great education about sheep farming in australia magnificent description of a then harsh land the dialogue is believable the characters so very real i did n't simply read this book i experienced it when the characters laughed i laughed and when they cried my heart broke for them poor little meggy poor father ralph how bittersweet and memorable i really ca n't get over the quality of this book and the sensitivity of the author review by betty dravis author of a new epic love story 1106 grand boulevar
this book has changed my life it is amazing how much i learned about myself now i understand my wife and other people and i do n't judge them anymore my relations to others is now easear and less stressfull thanks
good analysis of current us vs european international relations written from a conservative perspective as with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot circa of those events but there are two significant underlying assumption in this book first as the single greatest world power the us will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has impact to its strategic goals such as europe throughout the entire cold war southeast asia in the 60 's 70 's and in the middle east today second us historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world rather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the us europe the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current us foreign policy in the middle east plays itself out over the next few decades is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world stay tuned it is a quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights
in some ways km soehnlein 's the world of normal boys reminded me of the teenage novels of paul zindel there is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time zindel wrote specifically for adolescents soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among boys and its social implications although the book is written for adults it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us the world of normal boys is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child the story is seen through the eyes of the victim 's brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism his father goes nuts his sister becomes a religious fanatic and a kleptomaniac and he finds himself smitten with two boys one is todd the athletic and arrogant brother of his confidante who lives next door the other is scott a boy who deals drugs cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him all the characters are vividly rendered if this were ever turned into a film the actress who plays the mother would probably win an oscar just for her final scene in the car this is powerful and emotional writing i found it very moving it 's tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience but i am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people but i will never forget this book five stars
this is a book about beauty passion a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts especially music craves and feels the fire that burns within a book that dares to take one if one dares to take that step on a journey deep into the bare souls of it 's characters the story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot or develops into dramatic changes for the characters that is not what the author wanted to convey and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity and not expect the characters to travel actively without the book gives us these people the town the surroundings it brings us deep into the realities the thoughts the complexities of the human soul the people are good bad ugly beautiful selfish depressed found or lost but from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in mick kelly 's soul and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town then the author reveals her own soul with her words for those that pick up on what her words show i am still amazed at the power this book has any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous for me this book will always be the book that made me capable of understanding how a writer weaves words together with her soul
gods and generals is an extremely well done and fascinating book the author jeff shaara did an excellent job of interpreting the characters his task was a difficult one because his father 's book the killer angels is a classic in the chronicles of civil war stories this book precedes the one written by his father gods and generals takes the reader to the beginning of the civil war and through many of the battles the major players in the story are winfield scott robert lee stonewall jackson winfield hancock and lawrence chamberlain the career biographies of these famous men were striking after reading of their early lives and service experiences it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the union army they were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends i listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by dick estell he brought the characters to life by his narration this book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history
i picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching mystic river the film based on another lehane novel darkness take my hand did not disappoint different characters same setting and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil lehane 's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre lehane 's descriptions jump right off the page at you his characters are so human so intense their dialogue so sharp that it 's almost like watching a movie in your mind there is n't a wasted word in this book the suspense starts to build on page 1 and never lets up becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter this is a read to finish only when you 're not alone in the night lehane 's other works top my summer reading list i 'd love to see what he could do in a different genre
as a parent of an adolescent with asperger syndrome i found this book easy to read and understand with practical instructions and guidelines for preparing my son to enter the work force i really liked the emphasis on developing social and communication skills that are found throughout the book this is one i will recommend to friends and relatives as well as my son 's educators
this book was hard to put n't wait for the next book
oblomov is a guy who never quite manages to do anything he has great difficulties managing to do anything finally a friend manages to convince oblomov that he must be active otherwise he will never escape his laziness the psychology in the story is great the plot is always simple perhaps too slowly progressing there is much humour in this book the characters are truly believable
i loved this book ! the authors share technqiues from carnival barkers magicians and tradeshow pros who know how to grab attention and captivate any audience while some books provide only principles this book gives you magic tricks persuasion mechanisms and techniques that anyone can apply written in a conversational tone this entertaining book tells you the why and the how of persuasion diane diresta author knockout presentation
this book is a wonderful rendition which has important factual information on the tallest man the tripling of the population in the past half century and the spectacular olympus mons on the marsian just to mention a few of the many features contained the book is perfect for student projects in science and the arts it well worth the price charged
gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor on page 16 he writes a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries department buildings and museums then he asks but where is the university '' this is the category mistake '' cartesian question where is the mind '' has a same confusion he asserts a famous epigram ghost in the machine '' is sometimes misinterpreted his point is that there is no ghost '' what we think ghost spirit does not exist therefore ghost ! although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism the british school represented by wittgenstein and ryle had an its apogee in 50 's its crux of reasoning still has an important element i still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic
the concept of mind is a great book for several reasons the main reason to me is that ryle clarifies the concept of being human while he uses language in a natural way in stead of constructing concepts based on for example scientific assumptions he shows what we already see as obvious just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language he is far from reductionistic mark the subtle irony 'man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine he might after all be a sort of animal namely a higher mammal there has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man
different refreshing entertaining funny eye opening better than reading the book is to listen to it buy the audio cd ! on a loooooong

loved this book i think that this is a for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation the only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it working in the field we see the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals i wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal i will say that i cried during parts of the book
by a hypnotism that defies explanation at least by a hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last it was inevitable that they would follow him blindly like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd over the precipice to the destruction of the nation '' this remarkable book is based principally on the captured german documents the interrogations and testimony at the nuremberg trials of german military officers and civilian officials the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left and on shirer 's experience in the third reich shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime europe the book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography a bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect often quoting mein kampf shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times the individual battles are not detailed so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued this is an important book for those interested in germany and life in the third reich at this time the reich rises with a quick run through of hitler 's youth and the german history then the politics and hitler 's megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship the treaty of versais and the fall of the mark lead to germany 's economic fall allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship a new messiah by deceit the military buildup could now begin the coups to overthrow hitler and the nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war for the officers it was either death by hitler or death by fighting the massacres of the russians began soon after the invasion of the east the french and other countries were also caught up in the massacre and william gives us the eyewitness reports the jewish cleansing '' started soon after the nazis took over their first countries the nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation there is an exhaustive lead up to the start of the invasion of poland there was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for britain if invaded not to mention the world and the slaughter of russia the nazi 's pinnacle arrives at about of the way through the book where the fall begins with the allied advance it took military action eventually to stop hitler 's new world order '' not the people the lack of doing anything to stop hitler from walking into the rhineland should not be forgotten does not the blame fall partly on the people chamberlain and the military generals maybe if more would have read mein kampf and not disregarded it 's contents millions would not have lost their lives the nazi propaganda took over the press and soon indoctrinated the german people there were many opportunities to stop hitler by france and britain early on have we not learned anything from the past is there not a parallel in our country the germans imposed the nazi tyranny on themselves '' hegel was one of the many influences on hitler and marx hegel and marxism is still very much alive today in humanism nationalism supreme state '' racism and mysticism
after reading a book of sandra brown 's that i horribly disliked i was hesitant to give her another shot i 'm truly glad i did the witness was a thriller ! the villains in this book are greasy sick individuals that rather turned my stomach just what you like when you want to get a taste of why a person would run for their life ! sandra brown wrote these characters and that of ricki i could easily picture ! particularly well the baby was truly the icing on the cake this infant motivated kendall throughout the book and like any mother lived for the love of her child i also loved the sexy romantic element was just enough that it did n't overwhelm the story even better it did n't change kendall into a mindless goober a state which many female characters in romance '' novels often achieve the witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full rating perhaps it was the crooks they came off a bit cliche but were still necessary characters still this book is an excellent choice with a wow ending very enjoyable
since reading this book in 1994 i have used it as a reference for my life and work using a warm and witty style of writing allen teaches us the physiological and emotional benefits of mirth my favorite chapter title is strike while the irony is hot ! '' so clever ! ! i recommend this book to friends who are facing life challenges and to everyone who attends my workshops on a more personal note since embracing the healing power of humor i felt freer to add a little levity to my aunt alice 's funeral my family was amazingly grateful me too
while not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as aquinas or pannenberg as another review here stresses this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence this is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of scriptural data concerning each topic its apologetic engagement with differing views and its practical counsel for life and ministry it is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions i recommend it highly
my pick for the finest book of 2005 ok smith 's on beauty is up there too we know from page one that we are in the hands of a master craftsmen ! reading ian mcgawen is like watching a great pitching performance it might be slower paced than you 'd like but god is it beautiful fraught with elegance and grace saturday '' is a great read and the work of a true literary giant i highly reccomend this book
book number three in the outlander trilogy the fantasy historical romance of the time traveling claire fraser has claire with her century husband jamie who she left before the battle of culloden in dragonfly in amber a time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and claire has to leave her beloved daughter brianna behind this trip is successful and claire is now plunged into the complicated life of jamie who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the difficulties of the scottish while claire is involved with the difficulties of her with jamie there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in edinborough and the kidnapping of jamie 's nephew claire and jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates voodoo and slave uprisings in the caribbean this colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have claire and jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple one of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured the giggling bouncy chinaman willoughby although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring a note i think the story would have been better without despite its flaws voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise the time travel fantasy is portrayed well in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the century if all you could carry was in your pockets combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest gabaldon 's superior narrative likeable characters and excellent research continue and keep her audience hooked in light of the inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books this is a highly sucessful sequel
this book was stunning i was enraptured with the writing and loved the story so many emotions in one book looking forward to reading more from this author

until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions as rogers clearly points out most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon an inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors in the early 1600 's spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance he told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center antonio damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book the feeling of what happens body and emotion in the making of consciousness '' using damasio and spinoza as a frame of reference it follows that each and every decision we make is based on an emotion not a uniquely quantifiable language infused thought as the popular human interpretation might assume examples of this might be choosing the color of paint a selection from a menu the selection of a mate or which way to turn when unsure animals have provided us with an exhaustive and document able list of emotional behaviors how is it possible to arrive at the conclusion that animals are not conscious when most animals will clearly display behaviors consistent with emotional stimulus the last frontier of computer science is the quest for a conscious entity ray kurzweil has spent the better part of his life predicting the emergence of an exponentially accelerating form of machine augmented human consciousness in my view it would be safer to assume that at some point technology will provide us with means to understand the different levels of consciousness that exist while computers struggle to redefine consciousness by passing turing tests '' visionary ethologists might find ways to interpret the world through different eyes it is exceedingly difficult to discuss the subject of animal consciousness from the point of view of the animal and avoid emotional interpretations lesley rogers has given us a glimpse of this vast subject by asking the correct questions and providing the current objective answers from each available vantage point at a disciplined two hundred pages the book stands out as a concise introduction to the subject of animal cognition
i am a professional photographer and i was looking for a book on lighting technique which this book supplied excellently their step by step approach is easy to follow and understand and all explainations have images attached so you can see what they are talking about they slowly build your general knowledge on how light works rather than supplying specific lighting diagrams allowing and suggesting that you do you to adapt the knowledge to your own use they then go into more detail with difficult lighting subjects such as metal glass and more and how to deal with them my only complaint is that the book is starting to feel a little old especially when they talk about colour it is almost exclusively film based with virtually no reference to digital technology if they were to do an updated version with more emphasis on lighting for digital i would provide 5 stars
this book was so different from what i thought it was about when i ordered it it still was knowledgeable it is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation i also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about it has some examples in the beginning of the book but i hate to keep looking around in books i personally like it to appear in front of me as i read it was a very interesting book to say the least
over the years i managed a staff i grew concerned about the ignorance of basic business behavior among employees asking a new staff member to read a book like this might head off some future conflicts worth a try maybe even highlight some sections that you feel are most important

the insights here are simple straightforward and profound it explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a situation resulting in a feeling of frustration impotence incompetence and depression the only socially acceptable way to express it is rage even though rage is vilified i can tell you that showing hurt pain and weakness invites scorn distain and disrespect even from those who purport to love us by explaining how we get into this trap it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out i wish i could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world i see so much of it played out every day all around us and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage read it before you have a crisis if you can but if you are already in crisis make the effort to read this book even if you ca n't read anything else it might even save your life believe me i know what i 'm talking about

the late ed mcbain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is the gutter and the grave written in 1958 this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten but thanks to hard case crime a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the masters the hero cordell is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he soaked in cheap booze wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception it seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions leaving the reader 's head spinning the novel features mcbain 's usually excellent dialogue the setting is featuring the jazz scene in 1950 's new york there 's humor pathos some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill broadway this little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long i give it my highest recommendation fantastic !

is this a book of new yorker cartoons or a puzzle book well it 's a little of both and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words captions or picture components by figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics crossword puzzles or other word grids the cartoon humor is revealed for the most part the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty although there are a few difficult ones at least for me that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist 's career frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from games magazine and other media that puzzability publishes in the foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between new yorker cartoon editor robert mankoff and new york times puzzle editor will shortz this is an entertaining book that you 'll hate to throw away when it 's been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains enjoy ! eileen riebac
videohound 's cult flicks and trash pics is a book that i consult often not only is it informative but it 's very entertaining reading as well this is a book that any cult movie lover should own if the names roger corman lloyd kaufman ray dennis steckler david lynch frank henenlotter jack hill herschel gordon lewis dario argento paul bartel russ meyer terry gilliam alex cox edward wood ken russell george romero and john waters mean anything to you then you need this book in addition to reviews of hundreds and hundreds of cult films the book has lengthy bios of many of the above filmmakers as well as actors and other important cult figures plus there are tons of photos there 's a big specific category index to help you find exactly what you 're looking for and indexes for actors directors and writers one of my favorite features is that nearly every page features a quote from one of the movies featured in the book this is a great book though it 's far from complete lots of movie geeks will be able to look through the book and point out any number of movies that were left out however for every movie you know of that 's not in the book there are probably five that you 've never heard of i recommend cult flicks and trash pics very highly

narrated through the heartfelt voice of amy tan the kitchen god 's wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and as a young chinese woman winnie louie the main character and the conduit through which tan expresses her voice must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband wen fu a pretentious arrogant and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder but also committed numerous felons including rape murder blackmailing and extortion day after day beating after beating winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from wen fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love radical and immediate actions must be taken when dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency someone like wen fu the usual traditional and orthodox actions are futile striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of winnie unfolds itself relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty against the magnificent backdrops of a china the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations regardless of race nationality or social status as you read this rare gem amount literature open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart
imagine you 're attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you 're doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water in essence fire your boss '' is just that stephen pollan 's discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of careering '' in not just corporate america but any occupational arena it 's an easy conversational and straightforward read that imho should be called hire your boss '' pollan a life coach with the style chutzpah and hubris of a donald adams hybrid elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic boss pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it 's helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations simply put managers will continue to act purely out of rather than an alignment with organizational objectives with this in mind what will avail those of the cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision with more of a hired gun '' approach rather than that of a sycophant many of pollan 's precepts will at first seem counterintuitive such as work for the money the love will follow '' or lose your career get a job '' and may come across as trite and cynical however when taken in context the underlying schema is this a job is a means of providing more no less trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for the author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market although pollan drives across some salient points about the contemporary world of work he does tend to oversimplify a bit with regards to some management behavior furthermore some of his coping strategies have the guise of tactics that only a new york attorney could formulate is a new york attorney in sum this is as an island of sanity in a sea of be a star at work '' banter that perpetuates the syndrome finally when you boil this down you realize that one as an employee should consider themselves i find it a good affirmation of what work really should be and a refreshing rebuttal to all the careering pundits whose success is predicated on the management 's mystification of office life not for the faint of heart !
i liked this book but i notice that all the critics seem to hate it it did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off i picked it up because walter laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism written in 1886 it suggests that there is a anarchist underground which the protagonist gets mixed up with it is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction the prose is wonderful as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters ' personalities if you have the taste for that sort of thing all in all it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel i finished it with regret i had previously read and liked portrait of a lady which is a superior novel as much as i liked it i would have to say do not start with princess as an introduction to james incidentally i have a theory about the omniscient narrator in james ' books being a malign demiurge but i will spare you that theorizing here
this was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day this was also my first crichton and i have to say i enjoyed it to the fullest easy to read adventure novel
i think this is harriet lerner 's best book i has the clearest and most helpful chapter on family secrets that i 've ever read the chapter called a funny thing happened on the way to the orifice '' is worth the price of the book the chapter on affairs even though controversial should be helpful to all couples especially if you think your partner will never cheat on you
lost in the funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you are n't in the right mood for it if you are n't in fiction barthelme calvino etc are good reference points you might want to start somewhere else first even barth 's novels are more immediately digestible with that said though this collection does n't really operate on one consistent level perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by barth much earlier in his career the three stories concerning ambrose 's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into with the titular lost in the funhouse '' story which barth is probably most known for from that point on most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader writer and the characters stories like title '' and '' work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction and were for me at least a little tedious the best moments occur when barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good typically based on greek mythology the best of these are the utterly raunchy petitition '' and the labyrinthine menelaiad '' taken as a whole though lost in the funhouse is greatly satisfying even if like me you really only understood about 20 of what barth was talking about on your first it 's the sort of book i 'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor oh and make sure to read barth 's seven additional notes at the front of the book though maybe only after you 've read the story that is being discussed in each note so as not to ruin the initial experience they really help to clarify some of barth 's intentions i ca n't even imagine appreciating a story like glossolalia '' without having read the note concerning it
i already have this book and i am now buying for friends it does speak to all age groups and is magnifying to those of us gals who grew up in the same time anna quindlin writes as if she broke into my body and stole my thoughts my dreams and my memories if so i thank her for the intrusion because she obviously looked around it sometimes takes my breath away the way she puts into words exactly what i feel i thank her for that but i wo n't ask for royalties
though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read gaston bachelard 's the poetics of space '' bachelard argues that language especially poetry can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space especially of our home space for example he considers how common phrases such as go up to the attic '' and go down to the basement '' are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended as he does with other such observations bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives in addition to exploring how we experience space and place bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight roughly speaking he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something by reading this beautifully written and engaging book you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived grown up felt comfortable or alienated had a feeling of wonder or fear etc i recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space in language and what it can reveal to us or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language

i was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of nebula award winners this book is not at all your typical sf story indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some sf aspects than it does an sf story i 'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction so this holds a good deal of appeal for me griffith 's prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction her characterization is also near perfect i wo n't spend time discussing the plot as that 's been handled amply by the other reviewers but i will echo one other person 's thoughts the storyline that has lore working at a sewage plant is surprisingly every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing to me that says a good deal about griffith 's talent as a writer as for the sex scenes which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book not each but in total additionally they 're not placed in the story without purpose overall an excellent book personally i 'm quite glad that it won a nebula it 's certainly desereving
this is a 4 cd set of meditations as a companion to the inner temple of witchcraft book using the background of the book the cd 's set up an easy way to work with the material in the book without having to open the book to reference it during the mediations penczak 's voice is perfect as far as i am concerned it does not grate on you nor does it lull you into sleep the light melodic fill is just that filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words i found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book if you find the book to be what you are looking for the cd 's are a good addition i enjoyed the entire presentation and penczak gives us some very well based and solid material boudic
a wonderful story of how even our smallest action can have great consequences that we ca n't even understand a long book with fantastic memorable characters my favorite of these characters were the two brothers who were fixated on serial killers and natural disasters this is the only way they know how to cope with the outside world will certainly get your money 's worth enjoy this one
have you ever been tempted to write pure nonsense maybe on some rainy first day of april i once felt like writing '' i sure made a mistake when i told the goddess minerva that she could n't square the circle in response she drew a circle next to me a truly beautiful and perfect circle and right in front of my panicky brown eyes she turned pi into four ! not just the circumference divided by the diameter but the series expansion as an inverse tangent as well what would she do next make me unwell by dropping the first letter from my first name i tried to apologize but it was too late '' i was not the only one to dream of mangling pi in contact a novel '' carl sagan went me one better when he had aliens send messages to each other at infinite speed by hiding them in a numerical representation of pi and then you guessed it changing pi everywhere ! still alan sokal went beyond even this getting the following published in the journal social text '' '' in this way the invariance group erodes the distinction between the observer and the observed the pi of euclid and the g of newton formerly thought to be constant and universal are now perceived in their ineluctable historicity and the putative observer becomes fatally decentered disconnected from any epistemic link to a spacetime point that can no longer be defined by geometry alone '' sokal put this and many more whoppers into his hoax which defended an equally absurd thesis that physical 'reality ' no less than social 'reality ' is at bottom a social and linguistic construct '' while this joke may not prove much it does raise the issue of whether a few people in academia are misusing the vocabulary of science to create absurd statements in defense of an antirationalist point of view this book shows that they are the authors show that jacques lacan makes completely arbitrary analogies between topology and psychoanalysis we then see some of the same irrelevance and superficial use of topology in the early works of julia kristeva after an interlude in which sokal and bricmont seriously discuss the philosophy of science there are more examples of academic nonsense the next victim is luce irigaray who in what i agree is about as ridiculously antifeminist a statement as one could make says '' science always displays certain choices certain exclusions and these are particularly determined by the sex of the scholars involved '' that 's rich objective truth is different depending on whether one is a woman or a man ! i must admit that i half expected irigaray to say that pi was different for men and women after that we see bruno latour 's idea that einstein 's theory of relativity has implications for sociology the authors point out that this is manifest nonsense were we to discover tomorrow that the ratio of the mass of a particle to its energy were slightly different from what relativity predicted there would be a revolution in physics but no need to alter theories of human behavior later we see jean baudrillard say it is a sign that the space of the event has become a hyperspace with multiple refractivity and that the space of war has become definitively '' and there are more um words from gilles deleuze felix guattari and paul virilio sokal and bricmont conclude that all this inanity is a threat that either it will lead to even more irrationalism in academia or to an academic abandonment of social critique and i think it 's worth warning us to avoid such a future but i also think we simply need social journals to get scientists to review and reject papers that use big scientific words instead of making coherent statements

peggy noonan 's reagan has the texture of truth unlike a recent reagan bio by richard reeves that has the texture of slime noonan 's reagan is not hagiography it 's clean and palpably honest i feel noonan 's honesty just as i felt the incredible lightness of reeves ' shallowness noonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as ronald reagan lay dying now that he 's gone peggy noonan is our era 's great communicator not every word of when character was king is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time a few of her words do n't fit and an occasional fact is flubbed but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man a description also used fittingly for dwight eisenhower noonan i believe is the only biographer of president reagan who understands the import of a footnote an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or like reeves has learned to diminish that 's the patco strike which as noonan shows had implications by the force of his focus president reagan used patco to reassert mastery in our twilight struggle with an evil empire that was evil and that was an empire thank god we had reagan at a moment of maximum danger thank god he had noonan to tell his story

cahill 's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste this is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained some missing context some missing closure and they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense as stories may focus on nature archaeology sociology etc while the book can not be construed as an outdoor reference there is good information ex wisdom '' of cave diving some stories hit the vicarious adventurer 's sweet spot the author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in kentucky engaging the reader with educational content ex barometric effect on air flow spectacular descriptions ex lightening igniting bat guano and hair raising suspense ex getting lost in a maze of passages not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits
by far a very thorough and intelligent read i could not put it down the evidence that pyramids all over earth from a lost epoch of man align to specific star clusters is overwhelming in my opinion does n't take a phd to realize that if something looks like a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck chances are it 's a duck everthing is presented via full color images and in an easy to comprehend format it has changed my perspective and at the same time answered many questions for me personally and of course will raise many more ! an absolute must read
spring snow '' is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right it is an eloquent moving story with a tale as old as time '' that of lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations in another culture with another writer this would be a romantic if not happy story but this is japan and the writer is mishima yukio in his hands the lovers kiyoaki and satoko transcend literary stereotypes and become agents of their own happiness and destruction by the very nature of their relationship raised together since childhood playing a complicated game of love and sexual tension their future is never in doubt it is impressive that a writer such as mishima known for his politics and his samurai dreams could craft such a tender love story while knowing the eventual conclusion the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between kiyoaki and satoko and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared not that it is a clear path even knowing japanese literature and the road it usually takes there are surprises on the way things do not turn out the way one would expect i was incredibly moved by spring snow '' it is a novel that affects the heart of the reader and lingers long after the last page is turned
i read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market the phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half the raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the new era '' story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay but as shown by proven evidence of the past no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later when this happens the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible the story so far is quite simple but what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained the combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book for bubbles to happen information flow is the key media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media in recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one 's luck if a casino is far away backed by dedicated news channels and internet trading well it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds in such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and ratios take a backseat as explained by the author historical averages are breached and a euphoria of once in a life time opportunity '' prevails what happens to the efficient markets theory in such situations since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there can not be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing this book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory it is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income pension funds for example are getting diverted into risky markets here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets the bubble in the housing market is also discussed well housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon but nevertheless the damage can be the same the party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble what goes up has to come down ! but once you start reading this book it is difficult to put it down intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding
a late divorce is one of my very favorites novels this ordinary tale about the late divorce of a couple one of whom is in a mental institution is told from the perspective of each member of the family children their spouses and mates grandson etc i have rarely laughed so much or been touched so much by the insightful description of the kaminka family and their travails over a failed marriage real estate and conflict the scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity at its best a wonderful work original illuminating and funny
i agree with the first reviewer this is what art criticism politically engaged or not should read like berger was an marxist i am an anglosphere conservative he is a man of the left i am of the right no matter his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism and at times philosophy that i have read incredibly perceptive sensitive without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended he uses history but is not a historicist for he lets the works reveal themselves openly the essay that which is held '' a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of time '' is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of montaigne berger will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary europe danto and the americans are simply not in his league
i have enjoyed all of david gemmell 's work but this one takes the prize it contains sorrow great sacrifice courage honor and some of the best battles every written it is easy to see the scenes and the people as you read the characters are ones you will become attached to if you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day you will love this book
in order to properly understand the jesus of the new testament instead of making a jesus of our own liking it is necessary to understand jesus as he himself indicated jesus himself according to the new testament made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures old testament as he sought to explain himself his actions his teachings and his significance understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what jesus was and is about this means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole christopher wright 's book knowing jesus through the old testament is an absolute godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the jesus of the new testament this book is a little bit technical at times it is not a devotional work but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of jesus thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of jesus according to the background that jesus himself referred to thanks chris wright for this fabulous book also see his forthcoming book the mission of god due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press it looks to be another bullseye ! ! for some other great little books on jesus that are sane and sober see jesus and his world by peter walker the original jesus by wright and for a bit of a larger work see jesus and the gospels by craig blomberg

a comprehensive entertaining and plainly written introduction to critical thinking it should be in every school and public library preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with caveats my only complaint is the title perhaps it should have been called the critical thinkers ' reference '' so as not to confuse those poor mites who can not differentiate between rational thought and cartesian skepticism of course if your is not based on rational thinking and evidence then the knowledge contained in this book may make you feel uncomfortable you may even feel threatened to the point that you negatively review it guys as robert park once said alas to wear the mantle of galileo it is not enough that you be persecuted by an unkind establishment you must also be right '' please read this book or even read the faq on carroll 's website and learn how to reason

the mysterious oriental mirror is ugly and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected it wreaks havoc and sometimes kills as is the case with several people in this book the rest are either thought mad or driven mad question if you could would you switch places with somebody else in a different time i think i might but i would like to be given a choice brandy mccabe and her granddaughter shay garrett are n't given that choice both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other 's bodies marlys millhiser has woven a complex and fascinating story of culture shock in which brandy becomes her granddaughter and shay becomes her grandmother shay is thought crazy in the early because she can tell the future and she keeps a diary to tell her grandmother how she has lived out her life should she return to her own body one day her story and how she deals with a boulder colorado is the most interesting segment of the book but i did n't feel sorry for shay as much as i admired her strength of character she also had her mother 's stories of her ancestors to go on but this was not the case for poor brandy the garrett 's and shay 's fiancee ' do n't know what to do with a pregnant shay who is terrified and clueless about the year 1978 but they know after discovering the diary that she really is brandy the story is often heartbreaking often times quite funny and there are so many supporting and unforgettable characters like the lovable thora brandy 's first and the old man who takes care of shay when she runs away from her family that this book is not only compelling but also makes you think about your own place in this world what shay and brandy do have in common is rachel brandy 's daughter and shay 's mother now picture those two being in each other 's place when you think of that ! somebody here called the book a literary classic i would n't go that far but it is excellent regardless the mirror is magical storytelling any way you look at it so let it weave it 's spell on you

having read katherine i wanted to get my hands on another anya seton novel her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the medieval and renaissance eras are breathtaking people recommended green darkness because of its timeless romance historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation so i gave green darkness a whirl this enormous book a big trade paperback with over pages enthralled me from beginning to end and i wish it had been longer that the magic had n't ended despite its rather large size and intricate story the novel ended too soon for me i like big books but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume i finished this gem in three sittings the novel 's setting begins in the late around the year this was first published richard mardson takes his beloved wife the american heiress celia taylor to his estate in sussex england there he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers all respectable noblemen and women like richard but something strange begins to happen between them celia is experiencing deja vu as though she 'd been there before this happens the second she enters the castle at the same time richard becomes restless and moody celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her their lives and their marriage could be in shambles and celia has to go back to her previous life during tudor england to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time her past life is a woman named celia bohun who falls for a handsome monk named stephen richard mardson their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering there are many twists throughout the novel i have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done celia and stephen 's love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time this novel brought me to tears by the time i finished the building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable celia is a very complex heroine she is proud and innocent but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it especially when stephen is involved stephen is a tall dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion but his attraction to celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him this part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result the part in which celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel it has a mixture of eroticism and innocence for it is the first time celia sees stephen 's nude body the romance is indeed wonderful but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable we experience all of the things that occurred during tudor england from henry viii 's reign passing on to queen mary and onto queen elizabeth i have been reading quite a lot of novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure you feel the time period and the events that took place in those times the most insightful things for me were those centered on queen mary 's persecution of protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on celia 's love for stephen the ending is one of the best endings i have read green darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own the story is quite intricate not an easy read by a long shot i find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed there are numerous characters in this novel but i never felt like i had to keep up with them in order to remember them each character serves his or her purpose and i loved them or hated them if they were villains the one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on mabel 's weight i thought plump women were considered prettier in those times and celia the twentieth century one sounds a little too british for an american who 'd set foot in england for the first time other than those negligible details green darkness is perfect anya seton was a great author one of the best in her time i think i like this novel more than katherine i wonder if anya seton and this novel inspired jude deveraux to write remembrance which i read at the same time as this one which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century anyway green darkness is one of the best novels out there and i can not recommend this memorable gem enough
a jules vernes classic this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time true there are some items that may seem a bit dated and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible yet this novel is still a joy to read with a stoic icelander as their guide a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the arctic as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist contrary to popular belief and scientific reality the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno i wo n't serve as spoiler but sufficed to say that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint their instruments a crude electric light and others would be considered art for their time vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body and if you take verne 's theories to heart although modern science refutes them their journey is plausible however i do have a couple minor gripes vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist the rest of the masses myself included probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line also there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with vernes logic during their rapid ascent the details i wo n't reveal the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness the bends '' although it was still a new phenomena at the time i believe vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure as he did during their slow descent into the abyss the nitpicking aside this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time a modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at verne 's vision of a subterranean world nearly a century and a half later vernes ' works still inspire awe and imagination
i was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here even more stunned by the criticisms this is not a scientific treatise and never pretends to be this is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of emergence nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper this is an interesting graspable exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely positively crucial to understand to some people emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field those people were disappointed and found this light reading '' which is really too bad because they are the ones who need this book the most alas we can expect it to be a while before these scientist '' can look outside their own shallow of their to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in both natural and if you did n't find this book exciting you did n't read it sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice let johnson do what he does best take you on a journey of ideas and concepts sure some of it is simplified for the but anybody who is n't a total is going to find the content interesting enough to and search for details on their own it is n't johnson 's goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate his goal is to show what emergence is and why it is so important how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field and how elegant simple complex chaotic and beautiful emergence is ! and he does exactly this quite well if you read this book and are not excited you did n't get it read it again and again look up the examples of emergence and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in your world in your daily experience the enrichment you 'll gain from it will be worth a lot more than any silly in an obscure field of research that nobody has ever hear
a wonderfully told ! the illustrations are lovely and appropriate to the playful theme of the book
i love this cookbook there are so many amazing recipes as someone who is allergic to dairy i am totally blown away at how creamy some of the dishes are besides the recipes the book is filled with beautiful pictures and profound quotes that combine together to create a really special reading experience i highly recommend this cookbook to vegans vegetarians people allergic to dairy and wheat and meat eaters as well
i am a kindda new wife but struggling with learning how to grow up and not be a nag stormie is very easy to understand in her book and can relate to almost anyone like another person said i do feel like this book was written just for me the written prayers help me bc sometimes i dont know how to pray for my husband and this gives u the words to say and scripture to back up everything she says also it helps me more importantly be a better wife this isnt a book to try to get ur way and mold and change ur husband i 'd say its about giving urself up to the lord to change u and make u a better wife and praying for ur husband is selfless and probably one of the most important things u could be doing i highly recommend this book highly it changed me almost instantly !
i have read all of van gulik 's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite the characters are intriguing and some sinister the end is satisfying and bittersweet challenging integrity vs justice i would however recommend you read the others first chronological is good chinese gold murders is first to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own
this is in my opinion john bradshaw 's best book it encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions addictions and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes in this volume john bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families he also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics through affirmations working with feelings visualizations and other techniques the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame as someone who has done the work himself he comes across as compassionate knowledgeable and very practical sometimes i get annoyed when i read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts this is the explanation for my 4 rating along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content therefore my overall rating is that this is a solid classic that certainly deserves its status however prepare yourself for some repetition and unnecessarily long examples of what he is talking about
i love this book ! i love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last i say maybe because originally buddies was supposed to be the last it is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested my love for dennis savage 's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with little kiwi my love for little kiwi 's innocence becomes concern for his actions it 's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result the choices that they make are theirs and there 's nothing you can do about it but let them be chosen it 's hard letting little kiwi grow up and become virgil brown i imagine it 's the same way with a child but at least then you get to see what happens ! mind you the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next but just like just above my head '' by james baldwin which i highly recommend i have been unable to pick up this book and read it again it simply leaves me realing with so many feelings yet i would not trade the experience reading it with anything how does one mix merriment with malaise so well read the book and find out
this book will be invaluable now as i am going to groom my dog myself the instructions are easily understood
i love joanna brady ! however this introduction to her and her life in bisbee is not the best book jance has ever written one thing that is terrific about jance though is that she is from bisbee and describes the town in exact detail bisbee is a quaint crazy town and jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert joanna brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by highly recommended ! !
this is a cute story about a spider who drops in on a farm all the farm animals greet her and invite her to play but the spider spends the day building her web instead the book is fun and informative and not at all scary the pages are doubled so they are easy to turn but be careful because inquisitive little fingers may reach inside the pages and rip them the book has about 350 words
collins ' efforts with his justly famed the moonstone '' and the woman in white '' have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in armadale '' lydia gwilt do n't you love the last name is one of the great unsung characters in english or any western literature collins seems to delight in making her as as attractive to men and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire given the tenor and social conventions of the time her quest for revenge on the despicable alan armadale seems perfectly in keeping lydia gwilt is like an early english scarlett o'hara without the redeeming humor scarlett was known to exhibit all in all an extraordinarily and character study
i evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that i needed more protein than i had thought and that i reacted strongly to sugars i bought this book when i decided to lose a few pounds but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet i was already having gall bladder and liver issues i bought this book first and 2.5 years later it is still the best reference i have the chapter on hormones is a bit technical but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book within three days of eliminating grains from my diet i no longer cared whether or not i lost weight my awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone my energy increased significantly and within weeks i noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone and it has n't come back within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and i started sleeping better the book first describes what low carb nutrition is then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body 's hormones in different ways it addresses overall energy diabetes heart disease cancer gastrointestinal disorders vitamins and minerals and weight control one chapter the rest is on health issues
three of my nephews and my son 's favorite book he wore it out and i had to buy another one
i thought that the two books previous to this in the duncan james series were slight disappointments kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with gemma taking the lead in a dark house is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
this is an excellent book the anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides the authors book on senegal parrots and their family is also full of information
on the surface natsuo kirino gives us a book loaded with page turning suspense what lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in japan women are seen as beautiful young pets or useless old bags kirino shows a side of japan that i did n't know existed kirino 's brilliant characterization makes this book work every person is fleshed out within the context of the story and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary i never felt like the story was on hold while i learned about someone 's childhood i ca n't stand it when writers stop a story cold just to fill in holes that they have created kirino does n't have that problem the book has a bit of a slow start but it is necessary for the author to paint a picure of the mundane world the characters live in before things start to heat up the story picks up momentum and charges through to a brilliant ending i have to disagree with other reviewers who disliked the ending if you do n't like the ending you may be missing the point of the whole book the plot twists manage to surprise the reader without feeling forced kirino 's style is concise and my one complaint is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight because of their similar names with names like yayoi yoshie and yoko it 's hard to know who 's who at times this may show my american ignorance but i have to admit that this was a problem for me this minor complaint aside i loved this book and i highly recommend it to all fans of crime fiction
as a therapist 16 yrs i have been using the material in this book for reframing the experience of depression for my clients the clients i have introduced this book to are now reframing their illness as an intiation into a greater understanding of their relation to while at times dry for most laypeople it has become a reference book for my practice
in response to the guy who said this book is n't scientific '' i say it 's as scientific as the diagnosis which is essentially a catalog of behaviors that annoy teachers but i digress there 's no scientific proof that adhd actually exists as a disorder since we do n't understand the brain or why it does things how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start the book is worth your time but you should also check out hallowell or ingersoll
among all the theories of ethics with which i am familiar i have always found kant 's system to be the best carrying out one 's duty for the sake of the duty itself the problem with kant however is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity dependent on a source of which we can never some may claim have any understanding christine korsgaard fixes at least for me this problem by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality in short the source of normativity is our humanity itself i do n't want to get into too much details and give away the main points of the book suffice it to say that it offers in my opinion some of the best arguments for the objectivity of morality the conclusion i reached after reading the book was this it is as much justified for a human to complain 'why should i be moral ' as it is for to complain 'why should i have two eyes ' in both cases the answer is 'because you are a human being a social animal with two eyes '
highly recommended ! the text is engaging and very informative clear possibilities for implementation
i really enjoyed this book it was a few good laughs over a few good dumps what else can a goomba ask from a book sittin ' on the back of the cammode
i found lovemaps a valueable and insightful look at the way individuals relate to sexual behavior and establish their sexual identify and desires based on life experiences which as money indicates occurs in childhood and which is unconsciously formed by the individual i found this book extremely helpful while working on my doctorate in human sexuality and now 6 years later as i continue my research and work as a sexologist and sex therapist i highly recommend this book to other sexologist and clinicians as well as any man or woman who is interested in learning more about sex and sexual behavior and in essence more about themselves it definitely helps if you read a book before judging it and this book should be in everyone 's sensual library '' live with passion charley ferrer author of the latina kama sutra the journal for the sensual woman para la mujer sensual el kama sutra latino the passionate latina in our own words

wells wrote the time machine 1895 rather furiously it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel summing it up in a tightly constructed very short novel most works that i have read from the nineteenth century are effluviums this one is short and for once i would have liked a book a bit wordier anyhow the narrator a sort of mad tinkerer describes his visit years to the future he finds two distinct inheritors of the human race one smallish but joyful class of vegetarian people that live on the surface of the earth the eloi and one larger class of photophobic ground dwellers that perform most of the work for the eloi but unfortunately also eat them gone are most of the trappings of modern society humans have devolved into beautiful idiots and those that prey upon them darwin 's theories of evolution and natural selection were just beginning to take hold at the time wells was writing and they obviously influence the work i read somewhere that wells took a university course taught by the biologist huxley who highly regarded darwin 's theories socialism also influences the book with the morlock underclass literally kept in the dark until they devolve into creatures that can not tolerate light and have to rely on human flesh for food part of socialist theory is conflict theory so instead of cannibalizing their own the morlocks eat the eloi as a sort of vengeance darkness and the use of the dark as something mysterious from out which monsters may jump is gothic old hat for early writers of this genre wells uses the dark as the place where the morlocks are banished and where the believes the morlocks have his stolen time machine we feel the gothic fear when he knows he has to go down there to attempt to get it back also i would n't say wells is the first to blend science with fiction either see hawthorne 's rappaccini 's daughter '' mary shelley 's frankenstein or edgar allan poe and is there something unsettling about the 's undertaking with the childlike weena her death at the hands of the morlocks is tragic but imagine the she would make if the narrator brought her back to his time as he intended
rose madder was one the first books that got me hooked on stephen king this story is phenomenal in my opinion i have to admit the first time i read it i was a little confused i was not one to be to much into sci fi '' fantasy type stuff this like any good story or movie is best when it is read a few times then you really get to pick up the subtle hints that you may have missed before then again i am a bit biased rose madder is right at the top of my list of most favorites just below bag of bones
i picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading instead i was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until i 'd read most of it the main character in my opinion is janet the mother i think it 's more or less in her voice and that is why she is the most developed character the book was very funny in an oh no ! '' kind of way sure there are some outrageous stories and some things may seem unlikely to some people they are lucky i guess i for one can really relate to the dysfunctional family and to a lot of the characters but it is n't meant to be a character study or some huge philosophy assignment it 's meant to entertain you while you pass some time reading and it does that just fine

i got my copy of the five keys to value investing '' as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor he thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before i start my career on wall street i was not disappointed the five keys is a very good summary of what i learned in business school and much much more the author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like buffett and graham the experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile but what makes this book very special is the framework i have read several investment books over the years but none like this one putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw in addition reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work the clarity in the concepts and the '' tone was particularly attractive to me in sum this is a very coherent practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective considering the authors ' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing
when i first started reviewing children 's books on i gave myself a long list of rules to follow and one of those rules stated that i was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until after i 'd written my own review i wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure filled only with my own thoughts which i obviously mistook to be brilliant and feelings after a while though i gave up on this rule by and large and this is not speaking for all reviews just 90 of them a review for a children 's book goes something along the lines of it was good my requests it every night buy this book '' nothing too shocking or revealing so i grew lazy i started reading other reviews of picture books long before i sat down to actually write a review of my own just moments ago i went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book martin 's big words '' this book was on my list of because it had garnered itself a caldecott honor years before so i went to the appropriate page much as you are now and read the first review on the list at the time it was an unassuming july 18 2002 review entitled there 's something wrong here '' i read the review i digested the review and i came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones ones that i should consider dare i say in my own review this is unprecedented never has a review for a book a children 's book really hit home for me like this one did so to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002 i commend you and to myself a mental whipping for breaking my own rules it 's a hard act to follow but i 've a point or two of my own to make and i 'm gon na make now as a children 's librarian i get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around january or just before requesting books on martin luther king for the older children such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill but for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies the choices are limited fortunately there 's martin 's big words '' a beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man the book shows martin as a child first encountering the insanity of segregation we see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance following this are small looks at the 1955 montgomery bus boycott civil rights marches and his 1964 nobel peace prize finally while marching with striking garbage collectors a fact not often mentioned in children 's biographies of king he was shot and killed says the book at the end his big words are alive for us today '' the book is stunning to look at you know the endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown peach amber and umber stained glass taken together the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful using collage illustrator bryan collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the sixteenth street baptist church in the rest of the book collier 's images leap off the page they 're bright colorful and eclectic combined with author doreen rappaport 's elegant eloquent narrative children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind king 's life and actions so what about the complaints of this book let 's examine them fully first of all one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display none of whom are either white or female this is true and it is a little odd not odd just odd from looking at the picture i can only assume that collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and did n't notice that it was a bit skewed the other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill king i dunno the book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races as for the lack of positive white images i admit they 're not present in this particular book however the world is filled to overflowing with books that do present positive images of white people as a white person myself i 'm sick to death of 'em and i 'd gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as martin 's big words '' so yeah the book has a flaw here or there but it also fills a need however important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the freedom marches is your prerogative but do n't pass martin 's big words '' by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the in your eyes it 's a great book with a great message it 's also one of the few king bios that 'll capture your 's attention for longer than a minute a great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man
i loved this book i love it so much i want to give copies to my sisters my friends and to get my husband to read it the ideas seem so simple and straight forward that when you read it you say of course i can do that in my life '' much of it covers identifying your goals focusing on those and affirming that you can achieve them i found it very rational and not just wishful thinking i really like the exercises included in some chapters one exercise was to write a description of what would be a your perfect day he explains the purpose of each exercise and ask direction for carrying it out it 's the type of book that can be sampled and parts at intervals to reinforce your efforts for a happier life

there are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade but at least in terms of the international movement of capital you 'll usually find mere boosterism and ideology at last paul blustein has given us a look at the effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation here we have an and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of argentina 's economy in which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship you wo n't be surprised to see the word bubble '' regularly as blustein covers the surprisingly factors that added up to disaster over several years with many mistakes made by all parties along the way in addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within argentina itself blustein also explains errors made by the imf and the clinton and bush administrations and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions not to mention argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure rewards for speculators plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts i would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters as bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates international debt and equity markets and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply if you 're an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around the world will raise all ships you might have your worldview shot down by blustein and his excellent look at argentina 's misery

i enjoyed this novel it was n't hiaasen 's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read hiaasen has the ability to look at the lower end of society and bring out the humour in how they conduct their lives in this novel two people win the lotto ordinarily this would be a cause for celebration but when one of the winners bemoans the fact that they have to share their spoils with another and they are white supremists then the adventure starts the shenanigans of the characters is both humourous and engrossing this is a book that i recommend
only about two hundred pages jonathan spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful mysterious fascinating and frightening persons of the twentieth century though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of mao 's life or policies it is best to look elsewhere this book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of mao 's life and work and ideas perfect for people curious about mao and twentieth century china who want to read more than an abstract but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work just the facts and little commentary spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences

through forster 's impressive command of the english language and advanced character development the story of helen margaret schlegel unfolds the sisters who are highly educated pensive and artistic become entangled with the wilcox family practical unilateral capitalists and the basts working class and unassuming however the initially subtle differences between the sisters and how they approach love misfortune and personal relations become more obvious as the novel progresses climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a english novel i think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end human nature notwithstanding the novel 's refinement gorgeous writing and riveting prevail to the end i loved it !
the narrator of joe perrotta 's novel joe college '' is danny an english major at yale stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named polly danny struggles to complete his junior year while home in new jersey on a summer break danny drives his father 's lunch wagon the roach coach '' and this is how he meets cindy a pleasant chatty secretary danny compares her to the girls on the yale campus and the comparison is not flattering to cindy he 's faintly embarrassed by her and while she 's ok to date when he 's home in new jersey he 's ashamed of the relationship when he returns to yale once again perrotta presents the theme of escape from new jersey and in the novel danny 's escape is temporarily through yale but ultimately through education cindy represents everything danny is trying to escape a lifetime driving the roach coach and danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in new jersey class is another theme in the novel during the school year danny works in a cafeteria the employees and the townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out whereas the yale students seem to have vast limitless opportunities while danny 's background is humble and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to yale he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes to them yale does n't quite hold the desperate stakes that face danny when it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices danny nakedly examines his motives and simply shrugs while this does not make danny a heroic narrator it certainly makes him very real and very human as a perrotta fan i hope that the author rediscovers danny in another novel in joe college '' danny 's moral fibre is still quite plastic and he may prove to be fascinating in middle age displacedhuma

i just finished my second reading of it i really can not add much to the great reviews already written i 've always loved dickens ' way with words and this book is a treasure in that department the english the era the characters the countryside it got to the point where i could n't wait for the evening to come so i could continue reading this also seems to me to be an important cornerstone book '' for other great english literature the theme though just a seed for scrooge in a christmas carol begins here in a story called the goblin who stole a sexton a story related during one of pickwick 's christmastime visits to a friend in the country when reading the wind in the willows or tolkien 's works i can not escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm the sense of humor okay humour duty to friends and the simple but most important things in life which dickens so impressively describes the only negative thing is that i discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that i was free from the drudgery of daily work was retired with ample monetary means of course like pickwick himself and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings adventures and pursuits an excellent book
i first read this extraordinary book in 1986 just two years after it was first published picking it up again i find it eerily applicable to our current situation there is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it the march of folly brings this message back to the forefront barbara tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests mind you this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous and yes i admit right readily that hindsight is beginning with the trojans and their acceptance of the trojan horse to benighted papal policy during the renaissance to britain 's stupidity during the american revolution to questionable american policy during the vietnam war the march of folly invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does given our current war policies efforts and mistakes in iraq tuchman 's masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess regardless of individual political leanings that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable who knows there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled the march continues the horsema
when my sunday school teacher gave us the challenge of reading through the bible in a year i thought it was going to be hard so i started looking for a bible when i came across this one i was really excited it is by far my favorite traslation because it is so easy to read i can get through the daily reading in about minutes it breaks down the hard to read old testament into easy reading and one of the best parts is that it breaks down the reading by day so you are not constantly going back and forth between the books truely one of the best bibles i have purchased ! ! !
many stories in this book reminds me of the famous essay silent spring '' the writing style is extremely accessible to every body and yet delivers a significant amount of knowledge advice and sometimes wisdom the author carefully explains medical terms and implications thus easing the reader 's mind without using a medical book this book is highly recommended to anyone who has a curious mind
kate white introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel over her dead body i could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the buzz and its rag competitors in production while the mention of 'current ' celebrities will date this book kate 's spellbinding storytelling definitely has staying power over her dead body is a novel about the murder of the mona hodges editor in chief of the buzz who had a long list of hostages in her wake each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill a sprinkling of romance for levity even though the main character bailey weggins a celebrity crime writer gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion right to the end kate white keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime i am looking forward to reading more bailey weggins ' mysteries do n't keep us waiting kate ! armchair interviews says sounds like another good summer read
as a health writer i know that pharmaceuticals can be very dangerous compounds but for years i overlooked the fact that drugs are n't good for pets either your cat can probably benefit from safer alternative treatments martin zucker has put together a wonderful book with top veterinarians do n't keep alternative and holistic treatments to yourself share them with your pet
i loved this book ! i read it in a single day i have read everything else of maupin 's and strongly recommend this novel too this is probably my favorite book of his the author had more lyrical descriptions in this book than i remember from his past volumes i found myself rereading lines and paragraphs simply for the sheer beauty of language the falling apart relationship between gabriel and jess also hit me as realistic and at times almost too painful to read a great book ! ! !
'the regulators ' is not quite on the literary level of 'desperation ' but that makes it more fun in a way especially as it 's less preachy i liked that 'the regulators ' adds a little more information about the mysterious tak here we see a more terribly playful oddly fastidious and possibly younger tak who loves spaghetti chocolate milk westerns and cassie stiles and while most of the characters of 'the regulators ' are flatter than those of 'desperation ' 'the regulators ' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of desperation might have been like before tak possessed them particularly audrey and collie who were never shown '' in 'desperation
a looming high school reunion has led me to ponder the past especially the town i grew up in i have been reading the geography of nowhere by james howard kuntsler a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in america kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy le corbusier gropius bauhaus although kunstler 's book is by no means a complete history his insights are provocative his basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless geography of nowhere '' in other words since the americans have pursued a vision when it comes to urban development namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold with little regard to aesthetics growing up in a suburb i experienced this sort of of what a city should be or what it should do for its residents there was always nothing to do nowhere to go fortunately in those days creative people created their own scene '' no matter how lame it was such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance of course conformity was the rule and we all nearly s t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car it was almost like and 's first trip to disneyland it was like that first sexual experience it was an epiphany of sorts little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls who ever thought that being so cheap would cost us so much
very few books can weave the historical narrative with an account of the subject as does it in this more he does total justice to the subject by making sure persons who should get their credit does atleast so the author 's canvas is huge and he almost reminded me of how much i missed undergraduate math a must read for students of algebra as this one sets a context which is far brilliant than the dry subject textbook i myself taught a class in algebra aat university of new orleans
extremely well researched mcchesney has been a key figure in the media debate '' and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity his disciplined almost scientific investigation is an example of coverage of a crucial issue if only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as mcchesney we would be in a better world i am a mexican citizen so i could n't care less about partisan politics and if you care about the fate of public communications you should n't either this is a problem that affects every country not just the since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the world the interest of big advertisers is being protected by policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere even the smallest community in the jungles knows ronald mcdonald cnn has latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most latin countries as an outsider i hope the citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of democrats republicans but a issue of the individual the big corporations in reality they do n't care about your political affiliations as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products you can debate each other to death
woodward and bernstein famous reporters for the washington post during the watergate scandal chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of president nixon and his cronies during watergate this book takes the reader through woodward and bernstein 's efforts at uncovering the truth internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering and covert meetings with confidential sources they tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world 's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the us presidency was respected above all else this book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was instead of printing first and asking questions later woodward and bernstein along with their editors took painstaking efforts at checking double checking and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print it seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now ask questions later and file a retraction in small print even later this book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt presidency it gets better with each reading
a lot of the reviews i have read here both positive and negative have noted smith 's acerbic and sometimes hostile tone in my own discussions on god particularly when engaging christians i probably would not use some of the more harsh language found in the book it tends to be devisive and unproductive and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to atheists that does not mean that any of smith 's arguments are not legitimate or powerful they should be confronted by anyone who takes any position regarding religion or god perhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the chapter discussing the purported proofs '' for the existence of good posited by christian thealogians and laymen smith explains that many times in the past before knowing better i would engage in arguments with theists who claimed to have a rational foundation for their belief after several painstaking hours of pointing out flaws in the proposed arguments i would receive some form of the following comment 'well it really does n't matter if these proofs are invalid because i have faith in the exstence of god anyway ' the theist who resorts to this approach has no claim to only lack of integrity '' smith 's frustration throughout the text at this type of intrangisence is palpable and ultimately entirely understandable some of the reviews on this page are illustrative of the general resentment which most christians seemed to hold for the methods by which human beings acquire knowledge and distinguish truth from falsehood as an outspoken atheist i have heard these types of decrees repeated to me ad and they never stop being disturbing lean not on your own understanding '' i have been told again and again trust in the lord and stop using all this silly logic '' or god wants us to believe like children '' they will say all i hear is i am happy being ignorant you will be happy in this delusional fantasy land i live in too i know god is not just an inadequate answer to these questions but no answer at all things do n't need answers or explanations or anything everything is ok because i have faith in god '' hence i sympathize with smith 's frustration i urge all atheists to read this book which reads more or less like a conversation between an atheist and an extremely intellectual and sophisticad christian who spews practically every argument ever conjured to be a believer or to be a christian and has them overwhelmingly refuted smith understands the obstanince that atheists will inevitably encounter when christians particularly unsophisticated christians are challenged this is probably the reason why some of his repudiations seem unnecessarily expatiated any atheist who has offered apologetics in defense of atheism knows that trying to engage a christian is like playing as soon as one battle is definitvely won the christian will retreat into a sheild of ignorance this act smith accurately points out will usually involve the word faith '' being substituted for but meaning the exact same thing as ignorance '' i assume this is why smith so meticulously tears apart the idea of something that human beings call faith '' being an effective or even theoretically plausible conduit to fundamental truth he also points out the common ways that christians like william lane craig and moreland use mangled science or language to misrepresent the issues at hand as a small example of this that i found interesting in does god exist '' moreland states that he believes that people can actually perceive god through something he calls numinous perception '' moreland does not give an explanation of how an outside observer could ever deiscern whether someone was having a genuine numinous perceptive '' experience or how exactly numinous perception would actually work physiologically or psychologically conveniently this would rule out any chance of moreland 's hypothesis ever being tested and shown to be accurate or inaccurate when someone hears an argument like this one can easily turn to smith for excellent articulation of why they are absurd and illegitimate smith writes my argument with the christian is that he claims to have experienced god but he refuses to explain the process by which he a physical organism experienced this supernatural being i wo n't limit him arbitrarily to the traditional five senses but i will demand that he present evidence for his new perceptual powers has he discovered a new sense fine then let him tell us about it so we can test it no christian has ever succeeded in explaining just how he perceives his mysterious god he claims to have knowledge of a mysterious unknowable being having gained this knowledge in some mysterious unknowable manner this is totally unacceptable '' moreland 's clever creation of a scientific sounding title for perception of god does not help him this book will help atheists with this type of argumentation through just about any thread of thought a theological argument can get into yes the rhetoric 30 years later sounds more sophisticated with other clever titles like intelligent design theory '' but it is not actually more compelling or sophisticated than when aquinas wrote his five proofs or russell challenged copelston i reccomend this book and i ca n't wait to read why atheism '' just as a curious note does anyone know if smith actually debated people in public if anyone knows of any transcriptions id love to read some please let me know if you do
golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies especially in this novel and in the inheritors 1955 on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology the central symbol of the lord of the flies is that of a pig 's head upon a stick stuck in the ground a totem in the making perhaps but seen by golding as beelzebub the lord of the flies '' the devil a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies the central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition the will to power and the primordial need to survive when piggy 's glasses which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken it signals the degeneration the return to the wild in which as thomas hobbes has it there are no arts no letters no society and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death and the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short '' that a group of english school boys could degenerate so quickly after on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful or more exactly as the artifice of the artist nonetheless the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times should we through nuclear warfare a runaway greenhouse effect sectarian violence on a global scale or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization regress to the state of savages we have this warning instead of the noble savage instead of a return to the garden of eden instead of the swiss family robinson or robinson crusoe golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy 's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare as in the inheritors golding sees not the good in humans but the viciousness in the inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle neanderthal here we children become gangsters of the island on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the god of the old testament i understand that golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of ballantyne 's the coral island 1857 which i have n't read clearly cruelty is one of golding 's main themes left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization 's justice humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power the boys ralph and piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government but are defeated by the brutality of jack and his will to savagery the loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had but of something superimposed upon them by civilization in reality golding is saying there is no innocence in children that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe this is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to but the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys as in all great works of literature it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages and invites our admiration it should be noted that golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he did n't find the task palatable i am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel not only are there no girls on the island but the boys do not at least overtly involve themselves in sex we can see that golding 's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually i wonder if postmodern psychology would agree certainly freud would not bottom line a great read a terrific adventure but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens in other words you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares
a lot of these reviews say that they 've read this book and it 's done wonders '' for them and everyone they 've recommended it to the book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things gawain suggests it 's not a miracle book it 's about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you i read this book in college when i was going through a little bit of a rough patch figuring out what i wanted etc now that i 've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world i need more positivity in my life so i 'm it in the hopes that i can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again i highly recommend it to those who are enough to give it a chance
not only a terrific portrait of louis mayer but a wonderful history of hollywood my caveat is the portrait of dore schary while eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between mayer and thalberg eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the mayer schary conflict in the last part of the book possibly to correct '' the view of mayer the monster and schary the savior in earlier mayer bios his portrait of schary a man i knew bears no resemblance to that decent fair minded and gifted man it is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of schary eyman claims that schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals yet schary in his post mgm days produced a successful musical the unsinkable molly brown '' whatever good flims came from mgm during schary 's reign are dismissed as the work of others he creates a portrait of schary as a talentless hack forgetting not only the good films schary wrote in earlier days but the successful broadway play he wrote about fdr sunrise at campabello '' he writes that schary only spoke of himself in retirement i knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends if he can get schary so wrong it forces me to question his other judgments having said all that i think this is a fine book evoking old hollywood with grace and style
if you are planning a trip to italy this is a book you should take with you
wow i had to have this book they are right he explains everything wrong with oracle and all about vulnerabilities and exploits
as soon as people see breton 's name on a book they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim the dictator of surrealism ! '' what they do n't seem to realize is that despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body nadja '' is simply one more delightful proof of breton 's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal the mysterious the mystical and everything that is profoundly divergent in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja which is the russian word for hope the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her at the end of the novel nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton 's and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end it may be true that breton 's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate she died of cancer insane and completely alone is indeed nothing to admire but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity even while the second world war raged and reaped it 's devastating results universally on all of mankind to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence however 'absurd ' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism ' the philosophical justification of human misery at all costs can only call forth our admiration his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct concrete experience of life as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow our inner lives hopefully become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible do n't be fooled by the 'anti breton ' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him because you 'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books to my mind ever written
this is one of the most insightful books i 've ever come across the author is simply a genious embracing the principles of this book may be the difference between developing a successful business or not
i realize that this is the only book currently on the market for the 993 aside from spending a small fortune on the actual shop manuals on cd 's but after receiving the book and spending several nights giving it a good read i have come to the conclusion that someone will be hard pressed to put together anything so accurate and complete this is a must for any 993 owner !

this book offers such a fabulous collection of ideas the information and ideas one can gather from these pages is both a great way to trace the roots of feminism as well as to decide where we go from here each section and piece has introductory information giving a setting of time place and situation before the writers present their views there are so many ideas ideals and beliefs that while not always agreeable or congruent can be applied to today 's feminist movement there is virtually nothing in the book that is n't valuable as either an example of progress or the seed of a new branch for the feminist tree to understand the position in which women today navigate life this book is essential reading interesting entertaining and informative it ought to be required readin

nicholas nickleby is a significant dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses the protagonist 's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama comic relief political satire class comedy social criticism and domestic farce they allow dickens the opportunity to portray to the minutest nuance an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics the main frame of nicholas nickleby is a quintessential dickens a generic virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate nicholas nickleby has committed no fault and offenses and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world to be separated from the people he loves and to be proscribed like a criminal the more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life the more profusely the novel accentuates dickens ' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice when nicholas nickleby is left exiguous after his father 's death he turns to his uncle to solicit succor but ralph nickleby a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows the man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed it 's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains he cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred he might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in squeers ' dotheboys hall a school for unwanted boys as an assistant master the cruelty of squeers who 's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper nicholas has been an unwilling witness the filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling the thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation the cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in nicholas who interferes with the schoolmaster 's flogging a boy named smike and astonishes everyone in school not only does ralph persuade nicholas ' family to renounce him for the atrocities to squeers of which he is guilty he also betrays his niece kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual lecherous ribald and vulgar terms she is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity the mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as nicholas overhears conversations about his sister the hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled as the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous memorable and true to life peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire theatrical success courtship family farce and chicanery the most significant character is no doubt smike whom nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend nicholas ' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel 's hero whose domestic virtues affections compassion and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice nicholas nickleby is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch details on the yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty filthiness and despotism in the boarding schools nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as nicholas nickleby also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one 's remorse although ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do in a sense nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society he tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy but in the effort to undertake the good deeds he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes in the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle 's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him but ralph 's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat nourished on his interference with all his schemes nicholas nickleby is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues woven in one man 's aspiration to restore family 's ancestral dignity is dickens ' own musing monologues teachings on the soul the life and the moral the discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency sobriety and indignation

the reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded the conversations in the book are intelligent the characters and dialogue are real and the descriptions and settings are vivid while the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon yale and new haven it is sometimes hard to believe especially given that the author has been a faculty member at yale law school for over this is not to say however that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate rather they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university yale and those that are not in short i enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right this is not a thriller that grisham might come up with instead this is a much more intellectual read what i enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life careers law and racism in this country if you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters especially talcott believe me this book will reward you and you 'll be glad you read it
as a practicing physicist now just an physicist '' and lifetime music lover i have found this little book irresistible over the 17 years it has been in my library in 1983 when the original hardcover edition came out this book was given to me as a gift by someone knowing my musical tastes figuring that it would be the perfect gift it turned out to be but for reasons that are largely as an scientist i 've read and enjoyed more than a few popularizations by scientists over the years these include richard feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote i number myself among those physicists who cut their eye teeth '' on the feynman lectures in physics stephen hawking brian greene carl sagan and even brian swimme the swimme of a walk through time '' goes down easily and covers much of the same ground that thomas does but in a quite different way the swimme of the universe is a green dragon '' is a much harder sell for me due to its attempt to oversimplify but for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope and for essays that provoke thought on the part of the reader none can hold a candle to thomas everyone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her favorites here are a few of mine in things unflattened by science '' an essay on unaddressed incomplete challenges that future scientists might well undertake a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to better understand what music is and how it affects the human condition starting with a rather assignment to explain the effect of bach 's the art of fugue '' on the human mind in altruism '' an essay on the symbiotic interrelationships among species how it is that such a condition actually exists and a challenge to future scientists to better understand how our own species might become more altruistic and adult than it presently is in the attic of the brain '' a cautionary essay on the risks of psychiatry most importantly psychoanalysis in terms of performing total brain dumps '' the need for all of us to carry around a little clutter in our lives as insurance against the chance that we might inadvertently lose our ability to retrieve something truly important in the title and final essay another cautionary tale this time on thermonuclear weaponry the most lucid description i 've ever read regarding the true meaning of this music as envisioned by gustav mahler in a few brief but sublime paragraphs thomas has captured the essence of this remarkable opus in a way that no musician and that includes such mahlerites as bernstein karajan klemperer rattle and walter ever had until very recently that is with the release a few months back of a staggering performance by benjamin zander conductng the philharmonia orchestra but that is another topic and another review in the seventeen years since the initial publication of this book quite a bit has changed in our worldview in some aspects of society and science but not enough ! the observations and challenges that thomas lays out will endure for centuries provided only that we endure as well bob zeidle

the adventures of huckleberry finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published shortly after it was accessible to the public multiple committees banned the book proclaiming it to be racist and trash '' to this day mark twain 's adventures of huckleberry finn is banned in several school districts in my personal copy of the adventures of huckleberry finn there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by robert o'meally he clearly states that the intent of twain 's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book his usage of the racial slur nigger '' can be seen as offensive but i believe it was necessary for it to be realistic the dialogue that huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character time and place at which the slur was used casually besides the usage of the word nigger '' characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality in the begining of chapter 14 huck and jim are talking about all sorts of topics both of them speaking their mind twain describes huck 's thoughts well he was right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger '' obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude yet i believe that twain is simply describing the way huck thinks of jim the growing friendship between huck and jim is the basis of the entire novel the book depicts the way huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate i strongly support mark twain 's the adventures of huckleberry finn the book wins people over with it 's dialogue plot originality and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust america

i just got a book out of the library the author is a nut about recording songs and analyzing the sonograms frequency intensity over time and in his mind when he hears a song he identifies it by how it looks '' in his mental sonogram this whole idea is amazing and i think i 'll never listen to birds the same way again just after reading the first few pages ! the writing style pulls you into the author 's world as he tracks birds and ponders the meaning of their song if you love birding you will wish you had been there on every walk and you 'll want to wake up two hours before dawn the next day to discover the amazingly different songs of common birds the book comes with as cd with 98 tracks of songs and some of the tracks are slowed down which really changes your perception and shows you the depth and richness of some of those blurt '' sounds birds make the woodthrush at speed reminds me of a howling wolf i know i 'll never listed to this song the same way again

i 'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here but i would like to say that i do n't have much time for reading so make sure the books i choose are those by authors i consider robb nora roberts is one of the most prolific authors i 've ever read how she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination i 've read this series out of order but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone this one however revealed to me the reason behind eve 's sometimes belligerent attitude her strong persona and standoffishness robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts inner turmoils great book

i loved the four agreements by don miguel ruiz in which he shared wisdom from his toltec ancestors it helped me and i 'm sure countless others develop a simple yet effective code of personal conduct so when i had the chance to listen to his book the mastery of love i naturally was intrigued by the possibility of gaining some more valuable insights from the author this time dealing with the subject of both developing and maintaining a loving relationship perhaps my only disappointment in this title was that it was too short i gained so much from it that after one listening i immediately felt the need to go back and listen a second time methinks that if you were reading it you 'd do the same if just to master this one concept to try to change somebody is to try to change a dog or cat you love them for who they are if you 're with somebody do n't try to change him or her also there were these other valuable tidbits let go of the past and begin every day with a high level of love if you do n't love yourself you can change your belief and your life will change when you hear your heart guiding you to happiness make a choice and stick to it forgive others and you will see miracles happen in your life and lastly there was this one that really struck home if your choice is to be in a relationship and your partner is playing the same game what a gift !
simon winchester is a popular historian in the modern mold this means that he 's socially and politically a liberal and that he 's interested in connected with a specific event he 'll examine it from all angles and attempt to see it from everyone 's eyes look over everything connected with it and then draw some conclusions usually those conclusions some i 'm being general about this type of writer not of winchester specifically and the point of view is relentlessly modern winchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano krakatoa in 1883. interestingly the author is trained as a geologist though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer this means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman 's terms and the result is generally a happy one krakatoa was a complex event the island had three summits each a separate volcano two disappeared in the explosion but they erupted for a good while beforehand and their effects lasted for years afterwards and winchester does a good job of relating what happened the prelude to it and the aftermath the one criticism that people have which i agree with is that he tends to wander a bit at times there are discussions here of everything from dutch colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical though carefully explained geology while it 's all interesting sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic the author also occasionally a bit for instance his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to indonesia 's independance is a bit much my edition included a magazine article he 'd written just after the boxing day tsunami in which he attempts to connect the san francisco earthquake with george bush 's election as president that seems and even bigger stretch to be honest when the author sticks to the story however what he writes is very interesting i would recommend this book
this is truely a funny book it of course is the origin of the ma and pa kettle movies yet much more i like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle when you read it you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were although it is a good read on that level too seeing were our culture has been and where it is today i did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work good grief folks lighten the thing for what it funny story meant to amuse when i was a kid i did not read micky mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness nor social commentary although being a dog lover i was not always happy how pluto was presented and treated nor did i compair the micky of 1949 to the micky of 1952. anyway digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine i suppose if you are into such but for me i just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it
george dewolfe sees the photographer as an artist not a technician yet his book provides the technical knowledge and shows how to use photoshop to create consistently high quality fine art prints writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of photoshop dewolfe begins by showing the photographer with many examples how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities the experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light luminosity and color give life to an image and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them dewolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work after showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to it dewolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which once mastered allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis the workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing photoshop techniques and image adjustments those who think visually will find these particularly helpful dewolfe 's approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results some photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking as a photographer who uses this tool i appreciate its simplicity and controlled results his focus is not on in photoshop '' but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest most straightforward way while a first reading gives valuable insights the book 's true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images and practices to become proficient the proof as they say is in the print

well the name of this set does say it all fashion ! that 's the theme of this mix match stationery set i liked it a bit more than some of the other mix match stationery sets out there the paper quality is a teensy bit better with this set as the paper is slightly thicker the illustrations are very colorful and pretty it has drawings and he complements each with colors such as bright blue and fuchsia the drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of shoes or little kisses to a of a very face at the top of each sheet there are little quotes of andy 's relating to fashion very cool for maintaining the overall theme i think the different each have a flap that more or less complements one of the particular sheet designs but of course as the name suggests it 's all open to a little mix match finally there are quite a lot of stickers to decorate your mail as your will dictates they 're very pretty too including purses mannequins kisses and oh they 're the clear kind so they look a little bit more distinguished all in all a very good way to spruce up your everyday mail get it especially if you 're a fan of andy warhol or a fashionista

i liked this prep guide because it 's not one of those huge books that 's impossible to fit in your or laptop bag if you 're traveling it has enough information to pass the test which is good enough for me because that 's all i needed to pass the test this month but if you 're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right this is not the book for you the book does n't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam just enough to pass it the only draw back to this book is that it does n't come with a cd with a comprehensive set of sample test questions i had to go to one of those huge books that i bought a couple of years ago for that but i did n't read the huge book

citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man thorby as he matures from boy to man starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar baslim we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom though we see that in fact 'slaves ' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men ' the society he paints here is vivid and believable though the economics of slavery in a culture has always seemed a little dubious to me baslim is far more than he appears to be and puts thorby through a rigorous education both academic and practical how do you become a really good beggar here heinlein falls in with ayn rand whatever you do do it to the best of your ability from begging to juggling also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums these are items that may pass over young readers ' heads but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined nothing should be accepted on 'faith ' that personal integrity is more important than 'success ' that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action later baslim calls in some favors and sends thorby to live with the free traders a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture here thorby discovers another aspect of freedom a person 's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives the free trader society which owes much to margaret mead 's seminal ideas and highlighted by an anthropologist character named margaret mader heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security peace of mind and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice this section of the book may be the best part as the society is so different from today 's american culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right apart from its effects on thorby thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires the last section deals with thorby back on earth within a society not much different from our own and shows a third aspect of freedom the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity defining decisions as by external forces as this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a dominated one it is n't as engrossing as the first two sections but is highly important in terms of completing heinlein 's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom characterization other than thorby and baslim is pretty thin especially for the females that appear in supporting roles this was fairly typical for his juveniles as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character but the thematic line on is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works most especially farnham 's freehold has to be seen as one of heinlein 's personal beliefs unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate this book is not heinlein 's absolute best nor even the best of his 'juveniles ' which are typically better reading than most 'adult ' mainstream bestsellers but still provides an engrossing fun and illuminating read recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own reviewed by patrick shepherd hyperpat
written all the way back in the long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the us today this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient i feel like i would have had a much better understanding of this subject not to mention appreciation of the people involved had i discovered it a long time ago but i suppose late is better than never ted conover did what i do n't imagine very many other americans would have the courage to do cross illegally from mexico into the us with mexicans doing the same thing in doing so he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some mexicans to make that journey what life is like where they come from what the journey is like and what awaits them on this side of the border i found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born american and simply in awe of the mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north conover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved coyotes is a touching informative and inspiring book that should be required reading for all americans before they open their mouths about illegal immigration

many people remember the battle of midway as the turning point of the war in the pacific due to the sinking of four japanese aircraft carriers and rightly so but would the american success at midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons probably not in this account of the battle author alvin kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes cleared the way for the sbd dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the japanese carriers after sighting the enemy carriers the three american flattops began launching their torpedo bombers dive bombers and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the japanese fleet however while en route to the target almost all of the squadrons became separated and the uss hornet 's contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the japanese fleet its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea meanwhile the planes from uss yorktown and uss enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks thus the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection these planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from japanese fighters out of a compliment of 51 planes 44 were shot down one man ensign george gay survived from torpedo squadron 8. not a single american torpedo hit the japanese fleet however this sacrifice was not in vain for a few minutes later the sbds found the japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three japanese carriers to the bottom the fourth followed later in the day the author brings up some interesting points in the book for example he mentions the confusing flight plan of the hornet 's commander ring who for some reason chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the japanese fleet he then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the hornet the author also describes the inferiority of the american aircraft specifically there extremely limited range which in the end caused the american fighters to turn back also the fighters that did make it to the japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering devastators in all intents and purposes the sbds happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time if they had not the battle could have turned out much differently this is a fascinating book i 've read several books about the battle of midway but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does the writer a former member of the enterprise 's air group describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could he raises some alarming quetions which i had never thought about before reading this book although the book itself is somewhat short it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes i highly recommend this fine book if you 've read anything previously about the battle of midway you must read this book it sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the american torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the american victory

part geology part biography part history of scotland this excellent book is a tribute to james hutton the originator of modern geology starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth the author weaves the intriguing story of james hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth 's true antiquity the political situation in eighteenth century scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which hutton lived but the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after hutton 's death is also discussed ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them this is a very and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience

flip the switch is an excellent book i 'm 29 and tired of being overweight i bought this book months ago i read half of it then moved from seattle to valdez alaska all the while i was moving i could not stop thinking about this book as soon as my shipment arrived i found the book asap and finished it i have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books i look at it this way spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around 10.00 for a resistance rope plus you get to do this in the privacy of your home this is a great idea especially for women that have children a job and the home to contend with jim karas was overweight for several years he can relate to me he revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because i simply can not handle cardio workouts due to a bad back the running and stepping '' in cardio is too much for me this is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience

oh spike in san antonio it 's so hard to believe that sexism exists is n't it i 'm not sure where your numbers come from as your logic seems tenuous at best but according to that liberal think tank known as the us census bureau is right and it 's getting worse the census bureau reported in august based on the current population survey that women 's real median earnings fell by 171 or 0.6 percent from 2002 to 2003 while men 's increased by 336 or 0.8 percent the increase for men was not statistically significant but the decrease for women was the gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5 compared with 76.6 in 2002. in addition a government accountability office gao report released in october of 2003 controlling for changes in education and work experience over time concludes that womens earnings have remained stagnant relative to men 's for an even longer period 17 years with a gap that can not be explained by measurable differences in education and experience if you actually read the you might find cited cases like this although women make up nearly of 's workforce men hold 90 of management positions despite female employee 's receiving better performance evaluations overall and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs none of this is disputed by the corporation why according to because men are there for a career while women are working for pocket money i wish i could say your attitude was merely naive but the truth is it 's far more dangerous and insidious thanks to for telling it how it really is
having read most of grisham 's books i 've saved a few of his best '' for last while it was n't a 5 star book like i 'd hoped it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one having saw the movie years ago i had a good idea of what the book was about two supreme court justices are killed a law school student along with many other people become curious and try to figure out who dun it '' only she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head and when the wrong people find out she 's on the run for her life ! i enjoyed the book mostly because it was and had a lot of detail so much detail and characters i had a bit of a struggle to keep up ! of course it was suspenseful and the characters especially of darby the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth good read
kenneth pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of iran from the rise of the persian empire to the reign of the pahlavis pp pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic iran got wary of meddling foreigners starting with the hated russians and brits in its domestic affairs pp 4 41 many iranians have angry psychological scars believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons pp 26 71 89 99 125 128 161 242 297 389 pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled

mosaddeq 's crime '' was the illegal '' nationalization of the iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious brits pp the did not improve its reputation among most iranians by supporting the dictatorial shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of iran until his overthrow in 1979 pp xxv pollack convincingly demonstrates that the truman administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the shah to democratize and liberalize iran when they had the opportunity to do it pp 49 81 104 the shah who was ironically considered sold out to the west became less and less amenable to the omniscient '' beginning in the pp 39 50 84 94 107 158 173 after the revolution of 1979 the mostly supported saddam hussein during the war and funded different destabilization

presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective mohammad kathami who was under relentless pressure from the pp xxv pollack blames with equal conviction the iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the embassy staff in 1979 its lack of democratic credentials its support of terrorism around the world its opposition to the middle east peace process and its pursuit of nuclear wmds pp xxi 182 248 277 345 pollack also explains to its readers that many iranians have a poor understanding of the pp 50 180 309 pollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community including the at times from doing business with iran in the last years pp iran is trying without much success to emulate china by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development pp xxiv 250 the will be of no help in this endeavor as long as iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions pp 273 312 324 351 pollack tries to crack the iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of iran due to its size population and topography pp xxiii pollack ultimately pleads for a strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks pp the international community

with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the persian gulf but also in central asia pp energy prices will not go down in this scenario furthermore iranian could consider southern russia and chinese xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the treatment of many muslim minorities in these areas pp their military nuclear program is not purely defensive

lords of the earth '' is the term the yali warriors use to describe themselves they live in the heluk valley in irian jaya and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains the first section of the book is about them their customs and the awful fear and darkness they lived in don richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin and longing for release the horror of their pain is graphic and not suitable to be read to younger children the second part of the book describes the early life of stan dale his conversion and his burden for those in darkness he is drawn as a determined man physically strong and fit with firm convictions the book goes on to tell of stan 's coming to the yali people how a strange story begins over his identity protecting his life how the first few yali christians were killed and later stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered how another missionary family died in a plane crash except for the son whose friendship with the yali paves the way for them to turn to christ the book reminded me christ 's words in john verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit '' on earth stan dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth but he will rejoice in heaven with the yali that are there through his witness
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human the first time that i read it i read it as a novel for entertainment years later i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man during this second reading i was able to examine the russian names characters events and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog which i scanted then but studied now most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going which it certainly is but in it tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do in essence each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space with one atom colliding at random with another but when a sufficient number act in concert such as napoleon 's invasion of russia their force is irresistable when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms then they are drawing closer to a universal one '' with nature this one '' tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that one '' or any other deity but he does say that history time and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going
add this reviewer to the list of people who hold paradise lost up to the lofty title of the greatest epic poem in the english language it is not only this but one of the best in any language writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed homeric epic verse mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by homer virgil and dante but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work the opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by homer as are other elements but milton has a very unique poetic style long sentences often with the principle verb at the end being one of its mainstays this language is very grandiose and quite complex it takes a while to get used to it you will have to pay very close attention during the first book but as with most classical literature once the reader gets the hang of it it goes quite smoothly the divine comedy of dante has a more towring reputation than does milton 's paradise lost for one thing it is older but i among those who find milton to be superior the divine comedy is certainly an undisputed masterpiece but where it was more or less a satire and a attack on many of dante 's political enemies milton 's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter why mankind fell how the gods themselves operate and think the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin the importance of love in human relationships the moral problems of god 's justice it is true that dante 's work is more original paradise lost and paradise regained at least in seed come straight from the bible but milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective strictly within the christian tradition to be sure but far from fundamentalist and even quite radical for its day although some cite the work as christian apologist there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more christians would be taken aback by it was of course even more controversial in its day one thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than god this in my view does not have milton unwittingly on the devil 's side as some critics have suggested rather he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is of course it 's interesting of course it 's appealing otherwise we would n't keep falling for it again and again and again if we saw its fangs and dripping mouth we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago however as a myself i can not but disagree with some points of milton 's theodicy the last two books in particular and paradise regained as a whole were for me quite hard to swallow i found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing milton paints adam and eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share joy happiness fear sadness depression and most of all the overriding paramount importance of love the act of adam who was not himself evil eating of the apple so that he could follow eve no matter what doom was to befall her and them out of love for her is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature as mark twain in the voice of adam later said wheresoever eve was there there was eden '' god satan and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics most christians today seem to have forgotten that god created man in his own image '' and that he is not a perfect creature likewise satan is not entirely evil certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic but so are many humans indeed many have seen him as the hero of the poem an errorenous view as i see it god often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful indeed to many readers myself included this poem does n't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of gods to men but only reinforces the views we already had mark twain whom i have previously mentioned has a very different view of the situation closer to my own perspective that is worth seeking out whatever one 's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem the poem remains a great work of literature poetic grandiose profound extremely readable and the shorter sequel paradise regained is also included in this edition this work in my view comes nowhere near the glory of it 's predecessor but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well for that reason i highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works also because the introduction written by susanne woods is very good and it has notes provided by the wonderful christoper ricks who also edited the poem for this version unlike many editors he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them this is an absolute classic not only of english literature but of world literature and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read
for someone totally unfamiliar with authorware i thought this book rather confusing i typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises however i knew authorware was pretty complex so i thought this book would help well it did help a little but overall i became quite frustrated with following the book 's exercises as i use authorware i imagine i 'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool but until then i 'll content myself with playing on my own

harvey is a totally spoiled boy it starts when harvey is on a ship with his mother i forget where they are going he is washed overboard and saved by a fisherman ' on the fishing boat harvey makes his first friend learns to work for his keep and so on the story worked it was n't cheesy maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type but the plot of harvey growing up '' seemed just to be there so you will read the book the characters were well developed except the cook you never really figure out where he is coming from most of the book was about fishing of the grand banks very interesting is you like fishing and ships but if you are reading it for the story there is not that much the ending was also weak we are happy the harvey is reconciled but i really think that his parents would make a bigger stink good historical value kipling is a very enjoyable writer yes i liked it but the plot had some flaws i do recommend it though
i loaned my copy of streicher 's book to my mother who thought she may need a hysterectomy my mother reported that streicher 's book had information on topics she could n't find elsewhere even about laparoscopic procedures which she had n't heard about before streicher 's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor fortunately it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy my only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother i may need to purchase a new one i think it is a '' for any woman even for men whose are facing this
i was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and i found it surprisingly helpful by filling out a basic personality inventory this book will tell you what style '' of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other styles '' i see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday but i can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment if you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior this book gives you the skills to build great relationships i agree however with the previous reviewer 's comments that this book does not go very deep thus only 4 stars do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this but you can make your dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics this is also an easy read took me 2 days !
this book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago i own and have read about twelve books on the topic out of all of them this has been by far the best by the end it feels like a journey inside yourself has taken place and you arrive to a new destination on your insides the feel of the book is one of love and support not the type or author as guru type that i have read in other books this one has the experience of two professional therapists that shows itself in each chapter it made a large difference in my struggle with an eating disorder that started at age 10. i am now 44
classic book is great in format with good reproductions of the original illustrations lots of squirming and hugging while reading this one
tapscott and ticoll have written another very detailed practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely at the heart of the naked corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge in other words perhaps the old adage there 's one born every minute '' needs updating they 're still being born but hopefully now only a few per hour corporations getting naked '' ca n't be good news for marketing departments their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image companies and products must be the image for real yikes david brett founder knexa

whitman is not the world 's greatest poet that 's probably shakespeare but he 's certainly been the most influential american poetic voice over the past century he was the first poet to take all of american life as his subject ever the romantic whitman was also the first poet to bring romanticism into line with everyday reality his narcissism can be annoying but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power some of his short poems a noiseless patient spider '' and to a locomotive in winter '' are individually memorable the longer poem when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed '' indirectly about the lincoln assassination is brilliant i think most of his civil war poems are overpraised but come up from the fields father '' is a masterpiece of its kind on the negative side whitman 's transcendental philosophy which he likes to indulge at length will strike many readers as very sappy his style lots of details piled up on top of one another grows monotonous and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship can not just be brushed off my advice is to not to try to get through it all at once the poems rarely become difficult '' they just tend to blur one into the other which may actually have been whitman 's intention overall there 's never been a book quite like leaves of grass '' in any edition and that 's why it keeps selling as a true classic in other words a very old book that people still buy and read and enjoy even when no teacher is telling them to reading it will get you as close as one book can to actually living in america with all its follies inequities and promise

os guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply this book is no exception the fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section one of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays all around the central theme of the importance of character while our culture often acts to create an end justifies the means '' behavioral set never before has character been so important or so difficult to really practice and live the book begins with some essays from famous leaders from plato to george washington winston churchill to machiavelli and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character and how it was to be demonstrated much of the material is pretty well known yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort my favorite sections were on the cultural erosions of character '' in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all from advertising to media the pressure to conform is greater than ever but in some ways has always existed one of the best essay 's in my opinion is called the revenge of failure '' wherein henry fairlie rips the legend of our times '' as envy at its worst no longer content to envy what others have and we do not we now attempt to destroy in others that which we can not achieve ourselves this process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to buy '' our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable thus character becomes something that is no longer earned '' the sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character in this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection the hunter becomes the hunted and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance are depicted with a convicting clarity overall this is a very well done and thought provoking book as a study guide it would be ideal for small groups or even personal reflections the book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness highly recommended
this book brings some of the items one read about in history classes to a more 'back channel ' perspective monroe doctrine and the like are the opening situations and instead of 'we put a blockade on german ship ' it goes it to some of the things that happened to stop a war from breaking out
i grew up reading and rereading this book as did all the five children in my family it 's one of the very funniest books i know on the subject of families and their foibles shirley jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when i recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor once you read this you must also read raising demons which is the sequel and every bit as good although much harder to find

for most of us the area of thanatology is something quite new despite the fact that death is such an intimate companion '' that can come at any moment of our lives whether by degrees or instantaneously irrelevant of our ethnic social and economic backgrounds it is a plain truth that can not be avoided and no technological advancements can make it go away i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you despite what your feelings may be and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier the adult must equally do so with death not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means the total cessation of physical life for if one denys its existence and its inevitability the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental spiritual and religious grief as well submission to and acceptance of the truth no matter how difficult it would be to hear could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing in elizabeth 's classic study of the dying process she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all hence how do you take the sting from the wound in on death and dying you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say to let them vent and at their own pace go through the classic defined stages of the dying process denial and isolation anger bargaining depression and acceptance the patients become our teachers we learn of their fears their possible financial burdens in one woman 's case the fear of the worms et cetera but we also learn about what the families go through their own anger and disbelief and guilt it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger other times not the united states is one of the most countries out there a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process for going foward means only one thing death ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe death has issues for everybody doctors people even ross heself it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together
i enjoyed robert webber 's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well at a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the fate '' of the church in america so much commodification '' has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be ecclesia '' although i agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church the lutheran synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy the church body which webber received his doctorate from my question is are we truly called to change '' the church in order to meet the people where they are at i agree with his assessments yet i question the reasonings behind doing it do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others just because the culture would be more prone '' to come to the church or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture our culture always asks the question what does this mean for me and this has been a active question in the church for sometime i believe the question that we should be asking is how does god give meaning to me or what do i mean to god our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the lord of the cosmos
i find it difficult to rate and review parenting books with such specific agendas such as the continuum concept i fear that alone this book would render a nervous new mother terrified of failure ! i am wary of books that pretend there is only one way to raise every child that said i adore text that encourages instinctual intuitive parenting coupled with the dozens of other parenting guides i have read from all spectrums the continuum concept is a very valuable book

for those who love historical texts but sometimes have a hard time weeding thru the period language overly technical jargon and miles of microfiche this book is a real blessing the author not only deals with the methods of tracking chasing and boarding prey but goes happily about the people who follow the sweet trade '' he covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea the events leading up to their rise in influence in the caribbean and goes into clothing food religion heirarchy weapons flags choice of ships and cultural relationships i picked up this book primarily to confirm or disprove my theories on individual weapons combat during boarding actions and while the techniques are not played up in any great detail citing the use of powder and grenades over cutlass and knife the reasonings behind what weapons were used and how unorthodox hand to hand combat could be in closed quarters are sound overall a very enjoyable and informative book ! gareth thomas director historical maritime combat associatio
with the hype over the da vinci code and its related popularity you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with dan brown of course this is not the case as brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers probably the biggest in the bunch was robert ludlum but not to be forgotten is jon land not quite the big name that ludlum or brown land is nonetheless the most pure fun with outlandish plots and tons of action the last prophecy brings back danielle barnea an cop and ben kamal a former palestinian detective despite the obvious conflicts caused by their different backgrounds the two are faithful lovers and as the novel begins both working as investigators for the in this case the two are called to look into a mass murder in a palestinian village at first it appears to be a massacre by israeli troops but it soon enough appears to be something far more sinister a conspiracy tied to events uncovered at the world war ii and some lost prophecies of nostradamus the last of these prophecies provides the key to the conspiracy land uses his standard formula for his novels the two split up for the majority of the book to separately unearth parts of the plot only to converge at the end to stop the bad guys typically the people who provide the information are assassinated by the villains before they can reveal all this formula works well enough since land executes it well and really brown and ludlum use a similar formula themselves i wo n't say this is perfect writing but it 's plenty good enough to merit a strong four stars my biggest problem '' with land is that he is only writing books featuring barnea and kamal i miss his older novels with blaine mccracken which were even more delightfully outlandish with their james world conquest plots but in the absence of mccracken this series still fits the bill for what land does best entertain from beginning to end
i made 4 dishes from the book for my girlfriends and all of the recipes were a huge hit the carmelized onion and spinach dip was amazing as well as the tomato and ginger soup i especially like the 'buy and arrange ' features which give you clever stylish ideas for easy dishes to throw together if you do n't have alot of time no more 3 course meals for me i 'm going all appetizers
note to reviewers the title of the book was a play on hillary claiming that there was a vast right wing conspiracy '' against her husband in the monica scandal she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything this is an excellent book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat bush i watched from canada and monthly visits to the us business and the book accurately reflects what was going on rightly or wrongly at the time it describes how a loose linkage of the media hollywood pop stars soros academia kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down bush and the gop it is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture perhaps the book can be faulted hence only 4 stars because there certainly was strident activity on the right too limbaugh hannity and o'reilly of course doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and hollywood behind them for me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of bush recall many hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to canada if bush was elected i 'm editorializing here but it does seem strange that some reviewers notably one from the uk use this site as a platform for gross remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question
devoted entirely to coming to amazon to trash conservative books i see the same names here i saw for kate o'bierne 's book tony blankley 's book michelle malkin 's books david limbaugh 's books you get the idea and most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing too you 'd think some of you would aim for creativity especially when you 're accusing republicans of being mindless automatons that said york 's research is impeccable and anyone who paid attention to the last presidential election knows exactly how hard george soros hollywood et al worked to push kerry through from cameron diaz 's teary if you want rape to be legal do n't vote '' lunacy on oprah to the dollars spent demonizing the swiftboat vets no one works harder than the left to silence dissenting opinion and hide the truth it 's because of books like this one conservative talk radio and fox news that conservatives finally have a voice in this country and the left has n't had to debate for so long they 've forgotten how to anyone looking for truthful incisive commentary on how far the left has gone to demonize and destroy bush how much time money and effort they 've wasted to obstruct him at every turn regardless of whether the policy in question would benefit the country this is an excellent book if you 're a leftist automaton that opposes everything purely on unquestioning ideological grounds well i guess i 'll be seeing your reviews on the next conservative bestseller wo n't i

since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story huge lawsuit against a hospital suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor i 'll simply leave a brief comment although the story is n't all that complicated it was still a quick enjoyable read and the ending was one i did n't see coming please be aware though that the horseman is not an alex cross novel which seemed to be one reviewer 's complaint this is the story of lindsay boxer sfpd lieutenant and her fellow women 's murder club friends i found the story to be heartfelt and emotional full of and as i said a very quick satisfying read

rabbi harold kushner is one of the best known authors of our time having written the classic book when bad things happen to good people this his ninth book was one of the top ten best selling religious books of the past year as the title indicates it is a study of psalm 23 certainly the most beloved of all of the psalms kushner writes with a pastor 's heart and a special eye toward the healing wisdom to be found in that portion of god 's word if you are looking for a book about putting your spiritual life into meaningful practice you might wish to read this book it is filled with inspiration and encouragement for an ongoing trusting relationship with god kushner takes each phrase of the psalm as his chapter headings and verse by verse provides insight and practical suggestions for how to make these truths come alive each day throughout the book kushner utilizes his vast knowledge of the original hebrew text to help the reader understand the nuances of the words such as soul '' and cup '' he explains the nuances of what the soul is and why the soul needs nourishing he states the world asks so much of us we give ourselves so totally to our work to the task of raising our family and running a home that we often forget to take time to nourish our souls '' page 61 the fact that god helps us feel safe in an unsafe world '' page 50 is the psalmist 's theme repeated and emphasized in every line drawing from the world of science and literature art and great works of theology this deceptively small book is filled with encouragement and blessing occasionally christians forgo reading jewish authors forgetting that judaism is the forerunner of our own faith in jesus christ that would be a mistake for here we have a work that is sacred to both of our traditions presented by an acclaimed author dedicated scholar and proven congregational leader kushner is rabbi laureate of temple israel in natick massachusetts he has been honored by the christophers as one of fifty people who have made the world a better place and by religion in american life as their clergyman of the year in 1999. this is a book to read give and savor over time if you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture as well as religion and fiction
i have long been aware of the commercial success of author nora roberts but the storylines and writing style a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance have never tempted me to read any of her work however i happened to pick up a copy of volume 21 depending on how you count anthology inclusions in the in death series written under the pen name robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series the year is 2058 with a strong central character detective lieutenant eve dallas who had a continuing romantic interest the mysterious irish billionaire roarke i have long enjoyed the spenser series by robert parker and the ensemble cast of ed mcbain 's precinct novels the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of new york city an area very familiar to me i was immediately hooked by survivor in death and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review i read origin in death the next book in the series as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well as with other series which i have enjoyed i then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved in my opinion the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer robb my recent three star review of naked in death the initial book in the series discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt so i will not go into detail again here and in summary i found this book a much better police procedural although with the major flaw that it seemed a little too obvious that eve 's pursuit of her initial suspect although logical would turn out to be a diversion from her identification of the real killer i so greatly enjoyed susan ericksen 's audio rendition unabridged cd of that book that i also chose to listen to the audio version of this novel i highly recommend her narration as likely to add to your enjoyment of the story a wonderfully apt dryden quotation concerning fame and death opens this story then eve dallas is discovered at the scene of a shocking homicide prosecuting attorney cicely towers a powerful and widely recognized star in the district attorney 's office and a woman with whom eve has dealt on occasion has been found with her throat brutally slashed in a nasty neighborhood far from her office and her home late one night the final appointment in her datebook is for an earlier dinner with her good friend and long time lover george hammett eve quickly establishes that she arrived safely home and subsequently received a mystery call of which she made no record but which obviously drew her to the scene of her death eve 's investigation is complicated by the close friendship of cicely 's marco angelini and their adult children david and marina with her boss commander whitney and his increasing concern as eve 's investigation concentrates on the family eve discovers that both david angelini and marina 's fiance randall slade have financial problems which could provide a motive for murder as additional damaging background information surfaces she appears to be on a collision course with whitney 's understandable concern both for these children who have suffered the tragic loss of their mother in addition the stress increases when it appears that the friendship whitney 's wife with the family may lead to her potential involvement as a material witness finally a further complication which brings into question dallas ' objectivity is the revelation that the angelini family cicely towers and eve 's lover roarke are are partners in a business venture additional murders soon occur which bear the signature trademark of the killer and media pressure intensifies on eve given the visible lack of progress in her investigation and the antipathy which she has evoked in morse who coanchors the evening news with her friend nadine furst eve is infuriated by 's actions and yet knows that in fact the only effective way to silence the slimeball 's continual attempts to denigrate her investigatory skills during his broadcasts is identify and catch the murderer meanwhile eve is also involved in establishing the boundaries in her relationship with roarke both with regard to their personal lives and when his aid might be appropriate in her police investigation after several twists including one diversion which i had not anticipated the story suddenly rockets towards a violent climax which it is not clear that all the central characters will survive in addition to roarke commander whitney dallas and reporter nadine furst this story contains all the series characters introduced in the first volume including mira and the unique irrepressible mavis freestone and summerset all of whom play relatively minor roles in this narrative finally the reader is introduced to patrol wo man peabody whose observational skills in her relatively minor role in this case commend her to eve she will eventually become both eve 's good friend and partner on subsequent cases and their complementary styles and skills will combine with their dedication to speaking for the dead and their loved ones will serve them well if you plan to read several volumes of the series i strongly suggest that you start with naked in death and then read this book even though they are inferior to the two later books which i have read the later books include details concerning the mysteries of roarke 's and dallas ' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that i would have preferred to have gradually unfold as i completed the series in the sequence which the author intended and certainly if you want a story then read nasked in death while this book still had some steamy sequences much more typical of nora robert 's novels than the later stories in this sequence they were much more infrequent and better integrated into the story however if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series then i strongly suggest that you skip the early books and concentrate on some of the later novels including either of the two which i mention at the beginning of this review the characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex meanwhile i plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of dallas ' past cases tucker anderse
this is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself this makes it a largely indispensable supplement handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism this is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear the reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as renan max weber and stalin although the views of marx and engels themselves or lord acton and friedrich meinecke would have been welcome additions and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars gellner anderson connor smith the texts are and organized and it really contributes to making a very complex subject and a daunting field of scholarship seem a little easier to grasp
if you are just starting out on photography i highly recommend this book it begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making ! for this reason alone i would give it 5 stars here in the first chapter the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures the photographer not the equipment they then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures at least the rest of us turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and cameras if you read nothing else but the first chapter alone i would bet that your photography will already begin to improve or if not the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself in fact even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital the next chapters give details about camera operations how to creatively use camera controls and another great topic how to tackle different photographic subjects just what i needed ! i like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white although i 'll probably not dive into it this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography other good stuff inside 1. projects at the end of most every chapter i dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture ! 2. information on digital aspect of photography although i shoot film slr i know that one day i 'll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice 3. all the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs ! in keeping with the beginner 's purpose this is intentional on the part of the authors if you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers you wont find it here but the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught 4. modest studio lighting you can create yourself ! the principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me the diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point however i am tempted to give this book 4 stars since i felt that despite it 's generous information attractive layout highly readable text and wide pages the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems the use of grey cards spotmeters and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained on the other hand they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems so i give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here now that you are aware of it you will probably do more research on it meanwhile a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone i therefore highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography

this story set early in the known space '' period is an important part of larry niven 's future universe full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science the protectors do n't fit quite comfortably into the known space '' universe and have raised some problems later for example in the famous wars '' where the known space '' universe has been shared by other writers including poul anderson jerry pournelle sm stirling and hal colebatch but the story is fine space opera and entertainment and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary sf
i picked up this book looking at the cover trying to figure out his picture i then looked at the titleee and it clicked i read this for school and it was n't hard to finish it because it amazed me with what everything really was usually i read fiction books that have diseases or disorders in them i figured that there should be some explaination for me it wasnt hard to follow also everything was explained very well i did n't have any real background other than the fictions books that you really could n't go by
after viewing the german artistic for television many years ago i decided to read this german family story to rival galsworthy 's forsythe saga i was not disappointed because this book deals among others with one essential aspect of human existence man 's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status the story of the buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who although belong to the same family can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality in this family we see characters who are able to adapt understand the world and compromise while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and this fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings it is for this reason that buddenbrooks '' is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil
alan lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities as a result he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science especially physics none of the essays are ultra profound but they 're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited this book reminds me of feynman 's rainbow '' by leonard mlodinow which i also found to be very enjoyable and like mlodinow 's book lightman 's book is a quick read as other reviewers have noted the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography biography the relationship between math and physics the nature and experience of scientific inquiry and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life as indicated in my title if you have at least a familiarity with modern physics and can also appreciate the humanities i predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable and perhaps also somewhat enlightening i enjoyed reading the book and i expect that i will read it again in the future
it may sound as though i am damning this book with faint praise but i believe that with a subject as complicated as feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener written in clear language buruma and margalit have written a essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the new york review of books the point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired i notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book there is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself can not achieve you will find that most reviewers myself included had a list of things that we missed in their overview these omissions felt serious to me but i notice that the lists have very little in common it is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try if you already have an adament point of view in this discussion then this book may well irritate you buruma and margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible given their own cultural bias if however you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience since reading it i lent the book to a good friend sorry publishers ! and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised quite an accomplishment in my opinion for a short history
okay the title is a bit much but i enjoyed this book tremendously some of the criticisms point to the elements i liked best the routine cases how they were approached and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what i 've seen on cops '' constant action and crisis ! there was a new story on every page and i wound up reading until 1 on a work day because i just could n't help reading one more page '' the descriptions of the surroundings the characters the sounds and smells of the settings conjured up a real sense of being there i was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book as atkinson tried to remain true to mccain 's philosophy that most people are n't entirely good or bad as a resident of the area i finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when i was growing up i remember the old boston record american newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front i highly recommend this book to anyone who lives in the northeast and to others who 'd like a glimpse into how boston politics are practiced in every profession

disarming iraq '' is hans blix 's and memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the invasion of iraq during which he tried to paint a clear picture for the un and the world of his inspection team 's findings claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy the polarized atmosphere was palpably tense while the the uk and spain insisted that iraq was not responding to inspections france germany and russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored parting the raging waters for a few weeks anyway was the quintessential diplomat hans blix as it reads he was too diplomatic unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive un policy it didn t help that he had a few doubts of his own that in spite of not finding any smoking guns '' in terms of banned weapons he still sensed that iraq was playing a game either the regime 's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the un or it was hiding something either way blix 's hesitation was enough to set the stage for colin powell 's historic february 5 2003 presentation of evidence of wmd s in iraq which was more or less the proverbial point of no return apparently what blix was trying to tell us before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media is now common knowledge about wmd s in iraq blix 's commission failed to find anything not because the iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons moving them ahead of inspections but because the weapons really weren t there iraq had disarmed at the end of the gulf war in 1991 just as they d claimed the un inspection program had worked without knowing it so how did the war move forward under false pretenses according to blix a deficit of critical thinking '' was to blame he speculates that our congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror even though blix himself wishes for a un resolution against brutal dictatorships the bush administration had to justify war in iraq by linking it to terror and since there was no real link it had to capitalize on the theoretical '' link of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction this is as far as his speculation goes where the phrase military industrial complex '' would seem most natural and expected followed by a salacious about bush cheney and nefarious links to saudi oil blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of america 's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance giving blix the benefit of the doubt perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational needless to say david kelly 's death the british scientist who leaked to the bbc that the british government had sexed up '' a document alleging iraq 's nuclear capabilities was an unfortunate suicide '' and not the work of a shadow government the entire document by the way turned out to be a forgery at least blix observed the horse trading '' intense economic and diplomatic pressures '' our government used to obtain votes from other countries votes needed to pass the un resolution authorizing the use of force as well as he disapproved the bush administration s spying on un delegations while on their diplomatic visits to new york blix had other objections to efforts but they are all based on facts and evidence and are in defense of iaea a previous inspection organization also headed by blix and unmovic the un 's monitoring verification and inspection commission interestingly the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a cluster '' document released by blix in early march of 2003 which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months unfortunately for france and germany american and british members of unmovic leaked draft copies of the document in other words france and germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their british and american counterparts their positions in favor of renewed inspections were not as compelling while blix s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs one can easily see why it was so difficult for americans to take blix seriously he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect even so he is gifted with an even temperament a good sense of humor and a sense of integrity all important qualities for diplomacy although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the un and iraq in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match blix s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience

michael farquhar has created another bathroom book for the set this one treasury of deception is just what it 's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes such as the blood libel it is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once the book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and amazingly enough never veers into the truly silly which is a blessing
this was an amazing book it was one of those where when you read it you can picture the story in your head almost movie like feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement this was my first fiest book but i can guarantee you it wont be my last the plot follows a young boy named kieli and his story of becoming a spy and weapon against those that murdered his village the story begins with kieli on a vision quest a test to prove he is ready to be an adult he must go to a sacred hill and wait for a vision to appear to him he then finds that his village has been attacked and that he is the sole remainer of his people the story goes on to tell of his quest for vengance and his plot of revenge amazing in every way
i think nora roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms as we 've seen in her books irish thoroughbred irish rebel and now true betrayals which was written in 1996. unlike the other two true betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres to me it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours kelsey byden was led to believe that her mother naomi chadwick had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she 'd come visit her she was an emotional wreck it seems the real reason her mother was n't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover talk about shock value ! kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made kelsey question everything in her life naomi has a working horse farm in virginia and kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life sounds like a typical plot line right well sort of but if nora roberts is writing it you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way like kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to kelsey 's broken heart can kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years will kelsey ever believe in herself again i wo n't give away any of the plot you 'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself ! i do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that i enjoyed the most sure there 's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the relationship but what i enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch the surrounding areas actual workings of the ranch etc nora roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and i found myself slipping off to virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book the lush green landscape the openness of the working ranch the racetrack ah it sounded like pure heaven the plot is very predictable everyone lives mother and daughter are reunited true love waits for kelsey etc what makes the story enjoyable is the mix that roberts has perfected not just pure romance but a little mystery and intrigue also
mind 's eye is the second 'eye of the beholder ' collection which began as the first comic strip to run in the new york times and provides a fine set of black and white strips which presents a particular viewpoint these visual puzzles provide much food for thought there are panels of scenes then turn the page for the unifying concept linking them
here 's a book that would have made a great spreadsheet there 's a lot of data here displayed via a string of pictographs text in this book serves to provide directions only i would have rated this higher if it provided a little background on the location the history geographic features etc
this book is the right choice for beginers and advanced users of spring it covers all major aspects supported by the framework and goes beyond than a 24 hours learning '' book emphasizes the basic theory and shows how to correctly use the framework in applications
with respect to my qualifications i am the founder of the learning spanish like crazy method i am also the author of several articles written on the topic of learning spanish and now for my review i tend to judge a dictionary by the following criteria 1. does it provide century spanish vocabulary words or only outdated spanish vocabulary 2. does it provide both the words that are commonly used in latin america and spain or only one or the other using yardstick number one this book did fairly well i found words such as raton '' not only defined as mouse '' as in the rodent but also mouse '' as in computer mouse '' and pantalla '' was n't only defined as a screen '' but a a 'computer monitor ' as well however it only used the original definition of bajar '' to lower to descend or to go down it lacked the century definition which is to download '' using yardstick number two this dictionary did well for the english word block '' i found the latin american definition of cuadra '' but i also found the european definition of the word which is manzana '' several dictionaries that i have used in the past only define the spanish word manzana '' as the english word apple '' and only define the english word block '' as the spanish word cuadra '' it is important that a dictionary provides both the latin american and european spanish words from my experience latin americans tend to use different vocabulary words from one country to another but if you use the european spanish word even though they may not use the word they will be familiar with it and will understand you overall i give this dictionary cuatro estrellas '' four stars
i just finished reading this book and loved it it helps put things into perspective i would recommend it to anyone who is going through trials in their life it 's on my all time favorite books list i just bought a copy for my and am encouraging many of my friends to read it
i ca n't go on enough about this book it should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government wall street and industry ceos the writing is excellent many of its passages read like prayers i ca n't think of topics and subjects more important than those jensen writes about our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas but instead of ruining it i think the trajectory of his book actually enhances his message the first half of the book where he discusses problems can be and difficult to get through certain parts of it but please hold fast through the end it is worth it jensen 's eloquence and wisdom are best when he is also discussing answers or possibilities as it were
i stumbled upon matthew reilly 's novel in the new release section of my public library i had never heard of him before this being his first release in the united states but the synopsis on the inside of the dust jacket caught my attention so i decided to give the book a try most books coming out now have author blurbs of recommendation i take with a grain of salt most of these authors are paid for their reviews or they are personnal friends making it difficult to determine the sincerity of the review everything is promised to be a white knuckle thriller '' or my personal favorite a rollercoaster ride of excitement '' but the majority of the time the book does not live up to the hype this is definately not the case with ice station '' this book is action with a capital a ! how this book has not been optioned for film bewilders me because if it is done right it would be one of the best action films of the past twenty years the book alone left me exhausted for a quick intro without giving anything away because i hate spoilers a crisis emerges at an isolated antarctic research station a marine recon team is sent to investigate and all hell breaks loose this is not an exaggeration when the action begins in this book it does not let up every time i thought the book was going to have a down moment to give me the opportunity to eat or get some sleep i got cold cocked by a left hook the characters only pause in the book to reload now there will be nay sayers out there who will criticize that the book lacks any real substance maybe there could have been more characterization perhaps there is a fact or two off when utilizing military jargon or technology or maybe an event bends the laws of probability but all i can say is i do n't care i had fun with this book for the two days i read the book i had a blast this is not a contender for the pulitzer prize it is not going to pop up on oprah 's book club this is a summer action movie put to words and i dare you not to have fun i may have discovered matthew reilly in the library but now i purchase his books as soon as they are released in hardcover i know what to expect and he never disappoints
i have always been intrigued with the hells angels and this book answered many questions especially the history of the club i was impressed that the author lived with them for a year
i was recommended this book after having taken a body electric workshop a few weeks before from the first page i began to the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend how to connect how to communicate and how to intimately bond on a higher plane ! although some of the prose is repetitive it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from a definite must have '' book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally
once again jasper fforde has created a story that is brilliantly written perfectly blending english literature with wit the book continues the story of thursday next by creating a new conflict as well as making connections with the previous thursday next novels adding a deeper level to the reading highly recommended reading but i also recommend you read the series in order
with the release of jasper fforde 's fourth title in the thursday next series readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative earth that the author has spent three books building in something rotten '' the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate earth of 1988 and the world of fiction are completely in place when last we left the intrepid thursday next she had just saved the world of fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil goliath corporation thursday 's finally given birth to a son friday who at two year old only speaks in lorem ipsum a good example of the craziness of fforde 's vision deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin she returns to earth and winds up becoming the target of an assassin the coach of her town 's professional croquet team the thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional the hostess to hamlet prince of denmark the wife to her exterminated unexterminated husband the finder of a live clone of william shakespeare the friend of neanderthals everywhere dead twice the holder of the secrets of the apocalypse the savior of the planet if you think that 's about three books in one well that pegs something rotten '' fforde packs this book so full of plot and that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once that fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series the eyre affair '' while not as inventive as his previous book the well of lost plots '' fforde 's is largely done so something rotten '' can focus on the story and not on backstory that 's a big plus longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book for instance we finally get to see who millon de floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an england overrun with mammoths dodos and neanderthals all the typical humor that we 've come to expect from fforde is here and he 's done well picking up the mantle of douglas adams someone has to write nutty british and fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now and while something rotten '' is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the thursday next books for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books enjoy
i really like this book it 's simple to follow instructions and there is good advice all the way thru it everything from the author 's mom 's advice to what to do to jazz up a low fat high flavor recipe to make it more flexible tastier or fancy enough for company i like kd 's tv show on food tv and i liked her first book this book is better than the first i am eating more healthfully is that a word and keep taking the small steps kd recommends to keep doing even better i highly recommend the book
i always look to see if an author stands in their truth if they walk their talk christiane northrup does i have read all of her books women 's bodies women 's wisdom the wisdom of menopause and now wisdom they all embody her path to and her knowledge on the subject of women 's health in her book wisdom she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness i find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy relationship i have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up i found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship she addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way she talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter this book is also a reference book as northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter 's life mothers men and women without children would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter
as the authors state in the preface of the book the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts this is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate most of the examples presented in the book are written in eiffel an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing if you have n't written code in eiffel i highly recommend that you download eiffelstudio and deploy the examples in this book although there are tools that offer assertion facilities none provide the ease of use as that seen in the eiffel language the text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to java but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer 's environment that minimally supports the functionality as such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool the keyword support of contracts in eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions the authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts as a sometimes eiffel developer i can state that this assertion is accurate since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors they are invaluable for debugging i recall an instance when i encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the eiffel library as a client of the class i did n't spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier in industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent '' report requested by java developers the book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the observer pattern i considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules introduced successively via examples provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than i had employed in the past in chapter 2 the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure in the development of the dictionary class in chapter 3 the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key the query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions this is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class in chapter 6 the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic in particular the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and uml diagrams the concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained chapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts the stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution analysis by contract introduced in the final chapter presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics the authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank in doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification '' the obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly this is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages in the future as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly i suspect that all of these texts will reference design by contract by example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book
this book is a must have for anyone applying six sigma to real world problems not only do i use it on a nearly daily basis i 'm finding that my engineers are embracing the terminology and concepts so clearly conveyed in this text we 're spending at each staff meeting to review topics from basic statistics to advanced application of teaming concepts to get results instead of the usual soft stuff application examples that seem to illustrate that the author thinks everyone 's making clothes pins pyzdek 's book shows that he 's really lived this stuff i highly recommend this book to anyone serious about applying six sigma for results joe maciulla manager manufacturing engineering systems raytheon missile system
this book is an almost encylocpedic digest of current theories of thoroughbred handicapping none are covered in such detail that you can run off and start making money at the track but each points you to a source for more comprehensive information on the theory that interests you if you are willing to ignore books on handicapping made easy '' this book is probably among the best starting points for the novice it explores a variety of approaches leaving you to select what you like and follow a path toward mastery
oz talks sense from the first chaper i was hooked she suggested making a minor change for the first week i cut back on one soft drink per day from 3 down to 2. that was quite painless i also took her starter tips drink water before meals and do n't eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime again those were minor and did n't crimp my style this is not really a diet book though it deals with diet as in what you eat it 's really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard and ultimately failing oz is a vegetarian but she said that red meat was fine in moderation go for only twice per week on that she suggested i love beef but i also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan chips are junk food but a bowl is n't a huge deal just do n't grab the bag and keep munching if you have an urge for chocolate melt some chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate it really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate that 's typical of her advice and things that i can handle and maintain she also talks about exercise and about supplements meant to supplement and not take the place of good food she 's reasonable with her ideas here as well i added some extra work out time even jogging 5 minutes while watching tv adds up if you do it pretty often and bought a basic vitamin plus b c and e all heartily approved by my doc oz lost 10 pounds her first semester this is not a crash course she 's down 30 lbs now over 2 years i think just slowly and surely and she 's maintained rather than i think most people college or not would benefit from reading this book and trying out oz 's common sense plan older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that is n't painful and does work this would be a great book for anyone females more so headed off to college or in college oz has dealt with being overweight she did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action i think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier
imaginary playmates are not unusual but there has n't been a playmate like tillytilly since those nasties henry james created in turn of the screw '' and like them tillytilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined jessamy harrison the daughter of a nigerian mother and a british father is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks during a visit to her nigerian relatives jess explores an abandoned building and meets tillytilly a child of her own age who she befriends the problem is no one else can see tillytilly on their return to england tillytilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads jess into a heap of trouble fun becomes horror as tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty given that miss oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel there are some drawbacks jess is often portrayed as much more sophisticated and articulate than the reader can believe and some characters are not drawn out enough despite these flaws maturity is certain to give us a writer well worth watching for in the future
this is a very involved book bringing to light all the past and present characters i loved it it was nice to see the history of o'connor and his mentor jack i thought burke pulled this one off nicely with the mystery being spread over a yr timeframe nice job it was nice to see new characters introduced also i hope to see them in future books if you have n't read this series you could probably get away with starting out with this book i have to tell you though that you are missing a lot by not reading all of the other books in the irene kelly series
once again david mccullough 's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind this biography reads like a fascinating novel and mcculloughs narrative ability is unmatched no one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can the great theodore roosevelt known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong tough larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling the book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage the man who would become president of the united states best of all is that mccullough likes and admires his subject this is not always the case with biographies roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve highly recommended as are all of mccullough 's books
i religiously '' read all of baldacci 's books he ca n't write them fast enough for me and this is one of his best ! i 'd give it 10 stars if i could
to surmise the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure i will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot i felt that like some of heinlein 's books the book is plauged with politics less science fiction the only thing about it is that the plot takes place in space other than that it 's all politics same thing with citizen of the galaxy a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray rather it shows heinlein 's knowledge in law i felt that the book could have been much better and i do n't see how it won the hugo award conclusion the book is a fun pass but nothing more do n't expect any groundbreaking plot or jaw dropping plot twists just your old fashioned
i am an inveterate map reader whenever i travel there is a map in my pocket but a recent trip to the middle east and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as i tried to put in context the ruins visited and the coins i collected with time the names of cities and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period morkot 's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps but the rationale and context for their evolution and change one of the best features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview followed by a series of accounts each from the perspective of the important players '' during a given historical period this approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the same information is repeated and new information added as each of the regions their politics and battles are succesively presented from the mycenae to the parthians are thousands of years thousands of miles and thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of influence affect us even today for the first time after years of puzzling over strange grecian place names and leaders i am now able to begin to understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the birth of christ i wish this had been the first book i read in my study of ancient history i can hardly wait to start on penguin 's sequel acient rome
good transaction thank you
if you wan na stop smoking then give this a go you 'll either stop right away or you 'll never beleive your doomed to puff on for life either way you win strange thing to say about a book but true i say amazing stuff
i like most of jack kornfield 's work and this book is no exception it has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths the focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences also it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions there is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general jack kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely in one section he quotes ram dass who once was asked did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied but i 've become a connoisseur of my neurosis '' in another section jack talks about vocation or purpose in life i found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful while the book is good i think you may get more out of the audio cd because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections i think this carries a part of the communication that does n't come across in his books my favorite taped work by jack kornfield is your buddha nature this is on the 10 paramitas perfections and i think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life if you like after the ecstasy the laundry you may want to consider purchasing this as well
this book is inspiring ! the coverage is very broad and it can serve as a handbook for graduate students even the hardest bits of econometrics are explained in an easy to understand way my personal favourites are chapters 16 17 and 18. i will definetely buy a hardcover of the next edition of this econometrics masterpiece summing up it 's one of my favourite books
this book is full of useful insights i was fortunate to hear reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals while some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic i doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business i applied his methodology to my business direct selling and had over interviews completed to identify promoters passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors consistent with reichheld 's findings the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics from the detailed findings we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business buy the book have an open mind apply the concepts he has laid out if you do you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
this series of books is a beast that has possessed me with its great storylines characters and cliffhanger endings kudoes to lahaye
bishop presents an entertaining history of bees and beekeeping and gives us an absolutely fascinting tour into the relationship between humans and bees both ancient and modern what she misses are her science references on page 142 bishop recounts the removal of a stinger he grabbed the whole sac which simply squeezed in more venom '' this is not true it is an piece of conventional wisdom but in 1996 entomologists at uc riverside published an article in the lancet with the conclusion that rather than removal method speed is of the essence visscher and vetter wrote of their conclusion the method of removal is irrelevant but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly or getting out a knife blade or credit card are likely to increase the dose of venom received the advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed and as quickly as possible '' on page 276 bishop writes about royal jelly worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs one of which on this special diet will grow into a queen '' this is patently incorrect royal jelly as all beekeepers know is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first days of the brood 's development after this time most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives it is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge this was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as i have enjoyed the book very much and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment otherwise this is quite a good absorbing read
very good book she did it again draws you in so you can relate to all characters and their issues book 2 stayed interesting continuously looking forward to book 3
truman capote 's wrote the grass harp early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem this sweet eccentric moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared closeness is established and love blooms flannery o'connor meets swiss family robinson with a dash of steel magnolias themes of finding one 's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative it has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth primary assets are the thick as molasses '' southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters
the big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex few of us ever wake up to the mental that society has put us in and fewer still escape anne lamott 's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating once you get past this junk you begin to see you do n't really need books telling you how to write at all you just need to write

of all the articles and books of chomsky that i have read necessary illusions thought control in democratic societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched and footnoted the most logically structured and the most convincing chomsky reminds us that the majority of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their information about political affairs both domestic and foreign one can only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic so take for example the popular myth of the 'persistent soviet vetoe ' at the un during the cold war why do people believe the ussr was constantly vetoeing any and every security council resolution simple ! when they did it generated front page condemnation when the us or the uk exercised their right of veteo silence as chomsky notes during the years of 1970 and 1989 the former soviet union veteod 8 resolutions the us veteod some 56. this is what chomsky refers to as thought control unless the public examine the factual record of the un themselves they will never come by this information at least not in the mainstream press so although chomsky 's title may appear somewhat paradoxical or oxymoronic a moments reflection on such facts shows it to be in fact extremenly pragmatic and truthful the question is have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs the crux of chomsky 's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship chomsky points out that in fact propaganda is contrary to popular postulations more important and vital to a democratic society because people still have some rights that is since people can talk the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words come out of the peoples ' mouths in a dictatorship it does not really matter too much what people think for whatever they may think they have to do what they are told by pain of death in countries such as the us and the uk other more subtle methods are required people often critisise chomsky for the sources of his information the copious footnotes no such critique can be levelled at this work chomsky 's sources are declassified internal planning documents naval proceedings documents and the very institutions he examines new york times washington post etc if there was one chomsky book i would suggest you to read this would be it

pat was right ! anyone read the news lately bush has succeeded only in creating more terrorists mission accomplished buchanan may have some whacky views about illegal aliens but he knows his foreign policy when it comes to warfare and economics if he and ralph nader did n't dislike eachother so much they would no doubt make the best running mates this country has seen in half a century
east of eden '' is a beautifully written sprawling three generation saga of the men and women who settled the salinas valley in california the story begins far away in the east on the farm of the unscrupulous cyrus trask and his two sons adam and charles adam is an upright honest young man who naturally draws people to him while charles has an angry violent spirit charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father and takes his anger at his failure out on adam adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love but cyrus keeps charles close to home knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son adam wanders for many years across the country after his service and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp closely mirroring steinbeck 's own experiences during the depression finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with charles until the mysterious cathy arrives the more astute charles quickly realizes her true nature but innocent adam marries her and they move to california adam expects cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch but cathy is a vicious evil character with no redeeming qualities and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to much later when her sons are grown adam hibernates for many years on the ranch over cathy 's desertion and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever which become an impossible task repeating the pattern of their father 's life the twins aron and caleb vie for their father 's love with aron effortlessly winning it while caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit but this time around caleb is redeemed in a way charles never was steinbeck 's prose is masterful and his descriptions of the salinas valley lush with the rains brutal with the drought capture exactly why men were drawn to the west his portrayals of character and motives sadly lacking in the movie are totally convincing and his adam is a flawed but admirable character steinbeck has been a bit out of favor at least until this was chosen as an oprah book as an teacher i recently taught the pearl '' and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery we all read it in high school but i now realize it went right over my head try steinbeck again you wo n't be disappointed my book club was n't !
if you liked empire you 'll love multitude the authors and reviewers alike speak of multitude as a follow up to empire but i think something very different is happening here hardt and negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory and in multitude they have attained a of perception well beyond empire if you are attempting to learn your radicalism or inform your progressivism through hardt and negri then you may see multitude as continuing from and expanding empire and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books but what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book where empire was the best try we had at the time multitude now succeeds where the digression in empire circled around the feeling of our hematopoiesis the discursion in multitude captures it fukuyama attempted to deal with multitude in the july nyt book review and either utterly failed at or purposefully decided to avoid addressing the book qua philosophy at this point in his apologizing for economists it is hard to imagine that fukuyama 's name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as hegel or that he has ever actually read any of the german idealists whereas with hardt and negri we almost have that level of man among us again for fukuyama history has indeed ended because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers for hardt and negri and for those who have read listened and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history we are indeed not at its end but at its very beginning the chief problem with this book is that the english language as a field of common meaning is not up to handling this level of thought anymore the very british cheery insufficiency of george monbiot 's 'manifesto for a new world order ' hardt and negri wrote multitude in english but were thinking in german that neoplatonic lego of a language so if you consider yourself progressive but ca n't get the feeling and sweep of multitude then trash your tv stop reading anything written after 1930 for a few years then come back to it you will find you have become allergic to cnn but you will also find that finally you can what the world and her history are all about
i found this to be a real it addressed all the issues leading to the near destruction of the high plains in the agricultural social political dealing heavily with accounts i learned about the dust bowl the depression and the psychology of the times great book
a very good crime fiction book connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you do n't have it already why it 's good 1 connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional believable realistic characters and this book is no different 2 a very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department he 's supposed to have been a crime beat writer 3 logical plot his books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers but they ca n't be if they are crime fiction rather he takes you through the investigation step by step going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime cons the only con i have is that the books are somewhat noir i 'm plagarizing this word from some other review the thing is bosch is not your spiffy yes sir '' toe the blue line cop and so even though you want bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes well c'est la vie apparently connelly likes to put angst in his readers ' lives i 'm not going to spoil the book if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro all i 'm trying to get across is why this book is good a must buy

this volume contains a lot of valuable information and is the only work of its kind i am aware of ie an exhaustive survey of worldwide charismatic christianity that alone earns it four stars however i was disappointed that the editors chose to write from a bias that may alienate indeed some of the shorter entries seem more like blurbs for the ministers and movements they represent rather than academic encyclopaedic introductions the problem is not with what information is included so much as what information is included for example absent from the entry on oral roberts is any mention of the dubious fundraising techniques and outrageous publicity stunts for which he is most in famous ian bilby 's entry details his leadership of elim new zealand but includes no mention of the sexual scandal that led to his removal as elim 's nz leader all but the most staggering embarrassments in pentecostalism 's history seem glossed over as if not offending anyone was a major principle in deciding what to include i would expect a scholarly work to reflect both the glory and the shame of this important subject this is an annoyance in an otherwise very good work

any beginner or intermediate learner who wants to be enlightened on the basic mechanisms of both computer and its peripheral devices would be laying a good foundation by starting with this book without compromising its concise outlook the coverage of this book is as comprehensive as it is illustrative its updated chapters are although that anyone who currently owns the seventh or even the sixth edition would not be missing much by sticking with either editions despite being labelled how computers work '' the contents of this book are not limited to pcs they covered other related issues like networking multimedia printers software and so on detailed explanations which are frequently complemented by graphics are abundant this book literally takes its reader into the 'engine room ' that keeps a computer running it is an impressive virtual tour on paper ! however if you are an advanced learner this book will be of little use to you in fact there is hardly anything in it that any advanced learner has not come across likewise stalwarts need not invest in it its focus is entirely on the pc with no room for mac the uniqueness of this book is plausible it is a welcomed advantage every pc component as well as peripherals are laid bare it is a resourceful tools for beginners a worthy and dependable guide for any novice

this book was like madonna 's famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960 's this is brown 's manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era reader beware choices and actions have consequence and ponder very carefully before being cosmopolitan long after the expiration date living it up does not mean reckless behavior values are personal but when one woman 's values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another ie affairs with married men it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others ' heads people are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them although now dated and updated with sex and the city ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right helen gurley brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers enjouing the single life and having an identity but too much too long has a cost do you really want to be like brown and her counterpart hefner 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth
this review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on italian cooking for the last 10 years this book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of italian cooking this book is full of both information and recipes this was one of my first italian cookbooks and is still one of my favorites this book is an authentic italian cookbook not the type that we are accustomed to in the usa if you want a good comprehensive book on authentic italian food this is one of the books that i would recommend however if you are a beginner italian cook this is not the book for you the directions are written for someone that is familiar with the italian kitchen the author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the italian kitchen and typical recipes one complaint and it is minor is the lack of glossy photographs that i have become so accustomed to in cookbooks the recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about italian cooking
before the epiricist philosophers came along it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning thus complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic working off what was assumed to be true then hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories relations of ideas and matters of fact relations of ideas are things that a true by defintion will always equal 4 because that is how it is defined try as we might we can never successfully imagine equalling 5. so relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world they are definitions we use to describe what is happening matters of fact on the other hand are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world such as the sun will rise tomorrow morning '' unlike with relations of ideas matters of fact are not true my their defintition we can imagine successfully the sun will not rise tomorrow '' how then if we can imagine the supposed impossible do we know anything to be truly impossible hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry he effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true it was n't until kant 's critique of pure reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of hume 's metaphysics this is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers

i really enjoyed this book from beginning to end there are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share i am glad this story was n't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate for the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new it is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she 's lost i could read this novel over and over the deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage 's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail

ayn rand 's masterwork earns its reputation as a monumentally influential book it is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957. altas shrugged lays out in the form of a sprawling novel rand 's philosophy objectivism it has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by americans as the second most influencial to them trailing only the bible atlas shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society people who invent design build manufacture improve and manage she lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone 's standard of living while they improved their own mysteriously society 's producers start vanishing one at a time until almost none are left the outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from the decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away rand reminds us of this critical but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way read it and then tell ten friends to read it too more of us need to see this side of the story the fact that it 's unpopular right now just makes it that much more fun
if you are going to read only one of virginia woolf 's many works this is the one to read she is the greatest novelist but her novels can not be equal some being better or more universal than others she really in this one i first read it twenty years ago in college but i still think of phrases thoughts and concepts from this book the novel 's themes resonate the way poetry does worth the reputation i hope no one ever tries to make a movie out of this one
horowitz with the help of researchers provides glimpses of the 101 most dangerous academics in america '' your own political outlook will determine whether you think horowitz is an american hero or a buffoon i 'll vote for american hero as horowitz provides details on professors whose very existence on a campus should motivate people concerned for their children and the destiny of the united states to march on the legislatures that use taxpayer funds to pay most of these academics '' demanding their immediate termination college has changed where the goal was once to teach young minds to think independently it is now a place for intdoctrination with punishment meted out for to the various doctrines being rammed down the throats of young adults the book is so densely packed that choosing representative excerpts could easily create a shorter bookof its own for example professor jose angel gutierrez opines w e have got to eliminate the gringo and what i mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst we have got to kill him '' this from a licensed attorney now a professor paid from the public purse taxpayer dollars alison jaggar another beneficiary of taxpayer money seeks to combat the structure of everyday life '' she seeks essentially a world without men not exactly an inclusive outlook the examples cited above are mild most are far worse and these are the people often supported by taxpayers in public colleges who are forcing their views into the minds of young people with tenure and increasing control of the hiring process other views are shut out of the academy the academy itself is being converted into a political training ground many of these radicals are tenured and can not be fired not even the likes of trask who says t he enemy is the united states of america and everyone who supports it '' she also advocates the deportation of all hawaiians from the islands and the taxpayers foot the bill for her to teach '' some of the names are familiar to many as talking heads such as joseph massad who demands the destruction of israel and denies that the jews are a nation imagine what happens to a student a jewish student in particular who disputes massad 's views this happened and massad screamed at the students when the matter was investigated a rarity massad conveniently could n't remember the incidents other of these professors make equally outlandish claims many of them based on race gender or sexual preference reading this book is a sure invitation to outrage and then depression as you realize that there is little the average citizen can do to stop what is happening unless citizens band together to create enough of an uproar as does happen on all too rare occasion a for anyone concerned with the fate of america 's young minds and the nation itself jerr

if not here is a chance to find out two figures left an imprint on the french art amidst the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century manet whom history dubbed the father of impressionism although at the time art critics branded him untalented and meissonier then the highest paid painters and now a figure obscured by history how did time turn the tables on these two characters why is meissonier forgotten while the manet 's paintings sell with 20 million price tag the answer is in this book king 's skillful examination of the art 's progression from its realism to the appearance of impressionism in the latter part of 1800 's makes for a delightful reading he analyzes the art critics of the time the leading political figures the consequences of a war with prussia the french life and french economy written with intellectual appeal and with an eye on the events that drove history the judgment of paris is highly recommend to all lovers of historical simon cleveland
this book is more dated than the secret garden but it 's still a great story it 's hard not to identify with sara crewe i loved this book as a child though not as much as i loved the secret garden which i think is a better book however a little princess may appeal more to some people some readers may find the story stronger and the main character sara crewe more likable sara 's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own some scenes i do n't want to spoil the surprise by describing them are magical a little princess is a great story that makes readers think some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children but that i think is part of the book 's greatness be sure to get an unabridged edition this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified kids now can read and will love this book at least every girl to whom i have given a copy has read it and reread it on her own for a modern book about another girl at an english boarding school read libby koponen 's blow out the moon it has the same classic feel though american heroine is very different from sara in some ways though she too is determined to hang onto her identity and moon is quite funny

we are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible ! without existing virtual technologies compiling a complete collection of the new yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations availability and of course the daunting financial investment for the price of a modest concert eighty years of intelligent discourse satire observation and fiction are all available i have nothing negative to say about this it does what it promises and does it well it still amazes me that i now have every issue of the new yorker and look forward to the continuation of this extraordinary trend of publications releasing the entirety of their output

this is a must read book not just once but many times each time you read it you understand and see a different view of the book one needs to read this book from the heart as the meaning of kokoro means from the heart the story of a married man yet lonely why he feels guilty about the death of his best friend a scholar with no ambition rich enough to enjoy a few simple things in life how he talks about the ending of his own life he is sure his wife will be taken care of after his death the student is confused i am confused read the book more than once each time you read put yourself in each characters shoe '' written with passion kokoro from the heart is this book fiction or you decide
jesse stone is sort of spenser 's alter ego he 's younger and spenser 's never had a drinking problem but other than that they 're pretty much the same character except stone 's about thirty years younger robert parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now this is the fourth stone novel there are 31 spenser novels three featuring his third character sunny randall and nine books that are n't part of a series some of them that 's 47 books for those who are n't keeping up with the math obviously by now parker knows what he 's doing he seems able to write one of these every six months or so he alternates between randall spenser and stone with ease and just floats along in this outing stone 's faced with a real problem paradise the town he 's chief of police in has been hit by a rash of killings and it 's soon apparent that they 're the work of a serial killer or killers stone has no way of tracking the killer at first and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish meanwhile there 's also a scared girl at the local high school the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards stone has to resolve things and control the situation so that the girl does n't get hurt and of course there 's his personal life which has been a problem for him since the series started with night passage his is a manipulative sociopath interested in only herself and how she can control him near as i can tell in this installment she attempts to manipulate him more than she should and things take some interesting turns i enjoyed this book a great deal and i would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading
jane hirshfield and mariko aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity i had a friend who was a japanese scholar who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka i have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called on japanese poetry and the process of translation '' i recommend it highly even if you do not normally read this kind of essay i am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on ono no komachi and izumi shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and ono no komachi was one of the rokkasen the six best waka poets of the early heian period the reason that i am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself these poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship they are strong and sad and very affecting there is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves so i will close this review with one of the poems by shikibu what is the use of cherishing life in spring its flowers only shackle us to this world
before reading this book i 'd had a much more mostly black impression of jewish life in medieval and early modern europe this volume presents a much more nuanced picture ghetto walls were an injustice but also a refuge for many jews from the tense environment around them oddly enough this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to christianity in the liberal west after the napoleonic liberations in contrast to the shtetl jews in poland and russia who lived with gentile neighbors katz 's discussions of of jewish martyrs during the first crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa among other topics are also quite fascinating
this is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject what happens at death or near death it is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor and in spite of the fact that i am a christian with conservative beliefs and even though i maintain my faith carefully focused on god i do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence along with its companion written subsequently life beyond death '' i invite you to read it and see why
i actually enjoyed this book very much i was in a romance slump and needed something different well i got it there is no need to give a synopsis of the story my predecessors have done an excellent job the only thing i really want to say is that i really really liked muriel and edward the dog
wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation ' to 'civilize ' the world read colonize for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that and although he did n't knock it down he made his and in spectacular fashion in one way the martians the conquering british with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells ' dark tale was also a warning that even the despite their firm belief in their world could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british or anyone else 's false boast of superiority in the end though it 's a hopeful just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british alien way was not the native way of life in the colonies suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense and that 's why it 's still in print a hundred years later wakely author of an audience for einstei
this is the stupidest review i have read so far on this site the person who wrote it has no idea what they are talking about i seriously doubt they even considered reading the book i have n't but i 've been poor and i 've been on welfare you should know something about a subject before you spout off
i just finished reading the hitorian the first 400 pages were so compelling that i could hardly put it down then it became soooo boring it literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400. i just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head thinking this has to get better considering how good the first 's were i also have to say that i was disappointed with the ending it was way too contrived for me spoiler i found it extremely unbelievable that dracula would 'assume ' that helen died in the fall and not gone after her as the author states when helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall i mean come on dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world now were supposed to believe that he simply says damn she fell i guess after all i 've been through i wo n't bother to check i 'll just find another victim '' sorry did n't buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the overall the book was really great fascinating reading for the dracula fan just wish the ending held up to the beginning
wendell jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat the verdict was suicide but the insurance company that had sold him a dollar insurance policy is not convinced when 5 years passed the company was forced to pay the premium to jaffe 's wife two months later a man looking very much like jaffe is spotted in mexico the insurance company hires private investigator kinsey millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be jaffe along with his girlfriend renata they escape kinsey 's surveillance and she returns to california jaffe 's son brian is in big trouble with the police and kinsey concludes that jaffe will return to help his son as she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with jaffe 's supposed widow and his two troubled sons she also comes in contact with some of her family and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them and open up old wounds sue grafton can be relied on to provide a good read and this book although not the best in the series is no exception
this is one of nora roberts ' best books ever ! i have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite i adore this book the characters are interesting and very human the plot is gripping and the background fascinating callie an archeologist comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment like most romances including roberts definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
as usual robin cook keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end excellent reading
i started the book last night and could n't put it down until 4 am but at least i finished it ! it was a good storyline i enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world it also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general i really liked the characters in this book although each one in my opinion could have used some more depth the only reason this book does n't get 5 stars is because as you read it you start to feel that the second half of the book with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book was completely rushed i really do n't like a sudden closing to a book however it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages i just feel that it could have had more of an impact and more of that umph '' had the story been written at the same speed throughout i do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read if you 're looking for something you will remember for life this is n't going to be it but if you 're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon by all means try reading mary jane clark 's do you etc '' final word i believe her the other clark would be quite proud of her in law the woman can write however given her talents i wish she would learn to write in her own style instead of in the familiar style of the other clark
truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever ! were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh this is the best medicine
reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that foucault points to profit and capitalism with the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than 'off with their head ' or hands the panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like carnegie and rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by gps social security cards public schooling founded by the same industrial giants intellectual and psychological grading job placement and conformity credit ratings licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom a growing snitch culture foucault 's major thesis is that surveillance discipline aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to punishment in the form of increased surveillance as industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly every facet of modern society works to this end the irony is as like mccluhan later pointed out in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication everything that stands in the way of the profit order whether it be an idea person religion or country is attacked bottom line we are all 'human resources ' in the political economy in the religion of capital packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else the inanity and inherent fraud of our system not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like foucault of all his books this is also the easiest read this is a beautiful book by a complicated man by the way he taught at the university of buffalo for a short time
when i thought there were not any more sex techniques '' i could learn from a book this book just amazed with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed this book can make you a better lover husband or sex partner for sure
hannah arendt 's origins of is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century soviet communism and nazism and traces their historical roots the book is divided into three volumes focusing on antisemitism imperialism and totalitarianism the first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of antisemitism arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of antisemitism for example some historians have argued based on a scapegoat theory '' that the jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world 's ills arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the jews arendt explores the rise of antisemitism in the birth of the the emancipation of the jews the rise of the jewish financiers the roles of jews within society and the infamous dreyfus affair of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as benjamin disraeli or the infamous forgery the protocols of the elders of zion the idea that the jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of antisemitism the second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of imperialism here a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as count arthur de gobineau and various forms of social darwinism the role of the boers in south africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as cecil rhodes who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic nordic elite is made the great pan movements and the of lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored the final volume of this book is concerned with totalitarianism proper here the role of propaganda and the secret police as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in nazi germany and soviet russia arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent written during the cold war period and just after the second world war this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as adolf hitler and josef stalin their movements of nazism and soviet communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished the book is important today not only for historical reasons but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world
i found airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation i was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary the media that being said i was not the least disappointed in his typical style crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain english i learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry it was fascinating he also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals which was fun and somewhat ironic from the creator of er '' ! the book is fast paced and reads like a movie which i am sure is no coincidence by crichton SMILE the main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her there are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages in summary i would not say that this is crichton 's best work but it is surely a very enjoyable book that i would recommend to everyone
i love this book i have read this book in three different languages german english and french it 's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids ! this book has a lot of great quotes like '' on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur l'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux '' you really should read it
this is not the book for you if you 're impatient with precision and specifics if you want good results you 'll do what michael recchiuti tells you to do you 'll buy the butter you 'll use the or valrhona and chuck the hershey 's and you 'll be so glad you did because every recipe and i mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes i have tried from this book thus far has been fantastic i would not call this a good beginner 's cookbook though the photography is gorgeous enough to qualify this as a coffee table book even for those who do n't want to get in the kitchen some baking experience is helpful as is a kitchen immersion blender pots for sauces etc this is an outstanding book and i highly recommend it
for those who have not read volume 1 just get book 2 and get all the great information plus lots more being a christian some of the dialogue is beyond my belief system but just glean the book and keep the great stuff if your faith is just look at this as a first class medical journal and forget the buddhist hogwash
if you 've been given this book or recommended it by a friend then you 've been blessed this book is bizarre yes but if it finds its way to you i 'm sure you wo n't be troubled by that minor detail thank you elisabeth haich for this book it 's a gift i ca n't possibly explain in words the effect this book had on my life nevermind fathom how the author used words to discuss topics which have traditionally defied discussion i still ca n't believe that this book actually exists but i 'm eternally thankful it does
roddick has managed to put together some important issues outstanding commentators and good information design in one place with this book i read it through from i seldom do this and found myself both enlightened and inspired i recommend it highly
i 've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title and i must strongly disagree malphurs ' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches i have found to date in place of the term advanced '' in the title a better word would be comprehensive '' nonetheless malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight as a pastor of twenty years i wish this book had been available when i first started in ministry i hope this title is now offered in many seminaries because its content would be a gold mine for young church leaders pastors church staff members and lay leaders this volume is a in my opinion it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership
i am from yazoo city so this book has always been one of my favorites i saw willie morris at a car wash in jackson ms not long before his death i was shy and did n't want to bother him so i did n't introduce myself and have a chat i would have loved to have spoken with him now i regret my shyness should 've taken the chance yazoo city has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories no matter where i live it will always be home there is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever i drive into the city limits it is a feeling of home not many people have that sense of home these days i feel blessed to have grown up there

a great reference book to have for any designer although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject i would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things typographical since reading i have become more critical of typography in general and it works as a great guide when in doubt

the 2005 nobel prize for economics was awarded to robert aumann and thomas schelling schelling is professor of economics at the university of maryland and applied game theory to conflict his focus was on the weapons issues but his ideas have been applied to a host of business issues in this review we will apply some of shelling 's concepts to how companies fire employees schelling says uncertain retaliation is more efficient than certain retaliation '' when bargaining and the capability to retaliate is more useful than the ability to defend '' now let 's get practical goodbye scenario as a verb goodbye '' is the act of parting it is also an acknowledgement of parting a goodbye scenario assumes that once employees physically leave the building they will never be a factor for the company 's future the relationship was transactional and the transaction is now over if the firm defines the termination as a goodbye scenario the firm should be guided by a business model that says what 's the least expensive way of terminating this relationship '' and board members should ask tough questions about paying too much auwiedersehen scenario '' auwiedersehen '' is german for until we meet again '' it has a more quality than the english goodbye '' in an auwiedersehen scenario the assumption is that once employees physically leave the building they may continue to be a factor in the firm 's future but it is unclear what that factor may be after their contracts are over they may join a smaller competitor and become potential allies or opponents in your firm 's efforts to develop strategic alliances or acquire the firm they may join firms that touch your industry and become potential referral sources of new business for you or a potential source of caution to others about using your company they may attend alumni programs at their schools and graduates from joining your firm each of these scenarios assumes capability of retaliation plus uncertainty of retaliation the best practical defense in terminating employees under these conditions is treat people with dignity on the way out because the assured costs of such positive treatment are less than the potential downside retaliatory risks auwiedersehen vs it 's nice to be nice we work with companies that treat departing leaders with dignity on the grounds that it is good public relations and good for morale if we help former employees achieve a landing ' '' this positive rationale works only in cultures supportive of such a rationale the schelling rationale does not depend on an organizion having a specific culture for treating people with dignity it develops a contingency approach to management based on a risk assessment there may be times when a goodbye '' scenario does indeed make good sense there are other times when auwiedersehen '' makes better economic sense in applying professor schelling 's theories management 's failure to take defensive measures with those possessing abilities and options to retaliate is is just bad economics one sees it at work every day
what fun ! this hilarious book is filled with richman 's amusing culinary observations and adventures during his long and impressive career as gq 's food wine and restaurant critic it is the perfect winter read and holiday gift it is witty engaging and even touching at times my mother said it was the only thing that made her laugh out loud during her double knee replacement rehab ! i am giving this book to all my friends this year
this is n't really a novel and it is n't really a collection of short stories but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time as he imagines einstein envisioned them each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time time is money time flows uphill live in the present forget the past time is motion etc lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing each could be the setting for powerful stories it 's a quick read a fun read and well worth the 'time ' cv ric
it 's been a while since i 've read one of janet evanovich 's stephanie plum novels but a sudden need for light reading found ten big ones at the book store plum 's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after joe morelli or ranger how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed definitely light fare even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic he not only wants stephanie dead but he also wants her end to be spectacular stephanie 's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend joe morelli again gorge on jelly donuts and go into hiding at one of ranger 's lairs of course this does n't work as well as it should because even ranger 's soap is too sexy for words and stephanie glutton for punishment that she is she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile so you see this is standard stephanie plum fare lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss usually with bad timing my issue with evanovich 's books is n't with any particular one but with what happens if you read too many at one time stephanie 's biggest problem is herself a decided lack of common sense which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter but leaves her gun in the cookie jar in four hundred pages this is funny but if you 've been reading a lot in a row the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is vu all over again after a break of a year or so this goes away and i found ten big ones a pleasure to read it introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history by all means if you need a break from the weight of the world take the time to read this
i 've long been a fan of borges the short fiction writer but this little book has made me an instant fan of borges the reader and borges the literary critic i have to admit that so much of petry mystifies me but within the pages of this book i felt as if borges ' insight was finally allowing me to understand poetry in a way i had n't considered before witty modest and polymathic borges shines through the pages of this book you can read it in an hour but if you read it for 1 week straight you still would n't be able to appreciate all the gems of wisdom in it great stuff
i enjoyed this book it focuses mainly on franklin 's time abroad in england and france and gives an overview on who franklin was and how he interacted on the world stage during the revolutionary period i believe it 's very accessible and would be a good starting place for anyone interested in franklin 's life he 's funny
all right all right i say so i 'm writing about a preteen book about a little girl that does n't make me weird does it it should n't since i had to read it for a college course so i 'm writing because well who would 've ever guessed but i loved it it 's a ripping story man it is funny inventive historic and riveting all the things i was sure it would n't be when i got assigned the book so here i am blown away by a book about a little girl i do n't even like history but it was n't presented as antiquated it was dealt with as you and i would deal with our history as pertinent in the moment and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book i 'm telling you the character darby is great as are all the characters including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon etc until darby unintentionally questions everything causing all matter of problems like maybe she 'll get knocked off by the klan the story is actually something you 'll find yourself absolutely focused on i could n't put it down i 've read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class and i can say that if i had a kid i 'd be pouring this down their brain so does that make me weird who cares huh i had to read the book for my class and i 'm happy i did
i decided to read this book because i enjoyed o'connor 's book undoing depression so much i am delighted to report that undoing perpetual stress is an even better book what is perpetual stress like the metaphor that o'connor uses is that of an impala who thinks there 's a cheetah behind every rock the flight or fight response is never at rest and the poor impala 's health is soon destroyed o'connor argues that our over stimulating world creates the same kinds of stress from unseen threats '' as the world goes whizzing by at 75 miles per hour in the book he describes the sources of the stress how stress undermines your body immune system brain and mind and what you can do to put the stress comfortably in the background this book will appeal to those who are stressed out those who experience anxiety and depression at the same time those who love such people and those who want to better understand the connection based on the latest scientific research undoing perpetual stress is filled with many helpful exercises that will help even those who do n't think they have too much stress one of the best from my perspective was taking a psychological snapshot of yourself every five years and spotting what was wrong with your life at each stage i was astonished to realize how many memories i had repressed but which are still influencing my psychology and o'connor is good about reminding you to practice practice practice '' the exercises and his advice i have been a meditator for over ten years and this book helped me to gain a lot of perspective on what the meditation is helping and what it is not while i have eliminated a lot of the background noise i have n't dealt with a lot of old issues it was helpful to find out what those issues are and what to do about them i found that my creativity and mind were suddenly freed by the process for parents there 's a lot of new information here on how various parenting methods influence a child over a lifetime it 's a lot better than what you read in that first book about how to be a parent check it out ! this book should be required reading for anyone who finishes high school
when i saw the cover of this book i had a feeling i would love it the picture of the little boy on the cover flexing his muscles is something i have seen my three sons do many many times when i opened it and started to read wonderful memories flooded back of when my sons were younger i laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories if you have sons or have friends that have sons this book is a must i will be buying my friends who are mothers of sons this for christmas
few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece this is one of them thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native athens is remarkable for it 's candor despite events that must have been tragically painful the text includes legendary personalities pericles alcibiades demosthenes nicias etc their actions words and fate facts license readers to decide what 's important and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity who would have thought the promise of persian defeat told by herodotus would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved athens ' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic given recent attempts to democratize the middle east melos destiny at athens ' hands may give pause as may the syracuse expedition especially book seven i read warner 's translation thirty years ago it was then and still turn to it from time to time also recommended landmark thucydides ' robert strassler victor davis hanson this is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes
i too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as i wanted this is a perfect metaphor for the book when all you 've ever wanted is n't enough '' the book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside that always seems to want something more until they arrive at that something more '' people can never truly feel content as is the case with most of kushner 's writing he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation in this case he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of ecclesiastes this book of the bible finds its author searching for more in life in the end the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance kushner 's overall point is best summarized on page 189. does it make a difference if i am honest good or faithful it does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune it matters if we are true to ourselves to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them it matters if we learn how to share our lives with others making them and their world different rather than try and hoard life to ourselves it matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day food and work and love and friendship as encounters with the divine encounters that teach us not only that god is real but that we are real too '' it is a simple yet beautiful message people that live this message will certainly discover the beauty in their life
this is on the dick van dyke show '' but it 's really far more than that it is the finest book on a tv sitcom i 've ever come across waldron painstakingly discusses everything you 'd ever want to know about the show and he interviewed seemingly everyone connected with the show including carl reiner mary tyler moore dick larry matthews rose marie and many of the writers if you 're a dvds fan you 've gottta have this tome on hand i ca n't recommend it highly enough i fervently hope vince will do subsequent books on cheers '' and other sitcoms he 's the only man for the job
i purchased this book after having seen super size me and i was a little worried that there would be nothing new for morgan to present i however was proven wrong this is a very good read that is able to put down more statistics and specifics about the food industry that the movie was not as focuses on the movie of course was focused mostly on the fast food industry morgan spurlock is always a surprise you seem him with his long sideburns and know he is from west virginia and you just expect the stereotype he is not a stereotype the book is written in a very clear voice the same intelligent humorous voice that came across in the movie super size me '' my one disappointment is that i was hoping the book would have more details about the diet that his girlfriend put him on when he finished his 30 days but now i see she has her own book ah marketing ! i think you can read this as stand alone but as everyone notes it works great in conjunctions with the movie to help you not forget
the nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the outsider 's incorrect perceptions or the insider 's preconceptions depending on which is constructing the definition what we find with cash 's the mind of the south is no different although it is a pleasant journey sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing cash 's work deserves recognition for this reason alone yet there is value in the exposition itself even if it forgets a full of the south 's population in its description blacks and women what the modern reader is left with then is not so much a description of the the southern mind '' as it is the white southern male mind '' and while cash 's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the american south with a small dash of glory added for good measure first it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by bertram shows that cash 's battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the south as was his upbringing seems to agree with my assessment on the effect the origins of cash 's interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of southern intransigence about issues of race and change but in the very makeup of his mind like so many creative depressives he stood apart from the society around him such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society can not obtain cash xxvii '' with this statement makes cash an by virtue of his being a manic depressive he is a southerner and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner however according to by reason of his mental condition he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether a presumably better one i would agree with this if the work itself is to be taken as proof cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society however and this is crucial ! we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work cash loses some credibility it is here it seems that cash could not escape the insider mentality this work is characterized by one theme southern culture though as elusive in most respects as any other is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament in essence this work is interpretative rather than linear as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate this elevates cash from the traditional historian in the mold of clement eaton to sociologist or social commentator in the mold of david halberstam that is not to say that cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others it seems impossible after reading the mind of the south for one to imagine cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind the disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent cash is who we hear while we read and it is his elucidative that paint the image of the southerner much is left out of this short review of cash 's work as brevity is a consideration a more complex examination of the work would require many more words than i have time for at the moment but i do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of cash 's masterpiece the first few chapters lay the groundwork for cash 's southern temperament individualistic violent provincial just to name a few while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within and its own natural need to adapt the yankee plays his part as does uncle tom and the fugitive slave the southern belle and the garrison abolitionist the and the scalawag the confederate soldier and the lynch mob the and the revivalist it is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber that being said it is still remarkable that the american south came as close as it did
this is another collection of barry 's columns and a surefire hit for any fan as usual his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke language person makes an appearance or two in this collection and barry also takes on tv commericials his relationship with his wife and always a winner the life of his teenaged son recommended
while i agree with several people who do n't consider this i do n't see why that is a bad thing i enjoyed radish 's writing style purple prose and all if you 're expecting a dickensian journey into a complex character this book is not it however it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life yes the positive and negative circumstances of meg 's life were unrealistic but i felt they were dramatized to make a point we all have strong kind and amazing people in our lives but we have to look for these things in people i had an aunt just like marcia who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor courage and love for everyone around her the message i took from this book is this life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you it does n't take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life
kudos to finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter the fact that he himself a descendent of holocaust survivors has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points you can not criticize the state of israel or its proponents without being labeled an any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless un resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism by far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the swiss banks this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work hilberg 's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight and those unfamiliar with his seminal set the destruction of european jews would be well served to check it out
not only was the book cheaper on amazon than the bookstores but i ordered this book for my boyfriend from here and i got it earlier than expected so that was great ! he says it has great images and that 's a positive for him since he learns more from visuals also it has instructions that he 's able to follow and understand we both just wish it had more food art '' in the book but overall it 's a great book
we have enjoyed another of eric carle 's books brown bear brown bear what do you see since my son was a few weeks old so when my son was about 7 months old i bought from head to toe it was a wonderful purchase ! after a few reads my son was imitating the animals just like his mama waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat it was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books i read to him

i am a total addict of leslie sansone 's walk away programs i had many exercise videos but never stuck to anything until i found her energizing fun and most of all easy workouts in her personal style leslie shows you how regular exercise benefits you in all ways from your health to your body to your mind and then presents her easy to follow basic workout which consists of three walking steps that are interchanged and sometimes modified while doing the program there is no dieting in this program ! she is a strong proponent of getting up and moving to better your life and shows it here by offering a few modifications you can make to your way of eating to help you lose weight but no real diet which i think is great ! it helps to show that the real health factor is getting the exercise you need not feeling deprived of the food you want which is why many diets fail she has many success stories to motivate you peppered throughout the book and closes with a discussion about how stress affects your life and how you can beat it through exercise i love leslie ! she is personable motivating and a great teacher i am forever grateful to her for getting this former couch potato mom to stick to an exercise routine that i know will always benefit my life

this book was originally published ca 1980 as england and always i have not seen the original so i ca n't tell how much of this book is new material beyond a chapter dealing with peter jackson 's films lobdell has examined tolkien 's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives one of the most interesting deals with the influence of edwardian adventure fiction haggard etc on tolkien another fascinating chapter deals with middle earth as a christian world in a age there is also a short fiction story in an appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to tolkien 's own abandoned sequel to the lord of the rings the return of the shadow i enjoyed this story though of course lobdell as a fiction writer can not measure up to tolkien but then no one can ! i am a long time tolkien reader and addict since the age of 12 in 1969 most of the time i do not care for tolkien criticism '' and literary analysis '' which to me seems to suck out the magic but lobdell 's work is different the world of the rings enhances middle earth and intensifies the love i feel for it

this is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened it does not deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse the author explicitly states this on many occasions and the reviewer who suggested that this is a terrific book if you are child molester '' probably i guess did n't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy the author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis repressed cults and rely on their intuition to unintentionally wreak havoc with their clients lives in the world of some therapists lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be the book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims
masterfully thought out written not your usual supernatural horror king story written in completely different chapters there is some supernatural but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood follows them through the years culminates with them as adults each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in at the end they are all tied together in some ways years later it 's ingenious in it 's finale and i advise you set aside some time for reading it 's very difficult to put down once it grabs your interest it just sucks you into the story if you remember your childhood friends we all do you 'll identify with the story
phyllis chesler is a most unusual feminist she really does n't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority gender feminist crowd the one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth this seems to be her most pervasive and endearing feature as an intellectual and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent death of feminism '' release here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text on the whole it makes for compelling reading we find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else they have many of the same yet subtlety different characteristics as do men in these pages chesler illustrates the magnitude of hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner many conflicts are projected into adult situations why feminists would n't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me we should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy chesler never implies any superiority or inferiority she is content to describe what is and it 's great stuff indeed
i have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec as they say with the cissp certification it is an inch deep and a mile wide '' this book covers many many topics however it is really intended to be an introduction to these concepts it gave me a good overview of information security concepts and prepared me for senior level infosec courses as well as preparation for graduate school that preparation for the cissp exam would require much more then just this book

raskolnikov an impovershed student in century petersburg conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker he justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse the world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes after all the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society the crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with raskolnikov 's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering almost every major character in the book is more likeable that raskolnikov the philosophy of dostoyevsky 's book seems to be primarily a refutation of hegelian and philosophy and an affirmation of christian values along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of having known prosecuted and defended hundreds of murderers i was much taken by raskolnikov 's psychological progression from crime to atonement much of his self justification rang true to my experience i have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth so long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized the killer can live with the deed when the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human guilt sets in and many confess often years later raskolnikov 's behavioural symptoms did not however ring true to my experience although some killers are to the point of distraction they can usually control themselves much better than raskolnikov his actions practically shouted his guilt the interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth but dostoyevsky did n't beat the reader over the head with the psychology he did n't tell you what the characters were thinking their actions showed you what they were thinking in my experience most modern ladle out the psychology in huge dollops modern writers would do well to dostoyevsky the abridged audio edition read by michael sheen is three hours long and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three cd 's my greatest complaint with the edition is that sheen reads the story with a british accent and the characters all speak with british accents it was somewhat hard to adjust to a russian novel read with a british accent
turning angel was a page turner for me so i bought blood memory wow ! it did not disappoint me
i had to read this book as an assignment for a seminary class on leadership i was sceptical that a children 's book about witches would be applicable to a master 's level college course my scepticism was unfounded this is a good fun read but more than that this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it 's characters i recommend it to children '' of all ages !
in faith in nation anthony marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the literary trope '' p 15 about a liberal inclusive western nationalism instead he argues that even the truest '' brand of western of england and to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale his entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today this leads one to question why does he insist on such a position has he made the case for it what happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong i will argue that the definition of the state or the lack thereof is key to answering all of the above questions only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state can marx trace the genesis of western nationalism back to as early as the century thus cementing the linkage between western nationalism and religious violence however the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts marx 's entire theory on shaky ground according to marx the state is the raison d'tat of nationalism for nationalism to become a historical force it must refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement '' p 8 although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is p 4 he never spells out his definition of a state in fact what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in century europe only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened can marx backdate nationalism to the century when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism can marx connect the religious violence of the century to nationalism only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building does it acquire significance in the nature of western nationalism otherwise the barthelme day massacre or the burnings at smithfield is just another normal '' religious upheavals in history thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely liah greenfeld implied when marx quoted her in saying frenchness was disassociating itself from catholicism '' to anthony marx however french nationalism and its french catholic identity are not external to each other they are just different stages in the same dialectic process therefore real frenchness '' is actually the public oblivion in france of the strange relationship between the church and the yet all the grand reasoning depends on marx 's definition of the state after all can we call the royal courts of the century states '' not only has marx not given his readers a clear answer some of his own writings seem to contradict each other for example marx mentions that the treaty of westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states p 35 but the french war of religions and the reign of mary very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of almost a century earlier even if we use the later date 1648 as the beginning of the state system one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities states '' regardless whether louis xiv actually said i am the state '' the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature relative to institutionalized modern government therefore it can hardly be designated the object of engagement '' for nationalist ideology since marx 's concept of the state is on shaky ground his entire theory appears highly questionable i would argue however there are two options that can salvage his arguments one is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state in other words nationalism may develop independent of the state this observation may have a wider application outside of the context of western history than inside of it the other option is to introduce a third element such as political culture that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times for example one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nevertheless the bloodshed molded a new political culture which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the took shape later if such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of marx then marx 's criticism of western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the western political liberal that it has a ugly past but short memory however is the world ready for such a total recall ''
tony judt 's postwar a history of europe since 1945 '' is the well researched material from a british conservative born 1948 in london and educated at cambridge and paris on political social and economic developments in europe following world war ii steeped in information about little understood countries the book would be a great read for interested in how the continent recovered from the war especially in east germany the balkans and the eastern europe countries that were strongly influenced by the ussr the book makes the point that without the threat of the ussr in eastern europe the us isolationist might have prevailed which would have adversely influenced the recovery of west germany and communism might not have collapsed so quickly although the book is relativly easy to read its 800 plus pages are peppered with little clauses that add about 200 unnecessary pages to the work nevertheless as historian i would rank the book slightly under 5 stars
as a pharmacy student i found the washington manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories this is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment this book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state but rather focuses on the causes measurements and treatments my only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics is considered old
this book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most citizens for so many years each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details names and places of the participants this book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand why they hate us '' i only regret that their is not a sequel

i took the 2 tom cover 's classes in information theory at stanford last year we used this book as the text for both classes the first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones this book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory tom 's classes were among the most enjoyable i took last year and i recommend this text to anyone interested in knowing about information theory if you just want to know the basics read through chapters the reader interested in understanding the power of information theory is adviced to read the whole book a final comment it is clear to me after my experience with tom 's classes that mastering information theory is a daunting task and in fact this book provides the interested researcher just with the basic knowledge needed to enter the field
i think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shot at the reader in the book but then at times that made the book more entertaining its acerbic opinion of the right how reagan getting elected made her feel stupid about being american a funny british couple the description of small details from each of the characters ' childhood was something i could relate to because i think of that myself there were clever tidbits from anthropology and economics and generally all fields of intellectual inquiry all somehow connected with the patchwork of love and relationships and thus brain meets heart and you end up with something almost like the bible for our times the focus on the main character made it so that every detail about him was described anyway i am rambling so a note about the ending i did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the book got towards the ending it might have made more sense if nelson actually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him and the story then comes full circle it would end in a nice ironic sort of way however his rejecting her makes in my mind for what would be a bad traditional ending i do n't mind this since the one time i wrote a story for a creative writing course i ended up with a terrible traditional ending now could he have been anything other than a mystic i felt that there was some hint towards hinduism and spirituality building up towards the end he mentioned india and hinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book so his becoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas and his transition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventually a sage as he attains nirvana and becomes the buddha of our times so in this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual is perhaps the best in line with the book the spiritual is the eternal and only accessible through experience what you do from making a model village in rural africa is transient can never be perfect infighting hunting guns the '' of human nature will come back even in utopia i like the flexible hours work when you want accumulate credits do manual labor once in a while start the day with reading not the end when you are tired siesta fiesta etc no matter how good you are the girl herself is secondary to the book ironic since the book promotes feminism is written by a guy with a female narrator but a male protagonist who she is fixated on and has doubts about but in the end the jesus character is still male while the female goes back to palo alto and takes an average job in service of the savior the man has the final laugh do you favor a better ending

in the last few decades historians following sociologists such as durkheim have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people 's experience of space and time schivelbusch 's small piece is a pretty good but example of this genre he reveals some interesting trivia along the way he tells for example how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed he shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting social values of europe and america but he is at his most interesting when describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations furthermore by creating the need for standardized railways nurtured a conception of time local idiocyncracies became less important doubtless true national identities could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and communications a book that takes these ideas much further is stephen kern 's excellent work the culture of time and space '' if this genre interests you kern 's book is an important read
this is my favorite of the series thus far without wanting to give too much away this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why roland is willing to give up anything and everything and clearly has just to get to the dark tower king mentions that the dark tower series is sort of like his where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world and you see what he means with this book fan 's of the stand will recognize signs of the super flu within the first few hundred pages and one of my all time favorite king villains comes back to pay his respects

hal zina bennett 's profound advice from his prolific writing career over 30 published books is write from the heart '' as wonderful as that sounds most writers know it 's not an easy thing to do hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader i can speak from my own personal experience having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book sacred woman sacred dance awakening spirituality through movement and ritual '' write from the heart '' also offers practical guidance in several areas this includes such things as the need for solitude however he is not just talking about having a quiet space '' he goes beyond the physical to the inner a state of mind he says once we know what it is what it looks like and feels like we can create it for ourselves almost i say almost '' regardless of where we happen to be '' i would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
in light of rev falwell 's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of 11 2001 i recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand why would that guy say that stuff '' harding presents an objective intelligent perceptive analysis of the way that fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world and how jerry falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active moral majority of the harding combs through falwell 's history and sermons to observe how the language of being born again '' affects the listener showing falwell 's shift from separatism to political activism she critiques both falwell and falwell 's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way good reading and good understanding

kurt vonnegut 's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself his unique style of black humor combined with his vivid imagination is second to none this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read ! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality is he or is he not crazy the imagery in this book was another great element and many regard this as one of the greatest books of the century this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint ! you ca n't go wrong with kurt vonnegut 's slaughterhouse five
first off this is a history of hollywood '' not the history of hollywood '' david thomson is n't writing the chronological account of hollywood movies the whole equation '' is an essay that takes as its question are hollywood films ever art like a beethoven symphony or a picasso painting '' he says they are both more and less than that more because american film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen that serendipity is wonderful when it works which is n't often less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits and unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension his argument is that to understand and appreciate american film you have to understand that it 's always about the money and about the art that means it is never truly art in any pure way but is any art truly pure to tell you the truth i do n't think the book succeeds that well on that level he points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of american film but he does n't developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight for me that just did n't matter what makes it a terrific read is that david thomson knows and loves film he writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic he uses the film chinatown '' as his framing device and as that is my favorite movie i was in heaven he is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater the audience the actors the costumes the music all of it he constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride
i read any way the wind blows not a day goes by before i read abide with me if you happen to come into the series of lynn 's books and want more of the scoop on basil 's problems with his past raymond 's lifestyle the true ' evil side of yancey and they 're mutual friends then you should start with this one ! it 'll help you put 'two two together ' on the lives and backgrounds of all of the characters
underground education '' does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective as is perhaps implied by the title but rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past some of the historical figures are famous such as george washington and cleopatra while others like the several female serial killers discussed are more obscure the book is divided into 10 chapters including the arts religion science and sex actually this book reminds me somewhat of the people 's almanac '' series written by david wallechinsky but here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse it 's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge but some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover still it is a worthwhile purchase

colonial fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology critiques of orientalism that isolate gender and culture and the western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm one of yegenoglu 's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process as desire frames the relation between the subject and its other yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation as a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest but simultaneously displaced 62 her argumentation is lucid and compelling for the colonial gaze the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire in the fantasy of unveiling as well as the because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project the veil therefore frustrates the process of the positioning in colonialist discourse the subject can not quite see the object and its subjectivity thus remains in question interestingly this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by western feminism as the veil has come to signify the backwardness of islam and its inherent oppression of women the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference in this dynamic the identity of the liberated western woman is constructed vis vis the oppressed muslim woman 102 since the status of western women is contingent on the continued representation of muslim women as oppressed yegenoglu reveals that the western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded enlightenment ideology she argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments 115 this facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles in sum yegenoglu 's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among theorists
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row '' at least in the state of mississippi and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row '' the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain i found it to be one of the better john grisham books

quite often we read books for young people where the main characters must lean to care for others and not just the main character must break away from childhood egocentrism and emerge into the adult world in katherine paterson 's lyddie readers find the opposite theme learning to not lose oneself in the responsibilities of the adult world the novel follows lydia worthen a teenager in vermont with her father gone to seek his fortune lyddie with some help from her brother charlie must take charge of the family farm her emotionally unstable mother and her younger sisters to cover the farm debt lyddie 's mother leases the farm and sends her oldest children into forced servitude after a year of misery working for a local tavern lyddie becomes a mill hand in lowell massachusetts while there lyddie 's sole focus becomes earning the money to pay off the farm debt and reunite her family her hard work and earn her a reputation as a skinflint '' and amazon '' it 's only after the farm is sold her youngest sister dies her mother is sent to the asylum her remaining siblings are adopted by another family and her job is lost over fraudulent charges that lyddie begins to look out for she begins to ask what she wants for herself while lyddie is not paterson 's best work the book does provide lively insight to factory life in lowell where many young women flocked in the early for economic opportunity while readers are not thrown into the heart of the labor movement we are able to see the conditions that led to organized labor the long hours the sexual harassment the illness and disease resulting from mill work still all of this background provides a fitting setting for the story of a young woman who must learn that she has more to offer the world than her labor if you 've enjoyed paterson 's other works of historical fiction lyddie will not disappoint

fabulously entertaining novel from martin amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing ' john self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials he is an alcoholic a misogynist and a microcosm of mainstream american culture in the 1980 's john has also landed a gig directing a feature film titled money ' and money ' depending on what day of the week it is amis ' writing is mordantly brilliant both acerbic and biting there are transactions in here that i just love such as john 's stinging interactions with his girlfriend selina '' 've just gone off sex ' said selina this morning as she finished the tea i fondly brought her ' i asked her be nice use your imagination it 'll pass i 've just gone off sex ' then what do you think is the point of you i wanted to say but i did n't i resisted the temptation i looked into the proud drama of her face the valves and orbits of her throat the wetlook runnels of her hair the breasts heavier than ever solidly mounted on the ribcage the naked slopes of the belly the sudden flaring of the hips a smell of sleep what do you think is the point of you ' ' she said unreal ' 226 you should read amis for his remarkable power of description his talent for black comedy and disillusionment pay little heed to his flights into they are merely exercises in literary chic

i think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously as political thrillers go this is one of the best of the genre it 's packed with insider information from politicians and the amoral who advise them to assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the fbi granted the premise is implausible a group of former seals assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the seals believe have sold the country down the river or in the southern vernacular because they needed killin ' '' while one can argue whether the seals have the high moral ground in this setting it does n't detract from the action like a thrill ride at disneyland this book should not be examined too critically just get in hold on close your eyes and enjoy the ride
i ca n't say enough about this wonderful book it 's packed full of examples covers more than just the and placement aspects and is incredibly there 's so much information here more than i expected it really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption it 's for both birth and adoptive parents in fact two of the birth parents we 've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption i 'm so glad it was recommended to us if you 're thinking about adoption even if you 're thinking that open adoption is n't right for you i highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book it 's great

design is a difficult process that is often associated more with art than science with principles of style concerns about how design works while many wring their hands about this alexander breaks the problem down organizes it and then provides a framework for design that is relatively design neutral that is a feat in deed by thinking about how one structures a problem space and the bias that creates alexander give the practioner a powerful tool for setting up the design process and scope he then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design notes on synthesis and form are the foundation for alexander 's work on design patterns this is the must read book before spending time on these other works for the practioner this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines
another great story stephen king is not typical in this book the development of the characters is awesome you felt everything that dolores was going through and you know you would have done the same thing you route for her she is spunky bitter but she means business great book i highly recommend this book i read it in about 6 hours
i bought the book the other day and breezed right thru it it 's great in that you can skip around the book to the sections you need to read or refresh yourself on i keep it handy because i often refer to it it is thorough in explaining various aspects of reading music playing etc the humor interspersed makes it enjoyable to read rather than boring but the humor does n't detract from the content and lesson glad i bought it and you should buy it too if you want to teach yourself how to play
the waste lands the third novel in stephen king 's the dark tower series is by far the best volume yet this volume picks up a short time after the end of drawing of the three and we see roland training eddie and susannah to become true gunslingers in roland 's world soon into the novel the three gunslingers encounter one the guardians of a huge cyborg bear who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the dark tower by a beam and if they follow the beam it will lead them directly to the dark tower they just do n't know how far away it is as the three gunslingers start to follow the beam we the readers are taken to our own world and reintroduced to jake the child from the gunslinger jake is currently having a mental breakdown as is roland due to the fact that roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a cadillac in the drawing of the three one part of jake tells him he should be dead the other says he should be alive jake 's mental breakdown leads him on a journey across new york to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book and in this house jake believes he can get back to and be reunited with roland the final part of the journey in the waste lands takes our group to a city called lud on the outskirts of the waste lands the group believes they need to find a monorail named blaine in the city and he will help them on their journey to the dark tower once they enter the city much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool but really evil character called the man who runs lud all of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad i waited to read these until they were all published as far as action and suspense goes the waste lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books most of all this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books we care so much about these characters and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them this book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the dark tower in general and these answers are both satisfying and frustrating they are satisfying that you are n't completely clueless as to what is going on but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel so it just makes you want to read on more the series just keeps getting better as it goes along
edward gorey uses gothic illustrations to tell the tale of a strange creature who appears one day in a family 's home the prose is an amusing rhyme which describes the family 's confusion and frustration at dealing with this unwanted guest although the illustrations are gothic and dark the reader is still amused by the creature and the family who must deal with it
first off i have to admit i am 22 years old and read the entirety of this book in one 7 hour sitting on my way to paris i picked up the novel out of sheer curiosity and personal research for my job i work at barnes noble and am in charge of both the teen and children 's sections when our store sold out of new moon within a week of initially getting the book my curiosity was piqued i felt i had to give its predecessor a try so i knew what the hype was about and could give an honest opinion about the book now here i sit and i have finished both twilight and new moon i have to admit meyer has a talent both books i read at breakneck speed barely stopping to eat or sleep her prose is smooth and easy accompanied by a plot that i found engrossing i went back after reading twilight and my favorite sections more than once the love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive i definitely plan on recommend this book mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over edward however i only gave the book four stars while i enjoyed it immensley as i read the novel a few things bothered me upon looking back 1 while meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy if i had to read one more time about edward 's marble angelic face what exactly does that mean his liquid topaz eyes or how bella glared at edward i thought i was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane 2 i 'm not sure i buy their romance it was heartstopping and climactic during the read but honestly what does he see in her if bella keeps asking that question to herself maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it 3 bella herself bothered me i found bella to be horribly dependent on edward to the point that i got irritated with her and her constantly having to catch her breath around edward be a woman ! stand on your own feet ! she never fully developed into a character for me since she revolved solely around edward something that i as a woman can not connect with and lastly 4 bella wants so desperately to become a vampire but that seems like it could pose a problem between herself and edward since i have n't seen any evidence that edward likes bella for any other reason than that she smells wonderful a scent that she has because she is human and has blood coursing through her veins mind you what happens when she no longer smells good meyer is really going to have to prove to me that edward actually loves bella for other reasons than her smell otherwise it will be completely unbelievable if bella turns into a vampire and edward is still attracted to this ordinary girl although the plot has its shortcomings i still thoroughly enjoyed it and that is why i give it four stars i will read the next one when it comes out and any other subsequent after that for the simple reason that the books are entertaining and edward is so dang alluring
boston is trembling under the shadow of a serial murderer with a notably gruesome method of dispatching his victims brutal savage rape an obviously knowledgeable skillful removal of the uterus while the victim still lives with the coup de grace coming as a slashed throat and severing of the carotid artery ! little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker the surgeon '' in the course of their investigations detectives thomas moore and jane rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical mo in savannah in which the murderer andrew capra was ultimately killed by a stalwart victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job ! they are startled to discover that the surviving victim dr catherine cordell is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major boston hospital and beyond all belief in the possibility of coincidences she appears to be the target of the now active killer ! once again gerritsen has unerringly brought her intimate knowledge of medicine and the hospital milieu to the table but contrary to what one might fairly expect from gerritsen 's past work has successfully served up a compelling investigative police procedural which lovingly details the forensics the pathology the profiling and the detail in the relentless task force style search for a psychopathic serial murderer ! several superbly paced are inextricably woven into one another as the story unfolds cordell 's slow recovery from the assault she endured two years ago and her halting into life and the hospital work force jane rizzoli 's bristly temperament as the lone boston female homicide detective and her struggles against the old boy '' attitude of the police force thomas moore 's extended grieving period over the untimely loss of his dearly loved wife and the difficulties he faces as he recognizes his entirely inappropriate blossoming romantic feelings for catherine cordell the task force style investigation of the surgeon '' and his relationship with the long dead georgia killer and cordell 's daily life in the cardiac ward and the emergency room of the hospital and the brilliantly described relationship she maintains with her working partner dr peter falco not only does gerritsen handle all of this with skill and aplomb but with every passing page and each successful murder she ratchets up the suspense as we realize the killer is taunting the police honing his skills and reaching for catherine cordell as his ultimate target yet he constantly remains one step ahead of the investigation a great addition to the library if like me you love your easy reading thrillers ! paul weis
engrossing and amusing travelogue by world 's crankiest traveler some people really hate theroux accusing him of snobbery self importance and bigotry i can certainly see why some readers would n't be able to deal with his style and opinions but i must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers ' tolerance for the author 's travel works if you can enjoy this one you 'll probably enjoy his other works i for one totally enjoyed hearing about towns obnoxious holiday camps and seedy hotels to me the book was a real and he writes so vividly of scenery i felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor reminding us travelers that it 's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times i felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island 's shoreline and i now know what to avoid there i can definitely thank theroux and his fussy standards ! if you like theroux it 's a good bet you 'll love this one
my father was a chef and although we did not have much money i was brought up appreciating good fresh healthy food as well as cookbooks my father had a library of cookbooks gastronomic dictionaries even cookbooks in french he was trained by a french chef in the 1950 's with that being said i am obsessed with eating and occasionally cooking good food this cookbook is the one i use over and over again i have cooked almost every recipe in the book more than once which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook the beauty of it is that is is simple most ingredients are things you would have most recipes are for the novice cook but can be challenging enough for a true obsessed gourmet the other aspect is that he balances flavors and spices perfectly nothing is too overly spiced heavy etc when i cook for guests i use this cookbook because it is manageable but makes me look like a genius people always say to me this tastes better than restaurant food ! '' get the hardback version it will last longer and make you feel like a true cook as we all can be

i 'm glad i bought this book and i will continue to refer to it the remit of the dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss the text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science in this respect it would have been a difficult book to author readers having come from one discipline or the other i agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree bioinformatics is a new field and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler
i wo n't spoil the ending but some many other reviewers did n't like the twist however the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100 happy should read runaway jury however like the firm another great book that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble this book has a very realistic ending that you did n't expect this was my favorite grisham book followed by the firm runaway jury and pelican brief i found the broker to be too much of an italian lesson the brethern simplistic and the street lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people with very little story holding it together if you like the firm you will like the partner
here is the disclaimer i was already a proponent of tort reform before i read this book however after reading this novel i am a stronger proponent of it than ever enter clay carter unknown defender in of the poorest of the poor then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap one he ca n't refuse partly because the parent 's of his girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money give carter a taste of money then the greed sets in for the middle half of the book we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life ! especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the of his clients this is what will be his undoing one of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer this is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater clay carter through his rise and especially his fall that shows to the quality of his storytelling in fact while carter is in some ways a sympathetic character he mostly is not ! mass torts and greed is the theme of this story the fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice too bad such justice does n't often happen in the real world of mass torts
this book is rather different although it 's about copernicus ' book de revolutionibus '' very little astronomy is discussed there is also very little about copernicus himself the main theme of the book is finding as many copies of copernicus ' book as possible and describing each one in detail the ultimate purpose being the publication of a census '' of that ancient book a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world since i know nothing about antique book collecting i learned a lot on this field by reading this book i was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book especially identifying the authors of any notes on its pages i did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous but some of the author 's adventures are quite intriguing particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book as well as discussions of some of copernicus ' contemporaries are touched upon but as the author states this book is really a memoir of his census project i think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting
like pretty much anything in which neil 's involved this a fine and useful work the reviews of teddy millon 's axis ii taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves but after 30 years in the field i 'll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you 're treating as with notions about starting points and signposts along the way however these are very useful neil 's treatment outline seems a bit oddly ordered and i was n't able to find a rationale for determining diagnosis in the final step when you have to lay one on the client 's payment guarantor at the outset but otherwise the six steps are another handy construction among several now available if you 're fairly new in the field this will be a real handy reference but do n't stake the clients ' lives or your own serenity on this when they start to go refractive
diane ravitch discusses the development of censorship in textbooks and on tests that has been slowly integrated into the educational system she speaks about the rights of the first amendment pertaining to free speech and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed the book is informative and provoking ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and can not be said in certain literature for education she goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used this list is ridiculous and completely irrational due to left and right wing intervention almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests she goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met she argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions ravitch presents a good convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views to the best of my knowledge and research she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews feminists minorities and other groups her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies occasionally ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies although she has clear concise points ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters which is slightly confusing her claims are logically consistent and her argument seems complete with all the relevant evidence presented throughout research ravitch manages to also find publishing companies who have tried to change standards and incorporate more accurate facts in textbooks and what happens to these companies when they go against the bias and sensitivity rules the argument ravitch presents is a historically accurate account of censorship in textbooks fairly and effectively arguing her point today more and more people are beginning to notice what is going on with censorship in textbooks and are speaking up and taking steps toward removing these censors textbooks are becoming more accurate and classic literature reintroduced to the classroom ravitch calls for the dispersion of the language police '' and a return to the freedom of speech '' that everyone has the right to exercise

i consider myself an optimist and insightful person but somehow managed to miss many of postrel 's insights she gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than i previously thought she does keep that hope in check though by talking about the enemies of the primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat instead of the blessing that it is she thoroughly destroys the notion that 'there is nothing new under that sun ' while the universe therefore our earth is necessarily finite we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in for example a deck of cards has only 52 cards but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe ! so whenever you shuffle a deck of cards you can rest assured that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence ever people are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things obviously there will always be new things every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history science technology etc it 's safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about we need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can it will only make our lives better on the whole there will always be setbacks but as long as people can think we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks the book is a stunning intelligent look at modern life i liked it so much i bought the substance of style which is yet another insightful look at modern life
after seeing the movie i decided to pick up the book this book proved to be very funny as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many many women her age face today fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true often serious topics being single and not liking it infidelity betrayal and is yet able turn it into light funny reading that takes talent in my book in the wrong hands this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read in light of the above topics you cant help but root for bridget i recommend this book and its sequel most everyone will get a good laugh out of it
much of the book 's material is not restricted to educational research it is generally applicable to anyone who wants to perform experimental studies in the social sciences where you need to deal with human subjects granted in the book these subjects are often primary school kids but the guidelines given in such matters as the general steps for qualitative research data collection and data analysis are quite general likewise further in the book when it discusses quantitative research the book 's discussion of statistics is necessarily abbreviated directed at a reader unfamiliar with chi square tests and the like but still easily understood
mccain et al write very well and i was impressed by his style the writing was not the only style with which i became familiar but the style '' of the man himself john mccain this was a truthful revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft profession we can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father i believe this read is one to add to one 's readings of autobiographies biographies
this book is about yoga for the heart which is rare in our body sculpting culture yet paradoxically heart diseases are one of the greatest risk factors for our modern health a simple profound gift of yoga is the recognition that the body is the temple for the indwelling spirit realizing this simple truth profoundly affects our relationship to the body through the author 's lifetime committment to the teachings of yoga we glimpse the relevance of the yogic lifestyle this book serves as a guide in making healthier choices in everyday life by walking for awhile with nischala we touch a deeper realization of the unity that yoga brings i recommend this book to any yoga practitioner teacher as well as anyone who seeks greater peace of mind and physical
this is what happens when uneducated reactionaries dictate to a concept that is beyond their comprehension it 's just more sanke oil from the same pigs who gave us the scams of deregulation capitalism governing itself privatization the giveaway of what our taxes bought to those who pay little or no tax and globalization repositioning the republican party to a time predating the emancipation proclamation hitler and mussolini would certainly approve
i first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990 's it aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion like many a cynic i asked myself now who 's this guy and what 's he spinning '' against my natural inclination to dismiss it i ordered pog on receiving it i began reading and found my suspicions confirmed here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of god strangely however i could n't stop reading despite months of scrawling angry in the margins of its pages i was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about god 's delight in being god to make this story short i found myself in the end exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of god that piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth and finally happy too with the beginnings of the joy piper wished for his sons in the foreword salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated at first the fact that pog eventually had such an unnatural or supernatural effect on someone like me initially so inclined to resist and rebuff speaks more to the validity of this book than if i had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration this is not a critical analysis of pog others have provided that sufficiently on this page instead it 's a personal account of the irresistible grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where god 's glory was seen and is now sung

i felt this book was reasonably priced and offered a wide array of helpful fundraising advice especially for the small to nonprofit it covers a lot of the basics in a writing style that is pleasant to read
this is the sort of book i have been looking for a long time i 've read other books on the middle east which purport to have a similar focus but which are instead incomplete notably sowing the wind '' this book by contrast maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region it looks as if the book was written as a textbook for i would presume grad students studying the subject but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal an issue with a book like this is the tone of the work how well the author writes kamrava is n't the second coming of hemingway but he 's not too bad either the book is divided into two portions first a historical section that gives you an overview of the region 's history and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently the first section is very readable the second less so who actually enjoys reading about economics the author however does a good job for the most part of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something though he does occasionally use words that are obscure especially in terms of of the mid east i still enjoyed this book thought i got a lot out of it and would recommend it the author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than i am but he makes a good case for his point of view and the result is interesting
whether you are new to dating widowed or divorced and starting to date again or in your year of marriage you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way ideally you could read this book before you embark upon the dating chapter '' of your life but even if you 're not new to dating this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways it can increase your chances of finding the right person reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone emotionally during the dating process and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom otherwise you could end up having a wonderful relationship i especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship or who are thinking that they thought they were '' with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden if you are questioning things like where did he go why did n't he call why does he seem so distant now what did i do wrong you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere and likewise i recommend this to men who feel that they 've come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden are n't sure '' anymore are feeling anxious or maybe even trapped '' and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure worries more questions you more starts pressuring you more about commitment etc all of these situations emotions etc are explained in this book you 're not the only one it 's a normal part of dating but unfortunately most of us wo n't possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us like gray has done in this book even if you are married this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your if you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends family children when they come to you for advice
i came into this book expecting one thing after the first part perhaps an accident my expectations had completely altered as i read through the second part marquesa de montemeyor my expectations were slowly changing even more by the beginning of the third part esteban my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable i came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion 's struggle with faith by the first few pages i came to realize it had much more of a lean at this point i was scared of being bored as i started to read part two i began to realize it was n't about this brother juniper at all but the people in the accident throughout parts of the first chapter i have to admit i did feel bored but near the end it caught fire and i was wowed by the first part 's finish this reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it for that 's what each part was a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge the story of thornton wilder 's pulitzer prize winner is that a bridge the finest bridge in all of peru snapped and five travelers fell to their death brother jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was god 's will this man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life i would say the way the bridge of san luis rey was written was generally not exceptionally appealing to me it was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events using this method though there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry the book also seemed slightly tedious at times certain sections were difficult to get through but as i pressed on i felt a certain gratification in knowing that i was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get despite these downfalls which had their upshots as well the meaning of the book made it for me the characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death which was a death too early for all of them there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments in total i would suggest the bridge of san luis rey but only if you 're willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up it can be a beautiful book but only if first acknowledged as a tough book
another great book as usual ! too bad there are n't more books like her 's do n't we all wish we lived in mitford ! great bible quotes great friendships and a little love splashed in somewhere
antonia fraser has written a wonderful account of marie antoinette and the court of versailles that makes you feel you are living at the time a detailed yet understandable explanation of the political and royal intrigues of the time both in france and in europe that lead to the revolution
the boom dent speaks of has is starting in the population centers of the far east and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in america the boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers since so many of our companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations they are using that in order to finance the implementation of the net effect is that is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of companies this is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws so the industries that will expand will primarily focus around 1. baby boomer spending 2. competitive advantage exports
this book was not your usual biography where it lulls at certain points the entire book was an enjoyable read it covers his life from beginning to end and focuses on his character
i found 10 at a garage sale and thought i better just start at 1. i have buzzed through to 12 and through out them all i have found myself laughing out loud
fuller offers an insightful blend of battlefield detail and the broader causes and effects for each engagement presented he avoids one of the major shortcomings i have with a lot of other military history authors bogging the reader down in pedantic minutiae
i purchased weber 's art of the grill at the same time as weber 's big book of grilling i feel that with this book they went for a more upscale level of grilling which is fine i would recommend this book to anyone new to grilling or an old pro it is well layed out and the pictures are of high quality as in the other weber cookbooks the format is easy to use and well thought out if you are looking for a more beginner '' weber grilling book check out weber 's big book of grilling you ca n't go wrong with it i was glad i purchased both
you probably know joel siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on good morning america but do you know the rest of the story here 's a chance to find out siegel became a father for the first time at age 54 and his son dylan was born on the day siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer that cancer later spread to his lungs and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed siegel 's marriage did not last but his love for dylan did realizing that his chances of living to see dylan grow up are limited siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with dylan over the next few decades but might not be able to the result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating siegel 's love for his son siegel writes well has had many interesting experiences and retains his sense of wonder he is open about many of his faults which have led to failed marriages but remains cautiously optimistic and careful dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that i have read anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book if you are like me you expected to mainly hear about the movies and you will but there 's much more in the book about siegel 's family jewish heritage there 's even a yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions illnesses past marriages and advice for dylan the show business stories are almost all ones that i had not heard before and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature although you might think these are only about the movies he also was a music critic and got to know the beatles in the early days i was particularly interested by siegel 's accounts of working for civil rights in the south helping with bobbie kennedy 's campaign and how he helped his wife jane with her fatal illness one of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations i hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way or to create the book you want to share with your descendants in any case keep a hanky handy !
how does she do it this will forever be one of my favorite books reading about the astoundingly crazy life mary karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless nor did i feel that she was in a hopeless situation it always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found a profoundly inspiring book i only hope i can be as resourceful and resilient
wilson does n't spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees he tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life you get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire it 's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds when he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow it 's amazing that wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred but maybe even more amazing that he does n't embellish the situations there is little reflection on an event because he 's off describing the next firefight or lost buddy the most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field it was not only unfair but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting did n't know the difference the title refers to a commander who told wilson before he went into battle that he 'd be promoted if he survived the promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he does n't seem that upset about his treatment it turned out to be the experience of his life
my hat 's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review it is beyond anything i 've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines unlike the embedded journalists of our own time the writers and photographers who covered vietnam were much closer to being free agents restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of america 's military presence in southeast asia there it is while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience depicting the war as a phantasmagoria a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour to read this book is to experience vietnam not as a historical record or analysis or even a personal memoir but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many including survivors never wake
in 2003 i suffered my worst major depression ever it lasted for over a year and in the worst moments lasted my anguish was so intense that i wished i were dead again the worst part was when i could n't even get a full night 's rest and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 full of despair unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching having to get up in the morning was hell needless to say i could n't work and that increased my and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four we have two adolescent kids reading andrew solomon 's book which i found recommended at at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience because for the first time ever i found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression in my illness i found that psychiatrists doctors and other therapists who have n't themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply can not understand what it is like it 's just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes the other person will have no real understanding unless eats one same with friends and of many sorts who will tell you things like cheer up ! '' or make an effort ! '' without realizing that that 's precisely what you would most want to do ca n't solomon 's book and the advise of mike a friend and the guy who created the at blogspot dot have been of great value to me and of course the courage and love of my wife who never in the worst moments when we both thought i might die at any abandoned hope sustaining me putting up with a lot holding me when i cried in utmost despair and wished i were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now i recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to and my kids too who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage and god who in the midst of utter darkness and despair was there too and saw me through
when considering the faith of the founders of the it is easy to rely on and assumptions david holmes dispels a lot of myths in his book which uses historical documentation personal letters and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused he begins by describing the religious movements of the century which influenced our founders one interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had churches a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation although many of the people he describes including george washington benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson were brought up in orthodox christian churches such as episcopal and congregational they were later influenced by the deist movement which opposed many orthodox christian views he describes some interesting practices such as the fact that george washington would leave anglican services before participating in communion despite the fact that his wife martha would stay for the sacrament this is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the deist leanings of her husband holmes concludes his book with a brief description of presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers ' did in writing this book holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian and which makes it all the more believable
this volume contains entries that deal with concepts events persons and movements in history the length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered in addition the entires both inform the reader with information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline the entries are clearly written and eminently readable they are persuasive in thier opionions yet respectful of other stances the cross references are helpful and ample the same obtains for the bibliographies the oxford companion to history far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in history its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances the entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial i would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research
eric carle 's illustrations are beautiful and unusual the simply stated story is appropriate for the very young to children the author incorporates math and science in a book you will wish to read again and again the story was a favorite for the children ages two to five at the local library 's story hour and it was a favorite of mine to read to them
as a follower of christ '' christian who considers himself an evangelical protestant this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart for all christian believers the richness and power of brother lawrence 's life 's witness and words are a fountain of truth a treasure that is as elegant spiritually as it is simple for the i am afraid that reading this booklet a spiritual treasure in disguise will just confirm paul the apostles 's words that the message of the cross is foolishness to the gentiles '' 1 corinthians 23 and the only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it this is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the brother lawrence of the resurrection birth name nicholas herman but known by his monastic name but by the ones around his life in century france thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss presence of god in his heart and suffering 3 physical and debilitating ailments we learn about this vessel in god 's vineyard brother lawrence by reading the eulogy of the abbot of lawrence 's christian community 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father abb de beaufort 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement brother lawrence wrote to friends and seekers a manuscript found at his death called spiritual maxims '' and a memoir of a leader in the church in france the followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book '' busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the lord '' my most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on god and to be generally and lovingly aware of him '' i occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on god and by being generally and lovingly aware of him '' we have an infinitely good god who knows what we need '' console yourself with the one who keeps you fastened to the cross '' we should love our friends but without prejudicing the love of god which must be first '' think often about him worship him without ceasing life and die with him this is the beautiful call in the life of a christian '' we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples '' our only business in this life is to please god my little progress in the path of perfection '' i applied myself to practicing the presence of god doing this gave me such a high esteem for god that faith alone was capable of satisfying me '' a devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear increases through the hope of eternal life and is consumated by pure love '' my prayer may we all experience god 's love which truly can consume all other passions and be filled with his grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors christian and as ourselves this is my life goal
i love this cookbook use it all the time ! my daughter has many allergies tree nuts included so we have n't been able to use all the recipes but those that we have are wonderful ! i keep checking back hoping to see another book by this author but have n't found any so far as for the rantings '' spoken about in another review read the book cover to cover and did n't find anything that fits that description i enjoyed meyer 's stories of her children and her 'journey ' and appreciate her having shared it thanks
it 's pretty impressive to think that a book like hiroshima '' was written and appreciated less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped john hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the atomic age interviewing six survivors hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not the color of your clothing means everything white clothes reflect the heat while dark clothing absorbs it even if you survive the initial blast what you see next might make you wish you had n't but human beings are stubborn creatures and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances i have been to the hiroshima peace park several times and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal it is a humbling experience and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes hersey 's book has a similar impact being told in such a clinical observational writing style that you ca n't help but be moved by the reality of it all my one criticism of hiroshima '' is the cast of characters that hersey chose to showcase for some reason they seem to be largely christian including a german jesuit priest and a japanese methodist minister with christians being such a tiny percentage of the japanese population considerably less than 1 the choice to interview japanese christians seems a deliberate one hersey is telling the us readers see they are n't heathen devils they are christians just like you and me that 's who we dropped the bomb on that 's who we killed '' this puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book and has hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was
working in an it company catering to bankers i bought this book to help understand their lingo i have to say it has n't disappointed yet it is also very up to date the latest terms if you were to read all the definitions in this book you would probably know more than you banker a great reference buy it
i disagree with the reviewer who said that this book does not offer solutions again and again the author reports that people need to be heard and need to stop repressing emotions to get well as a counselor working with battered women i was amazed at the number of them who also had disorders such as fibromyalgia this book is a must read
i will probably write a few papers while getting a master 's degree and i think for my limited use apa the easy way '' is the right product for me i agree with other reviewers that if you do a lot of writing in the apa style you may need the complete manual however i have the complete manual and since i bought apa the easy way '' i do n't think i will ever need to use the manual again i especially like that it gives instructions on how to do all of the '' for
this item is a for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the church of jesus christ of saints lds or mormons for short while not an authentic artifact it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of america 's most successful and controversial movements of the and centuries this reproduction allows the reader to read the original century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of joseph smith author and proprietor to the pen s of his various scribes when the book is placed in it 's historical context the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current lds church as well as smith 's answers for many of the religious concerns of his day also interestingly when compared to the current version of the book and the lds church today the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time for example the development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity see book of 1 nephi and mosiah also see lectures on faith also by smith to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses see current version of the book of mormon changing of the text in 1 nephi to correspond with current church doctrine the original condemnation of polygamy marriage to more than one wife at a time with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity see book of jacob to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late century for no reason other than smith saying that god commanded the practice then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent church property from being confiscated and to allow utah statehood in the union the condemnation of secret clandestine societies see book of helaman 3 nephi ether to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy loyalty and revenge for the murder of smith in the nauvoo temple endowment the original condemnation and futility of baptism for children and those that die without the law see book of mormon name of a section within the book to the practice of performing all church ordinances including baptism vicariously for the dead those that died without the law like all movements the lds church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members the importance of this book for any follower of the religion or student of sociology history etc is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it 's metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market for that reason alone the book receives 5 stars

i am informally studying cormac having read his last works first namely no place for old men '' preceeded by the trilogy '' and blood meridian '' his precise knowledge about the area and customs of his story and the minimilist language which he develops in the later novels is interesting to watch grow
having read all of mccarthy 's other books already i came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content and i was not disappointed mccarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters the vivid description of the mountains the people and their culture puts the reader right there in the story these harsh terse and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long long time i found this story a little more abstract than most of mccarthy 's other works yet i was able to see his message in the end required reading for any mccarthy fan
i bought this book along with saving dinner and saving dinner for the holidays last year i love the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping we went through the entire book and i have to say it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods also the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance what 's for dinner '' and be ready to prepare it the only cons i can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly and you will need to be an open minded eater if you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household this may not be the book for you also our grocery bill for two went up from about 75 a week to 125 because of the veggies and meats good healthy quality food ingredients but unfortunately painful to the wallet that said i have never seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one the food is good the variety is there and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond bunless burgers '' and eggs and bacon overall i would recommend leanne 's saving dinner books for the open minded foodie or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list these books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress
so here is a collection of essays by jonathan franzen the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001 the corrections many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as harper 's and the new yorker so readers should know what they 're getting into i read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of franzen as a corporeal human being and not just some exalted author of an novel overall i liked most of the essays appearing in this collection from the promising opener in which franzen poignantly recounts his father 's slow descension into quietus from alzheimer 's we progress to a pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in america before ashcroft and the patriot act invaded the american lexicon why bother which was previously referred to as the harper 's essay is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the century as a tool of social reform the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform but should rather be written ultimately for plain old entertainment value franzen seems to argue some of these essays seem to be a little discursive franzen evidentally has a lot to say and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are going off on long tangents such as in difficult where as some other reviewer stated he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be pretentious '' but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author william gaddis franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary without pontificating or being too offensively forward people may consider franzen an elitist '' but i consider him to posses a inquisitive mind there are far too few jonathan franzens around these days
i would first like to start by saying that the picture of dorian gray is by far one on my favorite novels and were i not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel i would have given it 5 stars without a doubt it is a fabulous story i would recommend it to anyone as a small sidenote i would simply like to say that wilde 's particular style of writing is one which i do in general find rather enjoyable i have heard some people say that they found this book diffucult to muddle through i was not one of these people also the other stories in this book are not bad at all i enjoyed the happy prince quite thoroughly this particular fairy tale '' was very reminiscent of hans christian anderson 's writings the flaw s ! i blame the editor for this one this book as far as i have been able to find does not include the alternate slightly more ending to this novel i was needless to say a little upset by this missing detail if i have merely overlooked this extended ending by all means let me know another small flaw if you have not read the book do not i repeat do not begin by reading the authors note although the authors note was very insightful and generally enjoyable to read it easily gives away more than half the plot the authors note is a spoiler beware overall still a great novel not so happy with the editor
i used this book for an introductory lesson on descriptive cataloguing in library archival and information science it worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach a lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way there are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding
ironically socialist iconoclastic professor taylor could be at least in this work the inspiration for the great david irving 's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war it is demonstrated that adolph hitler the popular nationalist german leader was no more responsible and in many ways less so than the allies who foolishly guaranteed poland only to give her over to jewish bolshevism at yalta by refusing to grant germany 's rightful place as a continental power britain and france lost millions of lives their world empires and their economic prominence the sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the soviets and their western fellow travellers and upon the final dissolution of the evil empire courtesy of one dutch reagan we have a european continent completely dominated by germany
in a sea of books from career counselors '' corcodilos has advice from a true insider instead of the usual corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo one hears a lot of complaints from hiring managers that effective qualified employees are in short supply however corcodilos lays bare the true cause of this corporate angst the present recruiting system is broken ask the headhunter is worthwhile reading for both the candidate and the hiring manager two agents who are in desperate need to meet
i loved this story it was enriched with so many lessons emotions and detail that you felt like you were right there with lous and oz i would recommend this story to any one ! !
i really enjoyed this book it took me a while to read it about 2 months because it 's definitely not fast paced i was glad i had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand darcy is pride '' and elizabeth bennett is prejudice '' these two are made for each other unbeknown to themselves this is essentially the story of how they fall in love with lots of twists and turns i really like darcy he is the perfect gentleman he is readily willing to admit his own faults when they are brought to his knowledge he also does n't retaliate when rejected by elizabeth and accused of things he did n't do or that are misunderstood elizabeth is also wonderful she is doubtful about people and quite cynical i really like that about her it makes for some great banter between darcy and herself my favorite part of the book is when elizabeth see darcy at pemberly this is where i think she begins to fall in love with him pemberly is where he is at where is is truly himself i would probably be charmed by him too ! this book took a little commitment to get through but once i got into it i could n't wait to see what happened next even though i already knew the story i recommend it to anyone who enjoys regency england
i liked track of the cat but i did n't love it the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing but the plot was at times predictable the setting was but most of the characters were pretty the clincher though is that i 'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character i believe that this is her first story so i do n't want to make a snap judgement but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple that would be expecting a lot i know but frankly she is n't even as engaging as say gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch as i said the jury is still out for me here i liked track of the cat but i was n't wild about it it 's a solid first try and i 'll certainly read another anna pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series i expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable i recommend it but my recommendation is a mild one
exposure to harv eker 's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago i also attended the guerilla business school a 2500 intensive what is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually as it did with me shift your perspective if you are at all open to having it shifted getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones this book may help you but the seminar will help you more the millionaire mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me i am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called zerodollarmarketer dot com being rich is a matter of perspective true wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind my relationships and lastly my pocketbook but its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month a journey worth pursuing
this is one of my favorite books of all time and during my 40 years of life i 've read a lot of them first off the style is simple and direct no big words and no long sentences but this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated as the product of a year old mind it impresses it reads very much like a modern novel this is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself at any age let alone 19 or 20. as such it is remarkable secondly the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught educated people should know how easy it is to become a hypocrite when how one behaves is determined solely by how he believes the public will react matthew lewis was not concerned about this this is what makes him such a great writer too many contemporary authors are more motivated to write what they believe the public will like than what is in their hearts lewis ' book created a sensation when it was published he probably realized that he was writing a controversial book but he believed strongly that what he had to say was the truth and that it should be said after all he was writing during the french revolution while the reign of terror was raging in paris people were just beginning to become disillusioned with reason because of what they felt it had led to in france but had yet to become infatuated with sentimentality and passion as they would during the romantic era as such then it was a time of transition lewis must have been aware of the danger as he saw it of people turning back as they had during the middle ages to religion for answers in a time of such upheaval he obviously felt that more religion was not the answer that too much religion can pervert the mind just as too much reason can this is why his work is still relevant today the battle over what role religion is to play in society still rages today these are only a few thoughts i hope will be helpful to those who might consider reading this book on the surface the book is a delightful romp into a fantasy realm underneath though there is a deeper current which reflects the broader course of history and still resonates today
as one reads peter pan one does n't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim i had ridiculously high expectations of barrie 's imagination before purchasing this title and he has fulfilled them completely many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense which i enjoy above all else darling the head of the darling family commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he 's supposed to take he brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs unfortunately for him during his bragging his medicine is found and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three sure enough when three is reached everyone except darling takes their medicine and darling once again tries to hide his this kind of scenario is what i 'd call mark twain nonsense you can imagine it being true even though it 's quite high up on the ridiculous scale then there 's what i would classify as nonsense aka bull which there is plenty of in barrie 's original story of peter pan going back to darling if we take a look at how he 's doing near the end of the book we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel ah yes grown men in pet taxis what could be more fun than the '' silliness of such a scene to be honest i do n't know if i 'd even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this other silly parts of the book involve wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls the narrator claiming he hates darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later the lost boys asking wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it the narrator using the phrase woke into life '' because peter likes the word woke '' more than wakened '' and my favorite captain hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark i believe the novel version of peter pan was written after the author had already established peter pan as a successful play that may explain a lot about the colorful narration which takes many many literary liberties we see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book wo n't be disappointed perhaps without these wacky and maybe even insane traits in the narration there 'd be no reason to read the book since it would be no different from the play after reading the peter pan novel though i 'd have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of peter pan without any wacky narration contrary to most adaptations of peter pan the individual lost boys of where there are six i believe are actually more developed as characters than john or michael darling heck at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the neverland to live with the darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions i may not like the actual land of neverland as much as i like the land of oz but barrie 's narration is unbeatable in my opinion he could probably make a jeopardy contestant 's friday night schedule sound exciting i believe barrie has written another peter pan book as well a prequel of sorts entitled peter pan in kensington gardens '' it should be interesting particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt peter throughout this book freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue the only thing i expected to see in this book that i did n't see was happy thoughts '' that must have been a creation of disney
i am nearly finished with this book i have n't been this mesmerized by a book in forever ! i would certainly recommend it
having patronized boulevard all but twice i still feel the need to write a review you have to understand that those of us back east '' think that california food is understated and so easy now not being a huge chef myself but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes my fave restaurants being of course boulevard and back east 2941 le tire bouchon maestro citronelle dc galileo inn at little washington i have no clue where i 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook other than maybe the san francisco ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market another real sf treat ! but to be real we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised now i was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and i have her handwriting just ingredients no measurements and yes i 've been able to improvise and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of recipes '' but nothing is better than going to the restaurant cookbooks are fab and fun but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals herselves are even more exciting buy this book even just for the photographs as i 've never been in a more and restaurant if only i did n't live on the east coast !
businesses can not exist without the it and they are interdependent it systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7. therefore we can not really view those who work at the business '' level as above us so i disagree with the author on this point however he does sort of make a u turn later on in the book this book will make you think for instance what is the supply demand for programmers in a particular business domain this would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career he talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology say java technology developers will have different intentions for example they might have a backup plan in case of it downturn either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products i agree about following your passion it enables us to transcend limitations it inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us this explains the previous paragraph which sounds like excuses another principle that he explains be the worst '' is very real two projects one early in my career where i had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager recently when i found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities they did affect my performance this book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations maintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it oh this is a developer job chad advises you to learn to love maintenance he recommends having a mentor and i am glad i read his book i know mentors can also come in the form of a book ! ! ! you can have more than one mentor i love the burn concept this explains why i get very depressed and productivity drops during the last few weeks of the project now i know how to make the work stay in the office no more nagging problems following me home ! the concept of presence '' is very realistic i learned this by making mistakes in the workplace and the cost was high i wish i had read this book early in my career lot of things that he explains has already happened to me in my career still i was able to learn how to handle those situations successfully next time around reading open source code really helps to solve recurring problems quickly i have experienced this in my job the cover of this book really needs to be improved the content of the book is much better than the quality of cover image
do n't get me wrong this was an enjoyable read since retiring matthew hope i guess em had an urge to return to sw florida with this tale funny adult repartee and a good mystery '' but only age reading level according to the amazon rating these latest books from mcbain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a rate but how about trying to stretch a bit
i have spent a lot of time and money researching into mormon history the big problem is that as henry ford once said history is bunk '' with joseph smith and the history of the mormon church there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many an ingenious charlatan there are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide hence using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of joseph smith can be a very frustrating and sometimes expensive exercise the church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony it is easy to see from my statement above why this book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what joseph smith produced forget about what might have happened in the early 1800 's and instead focus on the actual record contained in the book of mormon itself let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts this removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study thomas stuart ferguson starts out as the book of mormon 's most enthusiastic proponent he sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the first presidency for financial support and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the book of mormon bofm while he expects an abundance of material to be discovered he finds none nothing no evidence of the language or writings contained within the bofm the animals and crops mentioned artefacts city names weapons metals glass etc nothing for the period documented within the bofm 2500 bc 400 ad there are few discoveries outside this timeline but none within all he wanted and expected to find were actual artefacts or at least showing the above documented items the turning point came when fragments of the joseph smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960 's and found to contain nothing in common with the book of abraham this is a completely separate quest in itself see by his own hand upon papyrus '' while ferguson may have lost his faith he never left the lds church and continued to attend and support it he even sent a son on a mission he believed the mormon church was the best fraternity on earth '' in public he was a normal '' member in private circles he believed joseph smith was a fraud and as a result spent the remainder of his life researching why this book is both a document detailing ferguson 's quest for the truth and his way of dealing with it from the result
i call this one frank peretti lite '' it was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare this one had a creationist angle i really enjoyed it just not the same as his other books also you have to remember that this is fiction of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible but the central point about mutations comes through great summer read
i have n't had a chance to read the book in its entirity but have enjoyed what i have read
this book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript the images are combined with the text to convey meaning in the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context
one reviewer of this book said he 's sick of investing tomes they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients and of course those firms charge hefty fees even if their timing is slightly off say a few years or so another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years if only he had read the book in 1999. what is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by wall streeters with whom you can not compete and beat over time some of the smartest people in the world work on the street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody but they want you in the game they need you they take care of their biggest clients and i mean really big and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave usually at a loss because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time every winning trade requires a losing trade too bad past results are no etc etc try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw and its consequences everybody thinks they can get out in time trouble is when markets tank stock market real estate markets there is no getting out because there are no buyers it 's a free fall without a parachute many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year the author of this book ed eastering is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works which is useful in a textbook kind of way and he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor trouble is timing is everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet if it worked that well they would not be selling it to you so what 's the answer contrarian investing when everybody is long go short and vice versa good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran wall street trader it is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off and reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 inverted jenny another possibility do what most of the really rich usually do stuff it into treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity of course you have to keep them for the long term which the really rich can afford to do can you if not you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid so you 're stuck with safe notes which mature at par and pay the promised usually much lower interest rate not very exciting and if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less well that 's tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence gold this is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many the big guns say do n't speculate with money you ca n't afford to lose hey thanks that fits about percent of the investing population read easterling for the historical big picture and it ai n't a pretty picture it 's all about volatility and volatility is a killer and so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions err on the side of caution the first consideration of the physician is do no harm the first consideration of the financial investor is lose not thy wad of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass if that 's you may luck truly be with you
one of the most interesting books i 've ever read ! i could not put this one down if all economics books were written this well everyone would want to be an economist ! the author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling he will make you question every fact '' you 've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
in the 1970 's peter singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics animal liberation while some philosophers and others had in the past argued for the necessity of being kind to animals schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for buddhism peter singer was probably the first philosopher in western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals singer 's primary argument and a very interesting one is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals particularly in the structures of our vital organs nervous systems and brains singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering on these grounds singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights at least when they are being used by humans the fact animals can suffer means we ca n't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use but we need to consider them as fellow beings singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals using animals in agricultural contexts using animals for scientific experimentation or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge including the use of 'rape racks ' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments at the end of the book singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example singer 's work has been very powerful in its influence and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work however others have criticized his arguments quite strongly on many grounds it has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists some of whom have resorted to violent means to 'free ' animals from scientific experimentation while i admire singer 's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it i can not entirely agree with them it seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering i think a total ban on animal research especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health is excessive animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world no doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped where do we make changes when do we make them i certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed and suffering reduced as much as possible but preventing all suffering is impossible and reality will require compromise also as another ecologist remarked sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures but is often a necessity in australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting still the strongest thing in favour of singer 's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species we certainly need to redevelop a sense of what edmund wilson calls 'biophilia ' a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires
if you 're into reading memoirs this is exceptional her clarity of thought and her ability to portray her feelings into words is unsurpassed in my opinion i enjoy her prose so very much i can find myself relating to so many of her feelings and thoughts despite the difference of age and time this is a great read

i 'm a little late in reading this book i am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that i can enjoy a little harry potter at least every year i think goblet of fire is the best in the series so naturally it would be pretty difficult for phoenix to live up to that standard in goblet it feels like rowling had a fantastic ending in mind and that drove the writing of the story in phoenix it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information the major theme seemed to be the ministry 's takeover of hogwarts i found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing harry 's dreams however took on status and then rose to the top for the final conflict i did n't mind the length of the book but it did seem to drag in a couple of places the gang spent too much time at grimmauld place i could have also done without hagrid 's giant story my biggest problem with the book was dumbledore 's secrecy good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving goal in phoenix the cause for most of the confusion was that dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with harry he explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages the secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down it reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers it is contrived conflict that is hardly believable do n't get me wrong i love the harry potter series and perhaps my expectations have risen too high i am eagerly awaiting the movie and then i know i will devour book 6 when i allow myself to read it i lose interest in most book series after the first couple of installments harry potter always leaves me wanting more
after reading this account of the acension of everest you got ta wonder why anybody would want to is it really worth it for the thrill seaking personality of course it is for normal people forget about it even if you are n't into climbing mountains this book is gripping from page to page and you do n't want to put it down krakauer 's first book into the wild '' is also great but this one is better being a first person account i remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead forget them krakauer get 's it right with no hidden agenda unless you count surviving i would have liked more commentary from the surviving members though and not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain they risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once they 're dead they just leave them there what 's up with that
there is about as much additional science in social intelligence compared to emotional intelligence as you could write on a postcard mirror neurones and spindle cells nevertheless we can be thankful that daniel goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way firstly it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to awareness which is goodness secondly it them more clearly in an format note that this already existed in emotional intelligence but was not so clearly called out the most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fmri studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of relationships to psychic ecology a would be against the reliance on seligman 's and csikszentmihalyi 's questionnaire based results questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and

excellent realistic practical advice as parent of a very old i continually found myself in a power struggle with him over everything ! after reading this book in a couple of hours i immediately began implementing the techniques which are very common sense and simple and now just a couple of months later i have a totally different relationship with my little boy i no longer feel like i am controlling him all the time he is happily independent in ways we are both comfortable with this book really changed my life btw i had previously read the original love and logic for older children which i liked but it recommended spanking for children under 3. this did not help ! ! ! ! ! this book recommends no spanking but withdrawing all attention empathetically which is what my pediatrician recommended which actually works

john tyree is a soldier first a man second or so he thinks until he meets savannah lynn curtis while on leave he falls desperately in love with savannah the proverbial girl of his dreams sweet intelligent and giving john knows he 'll always carry her torch when september 11 changes the world john is no exception moved by patriotic loyalty he chooses to '' in the army adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to savannah more promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father this is the story of how an ideal love can falter despite its purity and strength not every romance results in a happy ending but with a great deal of luck those who do n't survive will find meaning from the experience love loyalty friendship all those sentiments are great but to what cost and how does this make a good man great this is john 's journey to that understanding it goes without saying that nicholas sparks is one of today 's master '' storytellers part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists such is the case in dear john sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components setting high emotion obstacles resolution then breaks it it is from the sadness that hope emerges and john tyree although still quite young gains wisdom that will last a lifetime sorrow will be a large part of this yes but there is room for something more something that will reach beyond the pages and touch john 's tomorrow in a way only he will see while this works there is something lacking it is one of those qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding maybe it 's the heavy reliance on john 's soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to john 's relationship with his father who appears to have asperger 's syndrome i 'm giving dear john for a beautiful story but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper reviewed by christina wantz fixemer
dale carnegie is one of the authors i have admired for so long there are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one he deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it of course there are many negative people who do n't like this book because they see everything in black and white carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate positive and humane approach to everyone around you it comes very close to treat the others as you want them to treat you '' i am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book the world will be a better place i am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important his viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex after all genius things are usually simple carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples i liked that the book is practical easy and fun to read and most of all that it delivers great value i can not say the same for many other books definitely get a copy especially if you are a good '' person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity

barrow an astronomer at the university of sussex when this book was published provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics what 'reality ' do mathematical entities like pi have what accounts for what physicist eugene wigner has called in a paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences '' 299 after an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism inventionism intuitionism and platonism a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor perhaps most mathematical workers follow what alfred korzybski called the 'christian science ' school of mathematics which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed ' activities '' science and sanity 748 i commend barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly barrow 's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations as for barrow 's conclusions from a view the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification the confusion of orders of abstracting barrow does n't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics he seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him as korzybski pointed out we live in a world of ordered structures or relations it does not seem unreasonable then that we can map this world with an exact language of relations mathematics but as korzybski also pointed out many times the map is not the quot
this is one of those life changing books i first came across this while looking midlessly through my local spiritual '' bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours as a fast read with a simple concise message this book lacks nothing it is n't dated unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated richard bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view jesus christianity god and yourself in a brand new light needless to say this is a five out of five buy it today and then give it away
this book was mind expanding and told a great story of exploring the facets of one 's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others my favorite part was the story of the golden pages '' where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man 's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm if not war

i have been a fan of larry work for years ever since i first stumbled onto his cartoon guide to statistics he covers a subject the way it should be innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line it was this historical approach that made carl sagan 's cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science i have long said that we teach science backward we still teach on a century model we start with biology then chemistry and finally physics even when i was in high school i wished that i could take physics before chemistry before i was elected as a school board director i was on our district 's gifted advisory council i made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and then biology last i was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics so why not teach the math along with the science integrate it no that would make it too relevant i felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a nobel laureate making the same assertion that i had been making for teach science backwards after all the toughest course out there is least that is what every med student i know has ever said and biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster not being the least of these frontiers gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first because in this book on chemistry he introduces quantum mechanics which is normally taught as physics on page 28. do n't let he word cartoon '' in larry books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved he makes each subject accessible while being entertaining but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject so when i needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping it took me about thirty seconds to find my book i went right to larry gonick

i remember my father giving me this book when i was young he was a junior high school english teacher and used this book in class together we read the stories and i loved them now i am a college professor and use the book in class myself while some of the summaries are dated '' they are still useful in communicating the basic action of the play to students and the very fact that they are dated '' allows the book to serve as an illustration of how interpretations of shakespeare 's plays have changed since the lambs ' time i recommend this book heartily

the characters are tom a navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle and kally a doctor caring for her terminally ill father sounds like a typical match for a romance novel but this novel is so much more than that kelly and tom have a past but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past all four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend i think i have yet another author to add to my favorite list this novel not only has a suspensful gripping plot but is packed with romance and excitment on many levels most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others not so with this one there are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel and expertly blended to create the whole the reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn some are pleasant and some sad this is truly a moving tale on all levels you won 't be dissapointed
suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in the mystery '' portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired i really did n't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin who clearly stole the show in this book as a matter of fact of the different plots and stories going on in this book jules ' was the best it was not only very and sweet but even as a hetrosexual female i could identify with jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him happens to all of us whether you are in a gay or straight relationship i am really hoping that jules either gets his own book or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness i do share brockmann 's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance nationality sexual orientation etc and i really like how she includes this in her books as far as i 'm concerned love is love no matter what and it 's portrayed beautifully here please brockmann do n't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline it 's a very good one

as a prospective college student i have to tell you how much i appreciate students ' guide to colleges it combines many of the best features of the princeton review and fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness i also appreciate that it is without any blather because these are not profiles they 're written by actual students this is a great compliment i have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year and this is the best guide to colleges among the many i 've seen i also just read the oberlin college profile in this book with an oberlin alum and relative she said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate oberlin portrayal she 's read in a guide among other things she and i loved the different student perspectives and the questions like what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour '' the guide 's honesty also impressed me as the fiske guide lauded vassar 's diversity '' for example where students ' guide admits although vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot most students are actually wealthy and white '' i am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from hampshire to harvard will find this book incredibly useful ! !

i would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by goldin on is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an armed forces combat unit during the second world war this book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the army throughout the past century these attitudes may have been important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level they too may have had certain effect on overall policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into auschwitz there were also efforts to influence negatively american attitudes towards the emerging jewish state in israel this is in a way a sad and yet important book to read it chronicles how that fundamental american ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice and ignorance
'a little history of the world ' is exactly what the title indicates gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the century gombrich covers cave men great religious leaders philosophers and events over an incredible timeline i got this book for my eight year old son and i to read together there were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events in particular the chapters covering the inquisition and the causes that lead to the french revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand this book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in it may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest
the original publication of lives of john in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria much of it emanated from yoko ono who likened goldman 's book to being punched in the face '' yoko is a close friend of jann wenner of rolling stone magazine which duly ran an article attempting to discredit goldman 's book some of lennon 's fans took this behavior in and assumed that lives of john was forbidden they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty now however the dust has settled and lives of john holds up beautifully each contention of goldman 's which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands remember the ridiculous panic over goldman 's portrait of lennon as a heavy drug user that drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew lennon including ono and lennon 's first wife cynthia powell the same is true about goldman 's claims about lennon 's tendency towards violence a tendency lennon himself owned up to in his playboy interview and while ono and others acted agitated over goldman 's depiction of lennon as bisexual ono herself is found to have said she considered john lennon a closet fag '' in a 1981 interview why then was ono so upset by the appearance of goldman 's book because of what it reveals about her it will be clear to anyone who approaches goldman 's book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified lives of john is not dishonest or flawed in any way a perusal at his sources '' section reveals his awesome thoroghness goldman bravely explored areas of lennon 's and ono 's lives that others shied away from out of deference to ono a worshipful attitude towards lennon and a reluctance to figure things out albert goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject lives of john might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify lennon but for those with genuine interest in lennon it is indispensable
many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports i would agree as i have reporting experience with and crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly if you like learning in a fashion right out of a book this is the book ! the bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book while this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book for example one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book i would agree with that i was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book if you want a better reference book try the wrox book professional sql server 2005 reporting services that book is not as good as this book from a standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions for example page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows they call it greenbar reports it was not easy to find in this book either how many people would look up greenbar reports '' in the reference i was looking into shading alternative rows '' i just happened to stumble upon it i bought both books together of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at reporting services reporting services could use a text like they have for access and other programming languages those types of books have served me well over the years until then this book and the wrox book should do the trick
i am a lutheran church librarian and i am glad i bought this very satisfactory book for our church library its text stresses that children are the same the world over they have the same feelings and needs and have the same hopes and dreams the illustrations are a nice change from the usual each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded the illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor drawn in persian style the colors are very saturated the book 's cover gives you an idea of what they look like the message of this book is one of diversity that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities races ethnicities languages or faiths they still have the same hopes dreams and daily needs this is a very important message for children to hear in today 's world where there is so much suspicion of those we perceive '' to be different the more children realize that kids are the same everywhere the more tolerant they will be children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age say researchers so you have to nip it in the bud very early and this book does that in a wonderful way

a really great book by a great man i almost laughed out loud while on a train and am sure people thought i was crazy the book made me wonder how can you lead such an interesting life and yet win a nobel prize in physics i guess you can though the book does not follow a chronological order i could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life if he ever got old towards the later stages in the book i could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity particularly in scientific research and life in general around him a wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts
as a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text mechanism and theory in organic chemistry '' by lowry and richardson this book by anslyn and dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student i agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging the text is clearly written and the material relates well back to current research issues if you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program get this book before you try advanced organic chemistry structure and mechanisms '' by carey and sundberg i expect that modern physcial organic chemistry '' will become a staple to most chemist 's shelves similar to that of a crc handbook or advanced organic chemistry '' by march
line by line this book has some of the best writing i 've seen in a while this is an amazing thing since it 's still very and not at all overwritten the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor the book surprised me constantly with its insights and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week i read craig 's first book and it does n't stand up to this at all it 's exciting to see how much the writer has improved and i ca n't wait for the next one

i 've read and the book although not it 's full content but randomly i open it and find a surprise each time i just love it
i 've gotten through about of the book and i 'm highly amused the first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far however i 've laughed my way through them one thing eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor if you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that 's loaded with wit i 'd suggest picking up this book i never knew there were four kinds of people before morons fools lunatics and cretins and i may just be a fool SMILE
this entry in the fang mulheisen series came as a surprise it was closer to something by elmore leonard or even carl hiaassen great engaging characters funny dialogue and an excellent plot
if you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics i started with and at the time it seemed revolutionary but though i loved it was a hard days work then came jill bond and she was really talking bulk cooking ! when deborah 's first book came out i was excited because it fit in with my lifestyle this book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive the meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you do n't want to heat up the kitchen my favorites are the cheese and chicken shells not for everyone however chicken enchiladas taste great made with homemade tortilla if you do that crab rice chowder gourmet bean casserole and everyone loves spaghetti pie there are lots of good recipes in this book the drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions i felt that i was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions that is okay but not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans worth trying if you are serious about freezer cooking but i would start with frozen assest first
i had eyed this book for quite some time before i purchased it and i am so glad i did ! the pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book ! most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based so do n't pick this book up looking for lots of drinks though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy such as a s'mores hot chocolate the recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty piping hot drinks

this book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre it does the hard work of picking out a crucial piece of a song for you ! great for auditions the book has selections from musicals old and new familiar and rare as well as movies even some disney ! there 's one for every vocal part granted not every piece is exactly 16 bars some go a bit over but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing it 's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out it 's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals
the big sky is not just a masterpiece it 's probably the masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction this is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that is n't really dealt with that much the rocky mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 1850. the cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in cowboy '' movies mirror our own experiences in many ways the cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to americans when actually nothing was further from the truth cowboys were regular working stiffs about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day they did n't consider themselves free '' nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day they did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage and there was a bit of swagger to it people in town recognized cow hands for the men they were especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had but it was backbreaking work and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years i said all that to say that the big sky '' really is about freedom and really is about the west it 's about the true wild primitive west before the plow before roads when there were still huge intact indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo so it 's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored but i can see why there are no plots just begging to be turned into movies no new sherriff in town '' characters because there are no sherriffs and no towns other than a few trading posts there is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those indians if you do n't already know this is the story of boone caudill and his friend jim deakins and several important side characters but it 's basically boone 's book he 's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom and is pushed out by a brutal father he makes his way west to louis along the way befriending deakins in hopes of meeting his uncle zeb who had become a trapper years earlier the rest of the tail is complex and interlaced and not a simplistic good guy plot at all and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all arching like the sky itself is freedom freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book freedom is the religion the politics the philosophy the recreation it is everything that is important the trappers are there to trap sure but they 're really there because this is a wild free place where they will not be hampered by rules where they can be natural men it sounds over romanticized but it really did happen that way and from what we know that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns boone cries lord jim remember the tetons standing proud in the sun and the seeds ke dee do n't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save injun '' this novel makes you sob like few i 've ever read the sense of loss the closing of an age of the world hangs in the air like mist they are going to be the last to see something so precious and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement the movie the mountain men '' with charleton heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book and you can tell it 's inspired in many ways by it but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel jeremiah johnson '' is another good film with many fine touches but if you want to follow the water up stream back to its source in the mountains then please before you grow too old read the big sky '' and open your heart to that time and place and the wild brazen beauty of the america few americans know ever existed
this is a great compliment to the more make magazine as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the makers '' of course it also describes and shows in beautiful photographs their projects but it 's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers bored brainiacs and souls who are the heart of the newest form of the diy geek culture creating incredible projects from the mega a home built submarine for 3 to the micro a diy bat detector to the whimsical a lego blocks project that will solve the rubik 's cube if you 're a vociferous reader of slashdot you may have seen some of these projects before but the book really gets into the motivation behind them production values writing and design are superb and of course urls are provided so you can find out more on the makers ' sites bottom line this fascinating survery of make culture and cool projects is a must for every geek 's coffee table and it 's also a great way to introduce your mom into what it is you actually do with your spare

my comments are not on the cev translation but rather on this particular edition among all low cost editions of the whole bible protestant canon this one is outstanding in three respects 1 it has the most extensive annotations footnotes introductions and outlines for each book of the bible and study helps of any they are not as extensive as many study bibles of course but it is a fraction of the price 2 these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias thus this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations 3 it has the largest print size many low cost editions have rather small print

i thought this was an excellent book those who say this wo n't turn you into a champion overnight i 've got news for you no book can do that only you can i 've raced retired now for most of my adult life including some pro races some of my crew have gone onto champ cars nascar and i was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the champ car title and my engineer was from that team this book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career those who ca n't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they do n't need to buy any books but most of us do n't have last names like andretti senna unser etc if any of you have ever read senna 's book on driving you might also say it 's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to not what he writes directly about few people will directly give you the secrets '' to motorsports
peter watson holding a number of research degrees offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the century in this book not being an easy read it takes some time to get through the main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the century in its economic and social context this is quite an achievement considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics watson tends to cover science the best and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of century science including the theories of relativity quantum mechanics scientific cosmology evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene however the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy watson dismisses husserl 's phenomenology as 'abstract ' and of little importance when in fact phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the century along with analytical philosophy founded by russell and wittgeinstein and attracted so many leading european minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory overall though watson 's work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know and where we are going
i read this book in less than one week normally i spend and average time of a month in finishing a book but this was one of the rare '' cases that the reading last until 2 am marcus travels to a wild land germania libera in order to send a gift of the emperor and ends with his life in hands of a german sorceress the full novel is filled with action and historical references it 's worth the money !
i absolutely loved this book ! i could relate to each of the four women at different times in their lives it reminded me to take all things to him in prayer at all times

having worked with vbscript for a little over four years i am by no means an expert however i feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting i was pretty skeptical when i saw the word advanced '' in the title but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters the book begins with securing including digital certs and policies and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in wmi and adsi for me personally the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with wsf and wsc files don and jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind xml functionality as well as it 's application within the scripted files these guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies they wrap up the package peice with explanations around hta 's and form controls in html scripts the book moves on to cover topics such as adsi and ado scripting working with wshcontroller and remote scripts wmi and wql classes and techniques and different applicable real world examples all this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug sign and package your scripts as well the wizards wmi adsi wsf etc and other tools available to make scripting easier i 've obtained quite a few vbscript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced vbscripting if you are new to scripting with vbscript you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods properties classes etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use while this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it thumbs up ! highly recommended bang for the buck
rather than reading a biography of red auerbach wilt chamberlain and bill russell turn to this period book ! here you get everything a complete portrayal of the situation of african american who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the brooklyn dodgers but at the same time it is an introduction to a time when athletes were not the superstars of today on top of that you get enough biographcal information on russell and chamberlain but also on cousy auerbach and many others the book is very well written and starts right with information no tedious introduction to plough through
i got this book for my fiance on the recommendation of my rabbi she loves it

new taste of has the beautiful pictures of a coffee table book but it has a lot of academic substance and a lot of value to the reader the main chapters are growing up with cacao a natural and cultural history of chocolate from cacao to chocolate identifying cacao tasting chocolate recipes there is also a glossary and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from for a beginner like myself who loved chocolate but had n't progressed much beyond hershey 's with almonds when i read the book new taste of was very educational it explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate it explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you do n't know what you 're doing and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage it was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate the discussion about criollo forastero and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint i later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants including wheat the plants that make the tastiest highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate so growers breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a but still profitable crop or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything the recipes were also interesting after reading this book i became more adventurous in my and started trying some of the european imports i see in the local grocery stores my only regret is i am now knowledgeable enough and my tastes are spoiled enough that m ms and hersheys with almonds seem pretty bland
this book has a photo of each dessert so you can see what you 're making and easy recipes that look impressive all using a cake mix box of some kind their snickerdoodle cake uses a white cake mix some other ingredients and includes a cinnamon buttercream frosting recipe yum ! i love the variety of recipes bundts bars round layered etc and my kids and i can do many together i think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste so these recipes just build on those mixes i just want easy recipes that are n't intimidating and this book is the solution for that i highly reccommend the cake mix doctor
this was a childhood favorite of mine which i frequently read in the library of the troy jewish community center 87 first street i can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as harry danning sid gordon and moe berg of course there were undoubted greats like hank greenberg and sid luckman and there was in boxing too barney ross and benny leonard perhaps there are more date books about jews in sports but i doubt there are any which tell a story as well and give the young person such a warm feeling about the jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life the most important form of human activity
this is an easy to use instructional manual with practical assignments to help you retain the information given highly recommended
we love this book mom and two year old included ! gerald the giraffe finds music that he loves and is able to dance like never before fun text colorful illustrations this is a book we have read over and over in our house has a great message about finding the music that works for you i love it so much i bought a copy for our niece !
if one approaches this book with a view to learning music theory one would be slightly disappointed the author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type all in all i think this book will come in useful after i 've learned music and need to review theory from time to time great book though
i 'm a fan of bill myers work and have been since blood of heaven '' this one slipped by me somehow and when i saw it i immediately got it while the plot is somewhat tight for the most part i do have some problems with parts of it for one thing the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him read the book to find out should n't have any qualms about killing millions of others so why is he so intent on the stones but the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old the minute anything happens they 're all screaming each other 's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it for the emergency we can live with it but when something happens every few chapters you 've got to have a break ! daniel ! '' tyler ! '' helen ! '' tyler ! '' daniel ! '' dad ! '' helen ! '' tyler ! '' give me a break ! otherwise a good story though not up to the same level as threshold '' or blood of heaven '' definitely better than eli '' though recommended

this book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children however the concept of a child '' is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control these difficult children actually have poor will power and self control the techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control it is important to understand that the cause of the child is an excessive drive for power over others the strong willed child wants to be captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand parenting this type of child correctly will help him learn to better control himself and respect others however he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for

joe pickett 's daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was his wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does and there 's still the temptations both of them thought about while joe was away at jackson hanging over their marriage his relationship with his fast growing up daughter sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make joe 's life a misery throw in a civil war between saddlestring 's largest family and the appearance of after along term behind bars bloodthirsty keeley who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter 's joe 's stepdaughter 's death through the slow and torturous murder of joe pickett and one way or another the era of saddlestring 's game warden is set to end box 's joe pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel the initial open season was a surreal not quite but almost carl hiaasen type novel then savage run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure trophy hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many i was glad when out of range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller a style which continues with in plain sight i would strongly suggest reading these books in order starting with open season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and in plain sight is certainly no exception to that it will be interesting to see if box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure
in plain sight offers an exceedingly thin plot and thin characters but it is still an enjoyable read owin entirely to author box 's prowess at telling a story saddlestring wyoming is enjoying the dawning of spring and unsuprisingly for a police procedural a possible murder opal scarlett the grand and really mean old lady of thunderhead ranches has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play tom wayman an alcoholic fishing guide is brought in as a suspect opal in violation of the law charged wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs through her land she strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river frankly there 's not a lot of excitement here joe pickett wyoming game warden is dealing with a problematic new boss and his 14 year old daughter sheridan sheridan just happens to be the best friend of jule scarlett daughter of hank scarlett one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch of course they ca n't find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when joe arrives to drop off julie julie it turns out does n't live with her father hank no she lives with opal 's eldest son arlen on his side '' of the ranch there 's a third brother wyatt who is a bit on the weird side the very weird side enter keely a good old boy who is on the run from mississippi where he has murdered a couple on his way to wyoming to settle a personal vendetta against joe pickett keely murders a prisoner and then guns down a cowboy who did nothing more than get keely angry again not much here keely is not a convincing bad guy more like a typed out description of a bad '' guy under the name of bill monroe which author box reminds us several times is also the name of a famous country and western musician goes to work for both of the arlen brothers golly gee several nasty things happen at the pickett household oh my the fbi keeps inquiring into the whereabouts of nate romanski or something close to that spelling who apparently figured largely in a previous novel all this produces tension in the pickett household high job stress arguments with best friends yawn just not a lot of excitement here either finally comes the climax rain thunder floods pickett 's daughers kidnapped ! the truth comes out ! box tries for a surprise ending but it 's kind of like a wet firecracker all that said in plain sight '' is still an enjoyable if not particularly suspenseful read he has a strong writing style and does a nice job of weaving in a feel for wyoming 's people that is in my opinion stronger than the underlying story this is the sixth of the joe pickett novels i wo n't be going out of my way to read the older ones but i will keep an eye out for anything new by box he 's definitely a comer even if he has n't arrived jerr
this book is comprehensive and easy to follow every recipe i have tried has worked the pecan pie recipe is especially good and very easy for novice bakers if you could have only one dessert book on your shelf this would be it
growing one 's herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle if you 've ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you 've managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you if you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that i never could have imagined let alone used the bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it 's use from root to leaves the only problem i found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names which unless you 're so inclined is difficult to find quickly this is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable a page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used it tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it 's uses which includes the medicinal use even if i do n't use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs this book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over a perfect garden companion for that break under a tree the knowledge can prove to be invaluable even such common herbs as thyme can present posssibly new insights into it 's benefits have trouble sleeping the leaves of thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it 's many other attributes there is much more information than i need here but there is something for everyone from herbal dyes to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri this is as the title suggests the complete book on herbs a great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs
histoire et collections has done it fine work of the quality which the collector and researcher has come to expect from this publisher i have previous works on the british tommy in nw europe and canadian soldiers all are elaborately illustrated with charts individual item photos and reconstructions worn by models of combinations of equipment and clothing as qoen in northern europe in addition there are many lists charts and tables gathering together informatioon gleaned from many scarce and obscure publications muxh of rhia work has appeared in the excellent french language periodical militaria published also by histoire et collections this method of proceeding has the great virtue of first publishing in a more temporary format and inviting the readers to submit corrections and additional data which can be used to improve the final work published in book form
i love to browse through different cookbooks i have quite a collection and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before i decide to purchase the entire book i normally look for 3 things in a cookbook besides delicious recipes that will work for my family this includes 1 pictures of more than of the recipes color pictures are the best 2 a spiral binding or at least one that easily lays flat 3 new innovative recipes that have ingredients i can easily find at a grocery store i also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium fat content protein fiber and carbohydrates i picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events let 's face it eating out is n't always the best for you especially since you can not always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting i wanted some new recipes to try but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying what is it '' i was not disappointed the book offered many beautiful color photographs and the pages themselves were glossy and thick not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use all of the nutrient information was included along with a column called nutrient bonus '' that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of vitamin c calcium etc the book was hard cover but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat another good bonus so that i was not always struggling to keep my page open it also contains a rather large vegetarian section some of our favorites include seafood salad with citrus vinaigrette bistro beef salad vietnamese style beef noodle broth mock risotto chicken stuffed with golden onions fontina almond crusted chicken fingers tilapia with mango salsa and loaded twice baked potatoes enjoy !

trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in hunger sex and revolutionary marxism which was the driving force behind his life and work mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger that observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the marxist tradition however as trotsky demonstrates here marxist methodology can not and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle here trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development in a healthy society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged if the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality in a sense it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production what marxism aimed for and trotsky defends here is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish that is the thought that underpins trotsky 's work here as he analyzes various trends in russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the october revolution of 1917. in short marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness you will find no deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here quite the contrary here trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected or not affected by the october revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends he analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature like futurism and constructivism and some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive the most important and lasting polemic which trotsky raised here however was the fight against the proponents of culture ' the argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the soviet union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement read a monopoly on the literary front trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that in theory at least as its turned out the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting culture ' would have time to develop although history did not turn out to prove trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development one of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals particularly western intellectuals based some of their sympathy for trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write this was particularly true during the 1930 's here in america where those who were but were repelled by the vacuity of the socialist party were drawn to him a few like james farrell studs lonigan trilogy did this mostly honorably most like dwight macdonald and sidney hooks etc did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to such is the nature of the political struggle a note for the inclined who read this book trotsky wrote this book in at the time of lenin 's death and later while the struggle for succession by stalin zinoviev and kamenev was in full swing while trotsky did not recognize it until later nor did others for that matter this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution hereafter the people who ruled the soviet union the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically in short thermidor in the classical french revolutionary expression was victorious given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in society at that time

not great maybe but good the theme is vampire the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle but what if the night goes on and on good suspense good characters and development and an artistic style that carries the mood it 's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette black white and blood red but it works recommended
john little and peter sisco wrote static contraction but john takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight muscle my girlfriend and i started doing this method in may of 2005 and i can honestly say i 've never found such a fast quick and easy way to build muscle this is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym after a while you only need to workout once a week but do n't forget to stretch afterwards and do n't forget to do cardio on other days i 've never been able to develop the abs until i used the techniques in this book not to mention all the other muscles popping out that i never knew were there before ! i do n't entirely agree with his take on supplements although i think he 's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money apparently he 's not familiar with shaklee

i admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in piece of my heart '' di stanley chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert his teenage daughter has facts to hide and di chadwick walks a fine line dci alan banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder the plot has already been outlined so i 'll just say it 's a delight to visit dci banks again i 'm never disappointed
the third book of a series and follow the story line i have not finished it yet but am enjoying it
ed hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it does n't do justice to the man himself his dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them having shared some of his adventures but as a cop i found that he loves cops if it was n't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one his book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style he does n't know how to go at half speed and neither does the book his upfront approach is evident he just does n't have time for it 's a quick read and an enjoyable one make sure that you take it with you on vacation ! it will make it more enjoyable
lenin wrote this book in 1917 while he was hiding from the russian government lenin pointed out that the question of the relation of the state to the social revolution and of the social revolution to the state like the question of revolution generally was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the second international '' he wanted to correct that oversight and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book the state and revolution '' is a very short book well structured and not difficult to read at all initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters but lenin did n't conclude the seventh due to the outbreak of the russian revolution in the postscript to the first edition he explains that saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time but that all the same it is more pleasant and useful to go through the of revolution ' than to write about it '' the main idea in the state and revolution '' is that the state is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class a special coercive force '' that rules through violence the state of the bourgeoisie will disappear but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat the proletariat the working class will become then the ruling class capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system the proletariat needs state power a centralized organization of force an organization of violence both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population peasants the petty bourgeoisie and in the work of organizing a socialist economy '' the dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to communism then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase and with it to the complete withering away of the state '' according to lenin the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of marx and engels all throughout this book lenin cites and examines marx and engels ' writings in order to explain and support his own point of view the importance of marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously but i advice you to read this book nonetheless it is certainly not a grueling task and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many marxist leaders believed with all their hearts ideas drive men and men make history the state and revolution '' will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas and that is not a small feat belen alcat

this book is the best book on rand 's esthetics i 've ever read in fact it is the only book on the topic that i know of it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by rand they approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory they demolish abstract art and devote considerable energy to discussing rand 's definition of art they even propose their own individual alternatives ! if anything shows independence it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work ! remarkable ! the world of rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship that is clear just by reading one of the reviews here by people who are devotees of certain scholars '' who do nothing but repeat the catechism they take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published that is why they hate this book because it is judge for yourself do n't be fooled

barbara ghazarian 's book is a wonderful collection of recipes that originated in an ancient culture i enjoyed reading about her family and how armenian food remains a large part of the communal family experience these foods from the mediterranean region are exciting flavorful and easy to make barbara 's emphasis on bulgur wheat a staple in the armenian diet is particularly important as this whole grain product has stood the test of time it might even be considered the gold standard of healthy grains simply armenian gives americans a way to incorporate whole grains meats and vegetables into a healthy meal that a family can share while i read the book a line kept running through my head our grandmothers were right '' they cooked with simple whole foods that provided excellent nutrition and variety from recipes that were handed down from mother to daughter simply armenian allows us to cook like our grandmothers and provide the same healthy choices for our modern families
this is a novel about the end of the world every single adult on the planet died there are a couple of kids living in a house alone so begins the trilogy fascinating scary and intriguing the story is really interesting i mean slap in your face i love this intersting a couple of the images were really disturbing though like the fact that hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket the kids in the story are fascinating and the teacher 's was so wierd that it was actually kind of scary then angerman is introduced he 's really messed up but i get the idea that he knows something about the virus that the others do n't this makes him an amazing character and even if you do n't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy i really love this series though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers well worth anyone who is into and apocalypse as i was at the time i read this book five months ago and i still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks talk about powerful writing
when i read ron penton 's first book data structures for game programming i could n't wait to see what he did next mud game programming lived up to all of my expectations and indeed surpassed them the author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable and equally important making them interesting reading mud game programming is like having a friendly cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade instead of just telling you what to do he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a mud server enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project which might not be the same you end up with not just knowledge but understanding i highly recommend mud game programming to people doing any type of multiplayer programming not just traditional muds i 'd give this book six stars if they 'd let me
i love this book such a great novel detailing the friendship and bonds of a group of women over the years i 'll be it
good books on popular music are frankly few and far between this is one of those precious few journalist dan leroy has done a remarkable job of piecing together the details of the creation of this album even better he has written an engaging story it might be a cliche but i could n't put it down
this book shows you in an easy to read format the true capabilities of the dvd format and what is required to do it it helped me in being able to ask intelligent questions when purchasing equipment
what i like about this book is that the tone is just right for a preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it and i bet he 'll take a look inside some books are so clinical others do n't provide enough information this one gets it right at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader as someone who has been writing for girls for years i 'm always curious about what is out there for boys and i like daldry 's style carol weston author of girltalk all the stuff your sister never told you

another incredible read from cj box i 'm intrigued in the manner he sets up the future of joe pickett in each of his books i could n't put this one down
i studied the medieval islamic world a little in college and fell in love it 's a fascinating age in which central asian buddhists north african nomads ethiopian slaves greek persian aristocrats arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together mixed wrote wonderful literature and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun but it 's hard to find anything written about the time that is n't arcane professor babble or islam 101 you know there are five pillars of islam '' snore here hugh kennedy has written the book i always wanted he wisely concentrates on medieval islam 's golden age the early abbasid dynasty when baghdad ruled a large portion of the even more astutely on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court let 's face it you read about the abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt why her son harun was immortalized in the arabian nights and why the barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life he 's up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats but the common people of baghdad the pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets '' who fought back when their city was besieged and the middle class who developed islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative kennedy does n't believe everything he reads and does n't think you will either he repeats the harem intrigue '' tales in which devious women are blamed for various are almost certainly not true but tell us something about the people who believed them and are still enormously entertaining he also is frank about the relationships male and female that were a part of the era 's culture without the awkwardness of many modern historians and he 's smart enough to explain the southern iraq could support such a fabulously wealthy monarchy and why the iran region was so critical to the faraway middle a way an american can understand very rare for books on islamic history the book boasts an excellent map naming both cities and for a hapless westerner who does n't know where the major cities of iran are today never mind where kingdoms like yamama and ushrusana used to be there 's also a surprisingly good index another rarity the book is n't flawless kennedy twice awkwardly interrupts his straightforward account of political events with fascinating chapters on aspects of court poetry science and my favorite women 's lives unfortunately this structure means the reader learns about the palace mutawakkil built before she knows enough about him to care and does n't hear anything about ma'mun patronage of scientific research until long after he 's dead in the main narrative the last chapter goes into far too much detail about the depressing downfall of the dynasty a more interesting discussion about its legacy but all in all kennedy does a great job and i for one plan down to hunt down his earlier books if you know nothing about islamic history and want an accessible introduction to an fascinating period or like me know a little and want to learn more i highly recommend this book
with all the sensationalism and relentless obfuscation of the realities of life by the media i found this an exhillarating and thought provoking book there 's more but i 'm sure you 'll read and revisit this book again and again once it 's prominently displayed on your bookshelf worth every penny
pamela jaye smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth she has an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology spirituality and metaphysics yet her real gift is being able to relate all of this amazing information in an entertaining and clear manner so that it 's easy to understand the book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures i highly recommend it
in this study demos examines family life as it was for the pilgrims who came over on the mayflower before they joined with the massachusetts bay colony the book is in three main sections the physical setting housing furnishings and clothing the structure of the household family connections including servants and individual development childhood coming of age and old age the most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the court although laws were not draconian they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly mess up and you would be punished but it 's also true that people were not that different back then either parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them families were at the core of society 's welfare even women were given rights denied them in the mother country it 's interesting that even these first settlers saw the american continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from plymouth itself thus weakening communal ties a highly recommended book
this book is a big hit with my class ! i was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while i was reading this they have memorized most of the book they all loved it ! an excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures ! i 'd definitely recommend reading this book ages four through maybe second grade
since almost all of my good girl friends including myself have gone through nasty breakups lately i have become much like the gideons in that i have practically resorted to buying a case full of these fabulous books and carrying them around in my trunk distributing them to my poor heartbroken friends it is the perfect thing to read when you 're in that stage beautiful beautiful work if all you have to complain about this book is that you did n't learn how to properly can you 're missing the point pay the extra 5 bucks and spring for the lovely hardcover it 's worth it i can not say enough wonderful things about this scrumptious funny simple little insightful jewel ! mwah
i really enjoyed this work didnt know this guy won a pulitzer but it figures i was swept away by the imagery created by this master it was evocative of cooper although he surpasses cooper and mcmurtry and the guy who wrote all the pretty horses '' the master '' can always create the world to drown the reader in this guy is great i plan to read the whole
in a hobby filled with opinions this was a shop for beginning to of my first large aquarium it was exactly what i was looking for in a book of this nature i 'm not going to say it 's the best worst or in between because it 's the only one of this nature i bought since then of course like most folks i 've read web sites talked to others in the hobby and formed my own opinions but the reason i bought this book was to cut through the confusion and get started and for that it was terrific could have used a bit more on fish and plants and that 's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. next revision he should throw in a bit more on the fish he picks offer some alternatives within the scenarios he set up
anna anastasia i have researched this great mystery for some time now and i have concluded that the woman anna anderson could not have been an imposter not only did she never give any signs of playing a part but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known she knew of gleb botkin 's paintings before he even came to see her she knew exactly what she and her sister tatiana had been doing while wwi was being declared for russia this was confirmed by rudnev who was visiting russia and saw anastasia and tatiana at that time she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in europe and could recognize her royal sight by their voices alone one must wonder how a demented polish farming girl could do that aside from just her character there the many scars and lacerations on her body as well as the bunions on her feet identical to anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support anna anderson 's claim for over six decades royal cousins and friends to anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks they would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would it is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake anna had people such as alexei volkov and alexadra tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched no one has ever yet attempted to explain why ambassador zahle and grand duke andrew 's papers are still kept secret why doris wingender touched up her photographs in court or why pierre gilliard had his scandalous midnight 'burning ' of evidence to this day anthropologists who compare anna anderson 's face ears and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the two '' women are the same the franziska schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end anna anderson was several inches shorter than franziska schanzkowska wore a size shoe three inches smaller was not mentally insane like franziska she spoke a bad german while fs spoke german as her first language and could understand russian the schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of russian when spoken to them aa clearly understood russian anderson also gave birth to a child there is no record of franziska ever having a child recent documents also show that schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on anna anderson 's body the dna tests have won the hour but i hope the future will see the release of ambassador zahle and gd andrew 's papers to cast even more doubt on this richard schweitzer 's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at martha jefferson hospital during the complicated court battle between marina botkin schweitzer and the russian nobiltiy association according to massie 's book one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time is it reasonable that the royal families would ignore the fact that anna anderson was about to recieve recognition as the tsar 's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life in any case the body of anastasia is still missing although in russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads 'anastasia ' measuring despite the fact that anastasia was the shortest of her sisters if this is n't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda i do n't know what is i 'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over castle seeon under the stone which reads anastasia manahan '' to end this i will quote empress alexandra 's best friend aside from anna vyrobouva lili dehn who met anna anderson in 1957 and declared do n't bother to tell me she has read these things in books i have recognized her physically and intuitively through signs which do not decieve what can i say after having known her i could not have been mistaken '' this is to explain my conviction that anna anderson was anastasia i think there is something about the dna we do not know the file on the 2002 edition 362 'nearly fifty years ago anna anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in tobolsk she played a male part she 'recalled ' and and had to borrow a man 's at a pivotal moment in the play a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs revealing that she was wearing the tsar 's against the bitter cold of the siberian winter the family said anna anderson had hooted with laughter the only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene and who are known to have survived were the two family foreigners one was the english tutor sydney gibbes and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975. they include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in tobolsk the cast '' gibbes wrote had its happiest night with an edwardian farce by henry grattan called 'packing up ' anastasia took the male part at the end of the farce the 'husband ' had to turn his back open his as if to take it anastasia used an old one of mine but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased emperor jaguer 's underwear ' so far as exhaustive research can establish only anna anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote in private and three decades before the gibbes memoirs appeared if anderson was a phoney as the seemingly damning dna evidence now tells us how did she know the story that was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in anna anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict ian lilburn a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the anastasia '' appeal process in the german courts had a calmer response than some i think '' he said knowing he sounded like a luddite and romanov there is something we do n't know about the dna '' maybe after reading you can understand why some of us do n't believe the dna was anna anderson 's and why we do n't believe she was the tall size shoe wearing franziska schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter
it 's been around two years since i first read this book and i must say i reference it to people all the time the reason it is so darn fascinating i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data if i gave you an tape right now would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it younger folks might not know what it is they would recognize tape maybe but 100 years from now how many players would be around the book talks about a project the author was on a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans or others in the future that the site is radioactive since the radiation could last years the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now what would the message be like if you read the book you 'll find out ! lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just could n't put the book down buy it have fun

things are going swimmingly in fish ! land in the latest volume fish ! tales authors stephen lundin john christensen harry paul and philip strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first fish book tales shows how four companies a call center a hospital unit a car dealership and a roofing company have applied fish ! theories effectively they also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the fish ! function the four main principles are familiar by now keep the work fun seek to serve others stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude but the examples in the book bring them alive along the way the authors heavily sell their fish ! courses and merchandise that 's just good salesmanship but the real catch of the day is the final section showing ways to apply these principles in any organization the lively writing style helps keep you hooked we suggest that if you have n't yet caught any fish ! start with this one its cheery accessible methods should lure you in hook line and sinker
while some may think that good work should be readable and enjoyable '' great work is meant to elevate us stun us amaze us fill us with wonder otherwise see spot run would be a masterpiece william faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again he is not only brilliant of word but of concept he creates a picture not only by text but by context and form in many ways his works sculpt how else would we see things from the vistas of the characters especially those who ca n't speak but by setting and demonstration one reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by using big words '' writing is the art of language interplay the use of beautiful and succinct language faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it
the reviewers above and below warn that the novel is difficult to read if you a person of average intelligence all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written it 's an incredibly easy read the second time around the sound and the fury is a summation of faulkner 's works everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in the sound and the fury the sound and the fury is poignant and tragic it is monumental in its mythical power it is southern and yet it is universal it is faulkner 's triumph as a novelist it is a study of human consciousness perception and existence the novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the compson family in faulkner 's world of yoknapatawpha county the compsons and sartorises the sutpens and de spains in other words the established old families of jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical snopes portraits of the modern businessman ascended to power the story is an intimate portrayal of the compsons and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy why is it the greatest novel ever written it takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by joyce and woolf in the movements of european modernism which it does better and with more purpose than joyce and woolf and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region the story is great and moving the characters are loveable hateable tragic and intensely vivid the place is conceived and presented with taxing reality the language as with all of faulkner 's novels is at times soaring and at times quite terse the structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of christ the three days are good friday holy saturday and easter sunday in short it is the paradigmatic example of what literature can and should do even the greatest of literary feats stand in its shadow

i really enjoyed this book i thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book there were some character changes and some additional characters in the book but i do n't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there i read the book after seeing the movie i always wondered what the movie had been based on i love baseball and i think the book was great
this novel is more enjoyable than the flanders panel but still not up to the level of the fencing master or his recent series the captain alatriste books the characters are well drawn the setting comes alive and the story flows there are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp but i can not tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original the only real disappointment came when i finished the book i wish there was a

people were looking for a book that could grab them about nam when this was a best seller in 1972 and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in nam itself as a primary consideration portions of this book originally appeared in new yorker ' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared frances fitzgerald 's original trip to vietnam was in february to november of 1966 and resulted in articles for the monthly ' the voice ' ' etc people who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like nam where large numbers of young americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion this book is not perfect the only listing for gulf resolution ' in the index is for the page on which president johnson 's use of the resolution is questioned by senator fulbright in 1966. that was the time this book is mainly concerned with but it gives an enormous amount of background information it is possible to find a listing in the index under gvn ' for entry into the war 354 ' which gives the page that reflects secretary of defense robert mcnamara 's testimony to congress that '' it was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by gvn forces that north vietnamese pt boats attacked the destroyer maddox mistaking it for one of the south vietnamese vessels '' pp actually the oplan attacks along the gulf of tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in washington and mcnamara lied about south vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of operations during which the north vietnamese pt boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when american intelligence informed the maddox that it was about to be attacked radio intercepts of north vietnamese naval messages on august 4 1964 were used to convince lbj and senators that an attack had occurred when two american destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a rudder as shown by subsequent tests edwin moise 's book tonkin gulf and the escalation of the vietnam war has much more information about that secret circus stunt jeffrey kimball 's recent book the vietnam war files uncovering the secret history of strategy contains a reference to the author of this book in a memorandum by dwight chapin to haldeman january 18 1973 about a month after heavy bombing near or in hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed hoping it could be called peace announcement ' 288 and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting the fitzgeralds and the fondas the halberstams and harrimans the clarks and ellsbergs and baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast '' kimball 291 i have the first vintage books edition august 1973 which was after dwight chapin 's memorandum but i am not sure if american bombing in cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on there are only six lines of listings in the index for cambodia mostly on general issues but the week i spent there was hardly of more interest to me was the report in fire in the lake about the an lao valley where the battalion infantry from the infantry division spent the months from september 1969 to january 1970. i believe this was our first free fire zone with a base high above a village that had been destroyed surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides enemy contact was the only kind we had after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book in operation wing alone a sweep through the north of binh dinh province the allied forces by the estimates destroyed an entire enemy division in the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and ' so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile an loa valley '' 405 while the american troops opened roads and ' great stretches of territory the front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by troops by the end of 1966 the nlf continued to govern the an lao valley as well as the suburbs of da nang hue nha trang and saigon '' 406 there is only one line in the index for frantz fanon but anyone who is interested in how fitzgerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in african and arab countries and the situation in nam including the belief in fate and the symbolic killing of self which he called behavior patterns of avoidance the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities the tribal warfare and the fierce irrational feuding of the native sects as he explained them '' you would n't want to believe how true the stuff in this book could be today
this was the very first jonathan kellerman book i had ever read this is by far the best one he ever wrote i do n't think that i have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful it 's like watching a top notch movie this has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone i still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now i give this book a star rating
those interested in american art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book chicago and new york are the centers from which katharine kuh radiated as a museum curator art dealer and published critic she was personally close to many of the modern masters in this book she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives i especially liked the chapters on rothko tobey and noguchi disparate side characters such as judge learned hand and lbj pop up and add further to the value of kuh 's memoir avis berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century american art by completing the memoirs of katharine kuh the author 's reflections have been preserved in a form while still true to the author that is likely better than had the elderly kuh herself remained alive to complete the job notes to the text and a more complete description of katharine kuh 's personal background are some of the very work accomplished by berman
if you 're an easily offended religious fanatic who 's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs i guess you should n't read this actually you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels but if you 're anyone else of any age who enjoys a really awesome story with great characters adventure danger fantastic visual writing and not a single boring moment well it might take a little effort to get past the beginning but that 's coming from a really impatient reader then yeah go for it because there 's just nothing that compares

if i were to choose the two best novels by this author they would be the nautical chart and the queen of the south the fencing master by comparison is n't as lively or as intellectually thrilling but it is a chewy read i particularly loved the characterization of don jaime as an older man realizing what he has lost in his life
most people are in awe of the classic '' however a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition classics do not only thrill and teach they also live the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas is a classic this tale of accusal love betrayal imprisonment redemption and retribution defies genre recounting the plot serves no purpose so i will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward edmond dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him he expected to return to those who remained faithful here dumas using dantes sinbad albert and abbe busoni championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life the count of monte cristo is a vivid potrayal of french life after the revolution an epic account of a man 's quest for closure and an inspiration for the shawshank redemption it is never too late to read it
at 37 john wade was lieutenant governor of minnesota at 40 he ran for the senate he was heavily favored to win at 41 he was n't just beaten in the primary he was crushed loser by landslide '' what happened john wade had a secret as secrets will it came out at the worst possible time and suddenly he was no longer a rising star he was a war criminal a killer of babies a man to be shunned his secret was my lai the vietnam war is now so far from us and american history especially the history of a war we lost is so sketchily taught and some of you are so very young that i really ought to take a minute here and in quick brushstrokes relate what happened in a little vietnam village on march 16 1968. better idea let tim o'brien tell it he arrived in vietnam a year later and served as a foot soldier there for a year got wounded got traumatized the whole deal here 's his account at approximately on the morning a company of roughly 115 american soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of my lai they met no resistance no enemy no incoming fire still for the next four hours charlie company killed whatever could be killed they killed chickens they killed dogs and cattle they killed people too lots of people women infants old men the united states army 's criminal investigation division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent army inquiry led by lieut william peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400. at the son my memorial a large tablet lists 504 names according to william wilson one of the original army investigators the crimes visited on the inhabitants of son my village included individual and group acts of murder rape sodomy maiming assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees '' eventually after a that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines the army 's criminal investigation division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes of these only a single soldier first lieut william laws calley was ever convicted or spent time in prison found guilty of the premeditated murder of not less than '' 22 civilians calley was sentenced to life at hard labor but after legal appeals and sentence reductions his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison terrible terrible and ironic seymour hersh who broke the my lai story now writes about the iraq war for the new yorker but in fiction o'brien does n't play judge and jury john wade may have been at my lai and done terrible things there but he found a way to live with his shame and here 's the remarkable thing tim o'brien bends over backward to see it wade 's way what i tell you now may seem like a plot spoiler '' it 's not in the lake of the woods '' is a mystery maybe even a thriller but it 's totally innovative in form that is we know right off that something happened the first question is what happened and then a gloomier question who did it what we know after the primary defeat john wade and his wife kathy retreat to a cabin in the lake of the woods a part of northern minnesota so remote that there 's nothing but water and islands between it and canada hours later kathy disappears did she flee did she drown did her husband reliving his vietnam experience kill her and dump her body into the lake not easy questions and o'brien does n't answer them i tried to make each hypothesis plausible john may have killed kathy or kathy may have run off with someone else or maybe she simply drowned or got lost in that vast wilderness i believed in each hypothesis as i wrote it i inserted evidence to support each hypothesis just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things but in the end it 's all a mystery insoluble beyond certainty '' and to make it more mysterious o'brien tells the story from multiple perspectives offers testimony from many people cites historical documents and then amps up the uncertainly by giving wade a hobby magic and maybe that 's what it comes down to an ungainly kid an abusive father a need for approval that never got satisfied as o'brien writes '' a fat little kid doing magic in front of a mirror 'hey kiddo that 's a good one ' his father could 've said but for reasons unknown reasons mysterious the words never got spoken he had wanted to be loved and to be loved he had practiced deception he had hidden the bad things he had tricked up his own life only for love only to be loved '' too simple a clue that takes you away from the solution could be o'brien is that good he won the national book award for going after cacciato '' the new york times named the things they carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 and chose in the lake of the woods '' for that list four years later this much is sure you start in the lake of the woods '' expecting one kind of book and quickly get another darker scarier book you find yourself thinking god this is awful '' even as you read faster and faster you cringe at what wade might have done wince for what might have been done to him and as he comes apart so do you this is a harrowing book as as it gets it 's a great story masterfully told and more it draws you in demands your opinion and then it demands your honest opinion because you have your secrets too do n't you
an absolutely magnificent peice of literature ! the use of language is witty and funny and i have never experienced such joy from a collection of short stories before the ''is he deep '' introduction set the mood of the bok and that question played on mind throughout the entire read fantasti
robert barid 's exploration of history 's secret connections is brilliant by integrating hidden and not presented in any other book various facts of sciences he clearly shows that our ancestors had much deeper understanding of the reality than most of the modern people i had a chance to explore many other books by this author available from his page on the and i highly recommend all of them
the gospel of judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame it is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the christian faith like its many predecessors it gave national geographic and authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of jesus a book titled the gospel of judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly shot straight back down still while its popularity was it allowed bart ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of christ surely ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered the gospel of judas is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century it rivals the finding of the dead sea scrolls or the gnostic gospels of nag hammadi '' national geographic describes the importance of the document in this way the gospel of judas gives a different view of the relationship between jesus and judas offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed jesus unlike the accounts in the canonical gospels of matthew mark luke and john in which judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor this newly discovered gospel portrays judas as acting at jesus ' request when he hands jesus over to the authorities '' a classically dualistic gnostic document the gospel of judas presents a jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks judas to betray him so he can be free of this wickedness judas complies and shows himself to be a hero rather than a villain no longer the betrayer he is a faithful friend to jesus christ renowned new testament scholar wright is the first christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of the gospel of judas judas and the gospel of jesus is due for publication in october of 2006 and will be published by baker books it is a short book weighing in at only 144 pages but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter wright is fair to this newly published document he does not say that there is no value in the gospel of judas for surely there is for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early christianity it gives historians access to an authentic original document but it tells us nothing about the real jesus and the real judas those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real jesus can be little more than revisionists wright shows that such people believe in what he calls the new myth of christian origins '' this myth popularized by men such as bart ehrman has three main teachings first jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray him second there were a great many different varieties of early christianity and they produced a large number of different gospels '' all of which circulated among christians more or less unchecked third when christianity became consolidated in the fourth century many teachings about the true '' christian faith were rejected classic christianity '' he says has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new myth or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills it is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled so often to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess the gospel of jesus himself '' through this short book wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where the gospel of judas simply can not be held as equal in any way to scripture he shows himself to be a new testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel while the document appears to be genuine it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us even two millenia later it is perhaps somewhat ironic that wright who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of paul and thus jesus would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent jesus unfortunately wright 's new perspectives are glimpsed even if only dimly through much of the text of this book still he offers a compelling response to ehrman and others and one well worth reading i would tend to believe that for most people the gospel of judas is best ignored it offers little that would be of interest to the average person for those who do have interest in it judas and the gospel of jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent christianity and to cast doubt upon scripture
peter robinson is one of my favorite authors when i travel on vacation i make sure to take his latest novel piece of my heart '' transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago the characters were well developed and the story line moved there were many layers of that were interwoven i thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion

some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book although in fact it is not an easily readable book for the general public if you have a serious interest about the history of the third reich make no mistake you will not be able to overlook this book which will surely be a classic it is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism the interaction between the new '' domestic and international values based on aggression and the other causes involved in the rise and fall of the iii reich from a different perspective from other mainstream historians this winner of the samuel johnson prize for non fiction has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history no wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus new particularly well deserved of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian fuhrerprinzip

this rare book details aleister crowley 's ascension as the prophet of a new aeon the aeon of horus out of all the aleister crowley books in mass market format this stood out in memory years after i read it as one of crowley 's most disturbing works in fact i questioned my new faith in crowley 's religion thelema reading this book this was for real and not a joke after contemplating i thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today 's youth and crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today this is serious stuff i would n't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult it should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work i did a ritual from necronomicon and lesser key of solomon to help with a college astronomy i got a respectable c grade when i close to failing with a but be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism

twain 's account of his years on the mississippi is part travel book part memoir and part historical work with a few sketches stories and tall tales tossed in for good measure there is even an outtake from the huckleberry finn '' along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors this smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book but much of it shows mark twain at his humorous and humanistic best the kernel of the volume and its best most cohesive section is in chapters 4 through 17 this material appeared in the atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early his adventures as a young man are fraught with danger full of comedy populated by a number of ornery mischievous and reckless characters and occasionally embellished although twain is a bit obvious when he 's fobbing off a yarn as twain later wrote in puddn'head wilson if there was anything better in this world than steamboating it was the glory to be got by telling about it '' after he published the series in the atlantic twain added another 46 chapters much of it an account of his homecoming incognito or so he 'd hoped to the mississippi river in 1882 when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad many of these descriptions are unusually for twain melancholy he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous his new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion the material from other sources unfortunately tends to bog things down and there are about words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents he also included travel writing from earlier visitors primarily europeans distracted by how americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty you almost get the feeling that twain would have smacked the once renowned and vigorously hated '' frances trollope upside the head if he 'd had the chance she provides twain with the most interesting if snooty descriptions of traveling along the mississippi early in the century the material twain wrote however more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff as always he is quotable witty amusing and provocative in spite of its excesses nobody has done the mississippi better

how this book flew under the nation 's radar 'll ever know furthermore it 's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized this book plays out like a spielberg movie from page one very spielbergian because of it 's perfect blend of adventure romance and humor the characters are dynamic and interesting as hell the storyline is straight out of an indiana jones serial and it keeps building until you 're reading as fast as you possibly can just to see what happens the art work is astounding these are the heroes sexiest women and the most powerful looking baddies i 've ever seen penciled in my life it 's just a shame that this book is n't getting the buzz that crap like ultimate '' is getting in all reality this is the best graphic novel on the shelves right now could easily be the film adaptation that could return steven spielberg to greatness for once in a very long time i 'm truly blown away

always think twice never jump to hasty conclusions without considering all the effects of an act or decision that 's the essence of economics looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy '' most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson as henry hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book are there benefits in destruction let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble can taxes benefit the economy of a country do inflationary policies really encourage a economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions are all labor union practices truly justified and what about tariffs subsidies parity prices rent control or minimum wage laws these are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear read or see on the media beyond what you may think about the government 's role in the economy whether you agree or not with the author 's liberal views economics in one lesson '' shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees as the author points out presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies demagogues and 'rogue ' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision or in the worst cases on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action learning to supplement and correct their with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do btw economics in one lesson '' might be a good place to
i found this in the church library but it is not christian fiction it is simply an easy read the story is sweet made even sweeter by the topic cake i am not even much of a cake person i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of etc but as i read i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator i do n't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet the need for sweets will be simply overpowering
overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a do the mix of recipes is fine but they just seemed to be missing something they were all more or less of the huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done '' variety all of the recipes look tasty though i would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes especially some more creative ones let 's be honest when you pay for a book you 'd like to see more than put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated dutch oven salt and pepper to taste cook until done '' give me a little something to work with here ! inspire me ! i can already cook a roast like this in the oven having said all of that i would still reccommend this book the vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and i ca n't wait to try some of them as an aside this is the only dutch oven book i 've seen with recipes as well as more traditional fare given that the average do book requires the use of a metric ton of lard this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks

john gunther 's inside comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get hurling us back to the america of 1947 as he explores state by state the people politics issues passions and fads that make up our country written with great energy and insight gunther captures an america justly proud of its wwii success still unsure of its role in the world and populated by fascinating characters like mayor laguardia of new york governor saltonstall of massachusetts and boss hague of jersey city gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today he captures aspects of america that are gone l never to return an industrial '' nation based on coal iron ore and steel and he foresees issues that dog america to this day the negro problem '' actually the white problem '' he condemns the segregationist society he finds in america so inconsistent with its lofty ideals as you can tell i loved this book it 's very hefty but every time you are about to put it down gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading all this said gunther does concentrate on the a historical b political and c economic side of things you wo n't find much here about the arts or science but it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly
