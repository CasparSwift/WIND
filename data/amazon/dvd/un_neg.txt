the only good thing in this movie was howard 's performance she is innocent and believable i ca n't understand how good actors like weaver hurt and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this the 'plain ' dialogue among the 'elders ' is painfully numbing choppy and stilted and the directing drove me crazy especially since night insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through or following them without ever bothering with these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera if you like the back of william hurt 's head you 'll get plenty of it in this film the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague which is too bad since when he finally has a good speech we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes i agree with others i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode rent it first before you buy and save some money for a classic thriller like psycho
this movie is the most boring uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever wasted my money on the plot is stupid the characters are dull and insipid and the whole movie leaves you asking as the credits run so what '' do n't waste your money !
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
i knew the ending within the first 10 minutes night shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at denny's
i 'm not reviewing the show itself but rather the colorization if you 've seen the show you know whether you like it if you have n't seen it you can read the many other reviews the show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously but if i 'm bothered by the colorization it must be really bad unless you like jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they 've drunk a bottle of ink skip this version and get the bw set then you wo n't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i did n't see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i 'll give it another chance '' bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that 's about as boring as this movie so why the markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time
my daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and do n't like it they also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it my 9 old especially likes the tae bo better i bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout but they do n't want to do this one at all i thought they would and i 'm sure as the other reviews have stated love it but they did n't i guess it just depends on the child
incredible does describe this incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi '' or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she 's only worthy of miss congeniality '' type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
for those of you whose children grew up with conjunction junction '' and other grammar rock songs it is probably time for you to buy this dvd set for your grandkids ! this collection has all of the songs that you remember and probably some that you do n't ! i recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see i do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it it was quite difficult to navigate simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer i really give this product 5 stars the 2 star rating was an accident that i ca n't remedy
if you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child pass on this one this movie has so many drug references i ca n't even begin to explain trust me i just so happen to have taken acid before this is a movie that never should have been directed toward children if you want your child to be drug free when grows up do not buy this
bone collector upon the opening scene of the movie i was highly upset it was only after the movie had begun that i realized i did n't buy a porn c'mon ! bone collector ! that was a clever little marketing ruse you did there universal nice one you wo n't get me again it 's a thriller with angelina jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles nuts and bolts and jigsaw puzzles this guy is so smart he could probably beat ken jennings in jeopardy he even has an awesome magical straw that controls one of those beds he can make the bed recline with a magic straw ! ! unfortunately he did n't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of jolie who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses clues comic books and ancient steam pipes leading to a surprise ending in which everything is perfect and butterflies land on retarded kids ' heads only there are a few major 1 there is no way that jolie would have switched departments 2 there is no way that washington would have had that much pull 3 there is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with 4 the clues that are so cleverly figured out do n't even lead to figuring out who the killer is things learned from this movie o'neill is more versatile than the al bundy role sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an arab guy hate the fact that queen latifah a person as talented as a stick of butter has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity the fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now leave in the end it 's a mediocre movie from which i expected more given the combo of washington and jolie there really should have been greatness it 's a preposterous renter at best
this movie is just so tragically that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it good cast but what stupidity in the script are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is crimes from an almost old novel and so angelina jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure duhhh the place has been abandoned for decades more you mean to tell me a real estate developer has n't snatched up the property and razed the building that it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later i 'm sorry when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this i bail on the whole project
apparently this is one of those cult '' movies that has a small but dedicated following even though most people have never heard of it nothing wrong with that but be aware that the reviews you 'll read here are from a very skewed sample of movie fans i love good comedy and so does my wife but both of us found this movie terminally dull it 's basically a movie the joke being that the people in it the characters not the actors are totally untalented but also totally oblivious to that fact so they just keep on doing their unfunny bits waiting for guffman '' does not appear on the american film institute 's list of 100 funniest movies nor is it on the imdb list of 50 top comedies as rated by thousands of movie fans so anyone who tells you this movie is the funniest movie ever '' or hilarious '' is definitely out of the mainstream i 'll give guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path the format has the potential to be funny but in this mess of a movie it does n't work very well there are some funny bits david cross is always a stitch but too much of it just falls flat it feels like something that would have worked on snl as a sketch but as a movie it just crawls ok i 've said my piece and i 'm sure that i 'll get lots of not helpful '' ratings from the movie 's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title but if you 're not a fan of slow dry improvisational movies be warned you wo n't find waiting for guffman '' very amusing
horrible family you care nothing for and nobody you 'd want in your own and that 's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her hell i really want to slap everyone on the cast crew and the writers i bought this for 5 bucks and it was n't worth 5 cents these people are unsympathetic unbelievable and totally made up the women wear too much and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs i bought the movie because of johnathan schaech based okay on his pretty face and his presence in that thing you do but he 's not even in it that much he 's better looking than all the girls in it too including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when alyssa dumps her i fast forwarded through this after the first half pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made dumb and dumber look like hemingway in summation if you like this movie you have been dumbed down by the evil hollywood machine and i suggest you check out good foreign films like a good marriage and beautiful scandals like valmont immediately there is no excuse for liking unmoving plastic dreck of this nature
character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device however in most such efforts there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones we found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters even the bride who is supposed to carry the film seemed fake and unlikeable we watched about 20 minutes of this dvd and ditched it in favor of something else for a much better quirky family '' movie wait for the family stone '' to come out on dvd
we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch can anyone say buzz and woody chicken run the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story 2. how many times can you do the joke worse still is the dialogue the painfully unfunny and the animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another and that once again we see a lack of locations or interest there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest this film is a piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry
after about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the warm up '' otherwise they will be very frustrated it is very fast very complicated well choregraphed but even the break it down '' segment moves at double speed
my 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with i think it is best for those with a dance background the music is good though
i wish i had read the other reviews before i purchase this dvd it is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all you are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly even the break down '' section of the dvd is impossible to follow very disappointing
fun to watch but my 9 old daughter could not follow the moves neither could i for that matter we tried to learn the moves through breaking it down '' but there is just not enough repetition too complicated
i 'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning the dialogue especially a lot of sebastion 's lines was really witty and smart but somewhere near the climax the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie that really disappointed me i was hoping for something a little more than that and spoiler what also really disappointed me about this movie was when annette lost her virginity her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable ! it would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin
every review i 've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and i just do n't get it no one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it and by then you 're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next if you like extremely broad slapstick humor and find that totally charming then i guess i can see the appeal everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases i have to wonder what they could be damned melon ! '' or i passed out when i broke my wrist and when i woke up the cast was already on ! '' i will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor because they say completely different things or omit speech altogether in sum do n't waste your time
terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid
the total absence of normative values makes for tedium and revulsion not for greatness nor even for that matter for titillation when even incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference it becomes easy to see why the french are exterminating themselves by refusing to reproduce themselves at the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family the french nation will be gone in another few generations this movie will help the viewer see why sociologically and philosphically interesting in that it epitomizes the banality of evil and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig secularism is devoid of soul and offers nothing to live for nothing to live by
this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women '' is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all 5 inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women '' is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are and fun there 's dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man 's vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife catherine deneuve and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the mark i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience
this really did n't help me understand the mind of lesbians it was poorly written or acted or presented or something i was looking for insight to try and gain appreciation for the lifestyle so that i could better understand the culture but was left with a silly sex movie very disappointed i regret the purchase should have gotten rent instead
the acting was very good the pace was adequate however the plot was predictable the movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome clive 's character kept calling this the perfect robbery the characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters ca n't possibly know what is going on i 'm still not sure what jody foster 's character brings to the plot any way they do stupid things the bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet you do n't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie however they do call it a s thole during the movie they spent hours on this hole why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine they even brought buckets in with them they were disguised as painters why could n't clive 's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel furthermore the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag i have to be honest i did n't guess the ending i kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues for example a big one is the title of the movie however the lame clues the s thole acted like red herrings they threw me off the scent
george sluizer 's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes ' plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they do n't even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they 're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 's end on a joke like a tv cop show ' moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one
why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd seriously the child of a masterpiece the vanishing '' sports some of the most performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90 's this is n't a matter of comparison this movie all by itself just sucks if i had n't seen the original i 'd just think what a brilliant plot too bad they decided to bury it no pun intended with everything else in the movie '' jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great gut wrenchingly disturbing hitchcockian 1988 movie sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves which add nothing to the movie and the ending oh the ending we 've been cheated totally cheated all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of it has to be upbeat ! '' hollywood cornball syndrome sandra bullock is rescued the villain is hit with a shovel and everything is ! even though kiefer sutherland 's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated this is of a great movie
unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
i ca n't write a review because i had to send both cd 's back because they would not play i just ordered another one yesterday and here 's hoping that will be okay
the cd was great and extra scenes on the cd were really good however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen cd and i would have bought another ! so i wasted 21.00 as i have a hd tv but not wide screen
wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself wo n't enjoy two womanizers fall in love one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin like first off what does virginity have to do with love second who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin then owen wilson 's character fall in love with rachel 's mcadams character and well that 's the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it 's not that funny it seems to think it 's better then it is i do n't think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive '' gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course because it 's this kind of film he ends up being gay and of course he tries to hit on vince vaughn 's character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay '' guy is prob one of the worst actors i 've seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell alot of people i know find this guy so '' funny but i do n't get it it just was n't funny to me u know i loved the classic american pie '' that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy ! this film was n't so much funny as stupid for the most part i 'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it 's just an average film
i 've been told by many people that this show was an american monty python while it is slightly better than snl bob odenkirk the of this series rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at snl so this show was the result it still is n't particularly funny the only sketches i liked were the burger '' commercial in season one the iguana sketch odenkirk plays an iguana very well and the jesus christ superstar parody is really good though not particularly funny just well shot and edited it feels almost like a tribute but other sketches drag on and on particularly the infomercial parody and many feel forced the repartee between cross and odenkirk does n't really work well either i tried to get into this show but just could n't sorry
i want the two hours of my life back ! after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973. that time is past even then the robots attack people '' concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american cinema or you are in your and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated !
the setting of this film is in the late just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be artistic '' in his craft heather graham plays his and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is 's just say endowed wahlberg 's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of wahlberg 's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes although i do n't know if the would admit as much at any rate he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his package '' this hubris leads to his as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie well it could have been but all the way through there seems to be something missing there are times the film seems '' to try and convey a message but i 'm not really sure one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i 've never cared for wahlberg he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt also i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered given the context of the film one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women that 's simply not the case in the end however the biggest problem of this movie is n't wahlberg or the lack of nudity the difficulty is that it 's just plain boring i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn and yet this flick failed to grab me
i give the dvd a 1 star not the movie just to let you guys know about a new disc set coming out finally this morning disney has delayed the dvd release of the crimson tide unrated extended edition from to no word as to why
i watched the film in the theater when it came out was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies trying to entertain '' educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best the pet dog was cute but also unrealistic the book the gold crew '' had a more believable plot having served on a few ballistic missile submarines i find it an insult to the crews of the boats especially to the captains and officers it 's understandable why the navy refused to bless this by placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen which it could n't as depicted too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it from november 15 25 2001. the navy completed 3500 deterrent patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch and there still out there boring holes in the water
i really felt like i had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build a close friendship to a romantic relationship the guys do n't even display a close friendship at the beginning how are they gon na jump from a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building '' to hot and heavy ca n't live without each other love '' it 's not believable and does n't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene and from there they are suddenly in love and fact there is no indication that either character is gay until that mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time or even was interested in guys in general but as i said before the movie does n't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here are n't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are highly overrating if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and you 're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay somewhere is not the movie
it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification this is a very dull shapeless stilted movie i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds but since it is above all a piece of propaganda i 'm compelled to condemn it as history what it presents is the war between the states '' version of the civil war in which the gallant southerners defend their homes their beloved hills and dales their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north there are only two black characters both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters otherwise slavery is beside the point the generalship of lee and jackson of course is idolized while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools the battle scenes are perfectly predictable guys charge on foot other guys shoot the fields are littered with bodies would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting how real is it to show only one train and that southern in a war won more by transportation than by musketry if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy scholarly book arguing about slavery by william lee miller a professor at the university of virginia it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives over slavery in the years before the election of lincoln the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides blue and grey
it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame it was a mistake to take stephen lang and put him in the role of jackson jackson was considered even by his contemporaries a military genius but crazy by half the film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be shakespearean the prayer scene in the morning puke ! it could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene most of the women '' folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded and i hate to say it but i was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever i was glad to be rid of her her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor i get it jackson was such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual '' give me a break i hate being force feed like that a better director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly then there is chamberlain quoting shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares there is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film i would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been a narrative like gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige if you must see it borrow it rent it but do n't waste money buying it unless it is in the 3 bin at the local dirtmart gettysburg is much better i actually missed sheen and i hate that guy
i just got through watching this dmytryk film on tcm tonight and all i can say is that if you are looking for the george peppard who played paul varjak in breakfast at tiffany 's forget it in fact he is so cold and so stiff i realize he 's trying to play a nasty howard hughes knockoff that a cardboard figurine would have been just as convincing in his stead outside of great costumes and sets this movie is long and boring where it 's not boring it 's a snicker inducing raunchfest poor alan ladd in his final role barely having to act as he plays a drunken hasbeen and elizabeth ashley who is the only redeeming character in the entire plot and also resembles audrey hepburn to a scary degree in the last half of this debacle carroll baker may be sexy in her lingerie but she 's so with her heavy breathing and her lingerie that you actually want to cheer when her car goes off the road i can think of better ways to pass my time for 2 and hours than this like watching the mating rituals of underwear still you just ca n't stop watching it through to its unrealistic ending if i 'd have thought beating up one of my old flames after years of his acting like a total jag would have changed him overnight i 'd have done it long ago ! if you must see this lousy piece of 60 's smut make sure you rent it or come across it on tv before you go buying it i 've seen corpses that are more convincing than peppard was in this flick !
this overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish it does n't work as good trash or as high camp edward dmytryk directs harold robbins ' source material with a lead foot george peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on the '' alan ladd who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit essentially sleepwalks through this picture it 's equally unfortunate that talented actors like carroll baker elizabeth ashley and martin balsam are associated with this swill heck i even feel bad for former boxing champ archie moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy the film 's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by edith head the women 's lingeree in particular if you must waste 150 minutes of your time it 's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow
how dumb movies can get then again maybe i was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film just to give you fair warning matt the main character is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film matt decides to get rid of sex for lent because of a bad in his endeavor he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life most of the film involves matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen no joke ! not only are his friends hormone induced morons but nosier than girls to boot ! one of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public which led to a whole new series of taunting since this film is full of stereotypes i rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they 're angry because matt 's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in they irritated me a bit can you tell however as bad as most of the guys in this film are the girls are n't any better apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated matt and never got what they deserved first there 's nicole the one who dumped matt when she hears of his vow she decides she wants him back refuses to take no for an answer then rapes him yes rapes him later in the film when he 's handcuffed to a bed and asleep nice girl is n't she matt 's new love interest erica is not much better throughout the film she yells at him and throws tantrums like a for no good reason first she gets mad because he did n't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for lent she pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her why because he had n't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met they were n't even a couple yet ! rather than realizing that she 's a guy 's worst nightmare and running for the hills he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her her dumbest moment was later in the film when she did n't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him you 'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would 've tipped her off ! again he 's the one who apologizes why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from normally i 'm not this scathing in my reviews but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness not recommende
maybe for some people to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal but in matt sullivan 's case it could be a total nightmare after his girlfriend nicole leaves him matt spends about six months devouring girls until he starts to hallucinate advised by his brother matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems and proposes to go through lent without sex for matt 's friends this odyssey is as absurd as impossible and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last matt 's abstinence he does n't have it easy as many temptations will make him suffer and even smell the possibility of a new love 40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character in a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love oh what a shocking discovery !
for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this 0 stars the infamous fake o '' scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable one of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with just fyi
i could n't get into this movie it was boring too long and i could n't wait for it to be over with george was annoying and he should 've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo the only thing i liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning
it 's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick clean minimalist thriller it 's not that much of the added material particularly the internal affairs feels and unnecessary it 's not even that pacino 's character is a shell of the dangerously detective of the original that one of the more complicated characters frya francke has been reduced down to set dressing or that the ending ruins the film 's moral atmosphere it 's the fact that nolan a sublimely talented director is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads pacino does the bit again taking it over the top in every single scene hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the hometown girl and robin williams well he 's robin williams the kids in this film katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson turn in fine performances that while hardly which they could n't be considering how far their roles have been pared down are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries ' mugging see the film for their performances but make sure you rent it and do n't pay too much to do so
i give this version 2 stars 1 for natalie wood who is superb and 1 for the story itself rosiland russell who was a great actress auntie mame the women but definately not a singer is miscast big time ! ! if they had done the right thing and cast ethel merman the combination of merman and natalie wood would make this a classic today which it definately is not the bette midler version is far superior
i hate lawyers what is a lawyer anyway basically it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an class womb shakespeare said it first and best first let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' former enron john wing put a little houston spin on that one get all the lawyers in a room shoot 'em ! the mouth so you miss ! '' exactly anyway the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of yappers exciting so i was probably all amped up to despise it but not really back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater i briefly considered going into law briefly for about an hour it was a desperate time and i needed money why did i consider walking hell 's highway if only for an instant because john grisham boring a kind of tom clancy for the and set made it all sound pretty damned funky and lucrative ! hey dig that bmw 7 series baby beep beep ! in his engrossing little novel the firm '' granted i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes but it held my attention i mean seriously you 're 19 and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool and strippers man plenty of strippers oh and did someone mention a bmw what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your now it 's true grisham writes like kim jong il sings but the firm '' anyway was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace from the pedestrian law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis law firm the pretty damned atrocious all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense suffocating sense of malice grisham like michael crichton is n't a prose genius he 's not even mediocre but he writes for film and the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment so it 's baffling that with all the right stuff cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere gene hackman doing his gene hackman thang as the corrupt but ultimately and pathetic senior partner and sydney pollack helming it up the treatment of the firm '' is such a yawner talk about contempt of court pollack takes all that intricately woven little and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen at its guts really the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare i 've bet the farm on this gig i 'm getting big money i 'm working like a fiend my wife is having trouble remembering my name and evidently i 'm not doing for loaded clients 'm doing money laundering for the mob pollack just mangles the whole thing convolutes the simple and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning casting is part of the problem cruise does his thing running around memphis with his briefcase hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure sleaze the firm '' is all when he 's onscreen but hey a man can only do so much jeanne tripplehorn cruise 's squeeze who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn seriously google the two of 'em astounding ! is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief too bald too cracker too rotund too silly too to do the role justice holly hunter is even worse hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy which is baffling given that she 's about and has all the sex appeal of an it does n't help that she 's a big ugly southern stereotype the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be you want her to die she does n't pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny she is n't ed harris i think is in this movie so is hal holbrook which kinda ruins everything because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks anyway the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance deus ex machina of paul sorvino don morolto kind of goombah name is dat anyway somebody call tony soprano ! who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours by all means belly up to the bar otherwise case dismissed js
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents if you do try it with captions it was fun funny and a nice when one needs a lift
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i did n't see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i 'll give it another chance '' bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that 's about as boring as this movie so why the markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time
do n't watch click if you 're in the mood for a comedy the middle of the film is miserable of course it has a hollywood happy ending the comedy bits are ok but few and far between if click had been marketed as a drama this would be less of a problem the story line has some great life lessons without giving away too much the morals of this movie are 1. put family first 2. do n't wish your life away but enjoy every minute of it even the mundane for driving home those lessons click has some value it is also great to see adam sandler do well in a dramatic role he has more range than you might imagine but there 's something very unsatisfying about watching click that 's not fixed by the ending or the few bits of pranks and smartass jokes in short it 's a mediocre film
i had heard that this film was really funny '' and worth watching '' i 'm not a big adam sandler fan but i am a fan of kate beckinsale and christopher walken i was sorely disappointed with this film the audience ca n't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating i was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they did n't i also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him overall click was ok kate beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it i would not recommend buying this film
acting 5 out of 10 walken gets all 5 points directing -3 out of 10 movie with coraci no more please 3 out of 10 bed bath and beyond the only savior comedy rating -4 out of 10 come on sandler will make you laugh atleast a couple of times quality -4 out fo 10 70 million and i see grain total score 19 out of 50 grade violence mostly comical nothing nasty nudity sex none language high one f'bomb lots more of the rest overall teens will love it specially the younger ones i have enjoyed many a adam sandler movie happy gilmore is still one of the funniest movies ever and the waterboy will always be one of my favorite comedies as well but he sure missed here if not for the amazing sensational and hilarious christopher walken this would have been a total bomb the jokes he makes at sandler 's expense are and it 's a shame he was n't in the movie alot more sandler big time and when he tries to get you to cry for him well i 'd just about had enough by then granted you will laugh a few times this is adam sandler and for the most part the man is a comic genius i 'd just wish he would have made either a comedy or a drama not both but what really and i mean really dragged this movie down was the complete and total waste of one kate beckinsale this is one of the hottest sexiest fiery women in film today and she looked absolutely lost in this if selene see 's this she is gon na kick kate square in the booty for wasting her time with this drew berrymore would have been perfect for the role and who knows might have improved it even littl
the film why we fight i believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize america i felt that the movie only told one side of the argument and that side was clearly not the film portrays the united states as a power hungry nation which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world the film constantly criticizes the decisions of america leaders to engage into foreign combat the film however does not present an alternative solution it fails to take into consideration that america may be acting out of self defense the film constantly criticizes america for engaging in combat throughout the world what i have to say to the director of this film is is it not alright to defend your nation after terrorist drive planes into two buildings killing people is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots who are looking to destroy your way of life is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the middle east by toppling a murderous dictator when i see these questions i have to answer no to all of them i feel that if america feels threatened it should not have to seek permission to defend itself president bush put it properly i feel when he stated after the chaos and carnage of september it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers '' and america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people '' this film can criticize america and label it as a bully nation but these terrorist must be brought to justice president eisenhower once said peace and justice are two sides of the same coin '' as the most powerful nation in the world it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world it is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as americans sometimes take for granted since when has it become wrong to defend your nation why must america be criticized for engaging in conflict when it feels threatened is it not the job of the president of the united states to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack america again if they are given the chance we can never let our guard down freedom does not come free on september 11 2001 we saw firsthand how evil those who want to destroy us can be you can not negotiate with these types of people the only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force on the morning of the september 11 2001 attacks president bush stated that freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended '' indeed freedom was and is being defended and i see nothing wrong with that words are not enough to protect our nation president theodore roosevelt said great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind but great actions speak to all mankind '' and our great action will be to defend this great nation in the words of president hoover freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity '' and it is america 's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom remember words without actions are the assassins of idealism '' herbert hoove
the ideas behind 15 minutes are n't bad at all take one robert deniro put him in new york mix him with some hunting eastern europeans on a killing spree and try to provoke some emotions and have a sly dig at the american justice system lets see nothing happened only repulse if like everyone else you plan on watching this film because deniro is in it you will be dissapointed he puts in a tired performance almost as if he knows the film is a load of the attempt to be goes horribly wrong instead it 's just repulsive over the top violence and its pointless naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces why there are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning such as the horrible subject of snuff movies meaningfull film 15 minutes is far from meaningfull we all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that but when converting it to a film it needs a deeper meaning otherwise it turns into melodramatic hollywood if you like gore and violence lack of plot and cringing melodrama go ahead
three problems with this film 1. pacing the film 's pacing does n't vary it 's very boring as a matter of fact this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense speed '' however this film lacks the intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed 2. effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror '' scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting 3. triviality the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the so what '' question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that '' in light of points 1 and 2 this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake do n't waste your life alon

editorial reviews essential video after initially rejecting the role as too sentimental ginger rogers found the title character of kitty foyle to be an oscar winner and a career breakthrough released in 1940 only a year after her partnership with fred astaire ended kitty foyle helped establish rogers as a nonmusical star the film portrays a working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from mark james craig a kindly but humble doctor as soon as she accepts however she receives a different proposition this one from her former love wealthy socialite wyn dennis morgan who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in south america kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable kitty who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status did she really deserve the best actress oscar over bette davis in the letter joan fontaine in rebecca katharine hepburn in the philadelphia story and martha scott in our town well evidently rogers had moxie too david horiuchi product description known for light comedies and her partnership with fred astaire ginger rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940 's oscar spotlight with her best actress turn as kitty an indomitable girl who endures the rejection of philadelphia society makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with main line scion wynnewood strafford vi dennis morgan or marriage to a struggling physician james craig rogers ' deserved academy award confirmed she was more than a dance star a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails jane wyman won the best actress academy award for her sensitive portrayal of belinda capturing the girl 's affecting isolation awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph directed by jean negulesco and lew ayres charles bickford and agnes moorehead all four oscar for their fine work johnny belinda nominated for a total 11 oscars including best picture blends atmosphere nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi
i had heard all the hype about this film and ginger 's oscar but after several viewings i still find the film rather flat as an experience and ginger 's oscar is still a mystery i guess it proves the adage about winning one for women play plain or ugly remember charlize theron or play against type ''
i 'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really was n't much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap '' you 'd expect from a family friendly movie though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just does n't do comedy all that well at least for a lead role jame garner the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character although the cast is a powerhouse on paper sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball an example there was a sequence when bret asks his friends who are standing behind him to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting which as it turns out they are unable to do instead jodie and james blow madly just like the movie this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like ''the three amigo 's '' on paper you would think it could n't miss but on film it 's painful to watch
i 'm sure this was a fun video in its time but the moves are just too
waste of money waste of time cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film 's incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts ' character his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is godless and emotionally false it 's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts ' passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant 's reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in because it 's so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you 'll be sorry you did
this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96 ' but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television note 's this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she 's to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this
this is n't as good as spritied away or princess mononoke it 's not a bad film but it did n't capture me as well as the other films did
i was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and ghibli studios previous works all the greater the disappointment then when less than half way through the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original several key characters are lumped together most confusingly and others lose all their complex charm what a shame if you have never read the book and are a fan of miyazaki by all means buy this you 're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him if you are a fan of the book steer well clear you 're likely to want to poke miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head
i purchased this dvd because i own the one and like it so much boy was i disappointed ! the abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit the second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form skip this one and buy the abs diet workout 2
a more apt description of this video would be the floozie workout '' if you are a woman and serious about fitness be prepared to be insulted by the two floozies featured with tom holland on this exercise video who provide unnecessary comic relief in this otherwise solid weight training workout video the video is intended to provide a circuit training program to complement the abs diet a diet developed and promoted by david zinczkenko of men'shealth magazine the diet details of which i wo n't elaborate on here is a solid one and in many respects resembles the weight watcher core program it emphasizes a balance of protein healthy fat and complex carbs eaten in moderate portions the video provides three tracks one for the absolute beginner a second for intermediates and a third for those more advanced frankly the advanced track is not all that advanced if you are interested in weight training and have no experience be sure to consult your physician before starting an exercise program i suggest you start with the beginner circuit after several weeks when you feel confident you should be able to tackle the intermediate circuit and shortly thereafter the advanced circuits if you are looking for a serious weight training workout you should strongly consider jari love 's get ripped '' workout more rigorous emphasizes tempo training and grows with you many variations other than merely increasing the weight the video opens with a very short cardio workout and then segues into the beginner 's workout holland introduces each exercise and then takes the viewer through one set of he is accompanied by two women who carry very light weights and go through the motions if you truly want to make this a circuit you need to repeat the exercise circuit at least once if not twice the intermediate and advanced circuits feature the same basic exercises as in the beginner circuit but take it up a notch '' by adding light weight to some exercises and in the advanced doing double duty on others upper body if you are in any kind of shape you will probably benefit the most by combining all three circuits sequentially as cued on the video the whole workout will take less than one hour do n't expect abs though if you want abs you really need to watch your diet eat really clean and do some serious core work and this workout just does n't have it
i love to dance so i was excited to get this ! ! what a boring dvd ! ! did not sweat ! ! hated her complicated moves ! ! ! ! ! she is pretty but not motivating kids and i just sat on the couch and watched it thinking any minute it would pick up the beat ! i thought it would have real spanish latin and reggae songs and dancing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no way it was just some beat and these girls all doing step to side then to front hands up now to the side bla bla bla we expected upbeat motivating songs with lots of dancing and fun cancelled my order for all my other prevention dvd 's on the way for fear they would all be like this ! ! ! ! incidentally i tried pick your spot pilates '' from some other girl and it was not alot of music or dance mostly floor excercise but it worked and had me wanting more i blew my money on this thinking it would be motivating and give me some cardio to go along with the floor workout pick your spot '' are better off turning on the radio and jumping
along with the nanny the stepdad the cable guy the girl with a crush we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes everyone is out to get or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe i am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality no wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion mistrust fear and the resulting isolation when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us yes films like these have their place however i think hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality
not worth it only for interested in conspiracy theory looniness thoroughly one sided but that would be ok if it were n't riddled with inaccuracies that paul knew nothing of jesus ' ministry and never quotes anything jesus said any new testament scholar sees paul 's view of jesus as fitting hand in glove with what is in the gospels and acts though paul has his own emphases language and theological framework this joker i mean thinks that paul literally never believed that jesus was a real human living on earth geez he could at least read the books paul wrote ! the manages to assemble a few crank phds largely from fields outside of biblical studies who think that the gospels and acts were either meant as fiction from the beginning or else simply ridiculously innaccurate attempts at telling the truth oh and there 's the guy from the fringe notorious jesus seminar '' do you find the following sorts of arguments convincing the jesus story has elements x y and so does the story of hercules but no one takes the hercules story to be true ! and elements a n of the jesus story can each or in be found in various of these 26 legends so if you do n't spot any fallacious reasoning in the preceding this is the documentary for you ! the production values are pretty good cheapie old footage aside though intellectually the whole thing feels like a sort of college film class project made by a village atheist '' type who revels in cheap shots about those fundies who are no doubt going to sieze power any day now a interview and objections born of misunderstanding thinking that evangelicals want an style theocracy with death penalty for gays oh yeah that 's on the agenda ! a favorite cheap shot attributing these words to jesus but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me '' words spoken by a character in a parable jesus tells in luke 17. honestly knowing something about the subject it was hard to sit all the way through this stinker and you wo n't have to know much to smell a rat sadly the theologically and biblically illiterate crowd who thought that dogma or the da vinci code were remotely accurate will find this kind of presentation impressive it comes as no surprise at all of the way through when we learn that the director is a bitter himself in a way it 's like a certain kind of religious film in that it never even tries to rise above preaching to the choir
the best part about this dvd is the features particularly the interviews with dawkins and doherty the director otherwise comes off as a preachy smug arsehole who gets a kick out of making fun of fundamentalist christians which is like shooting dead fish in a barrel the film itself is awful mostly bad graphics worse soundtrack and awful clips from old christ dramas awful stuff the big finale occurs when the director gets into an argument with a christian school superintendent superintendent it 's a matter of faith director but where 's the evidence superintendent we 're teaching faith and love director you 're teaching lies ! ! ! the superintendent discovers that the director had misrepresented himself and the purpose of the interview and walks off in a huff apparently that proves christ is a myth obviously the director had no idea how to transfer the concept of the mythical christ to film read challenging the verdict instead
i bought this dvd thinking i could get what my pilates class gives me right at home boy was i wrong this is a horrible example of pilates the sessions just goes through the motions they do n't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level the transitions are way too fast maybe i am spoiled by having such a great pilates teacher but this dvd is a waste of money !
i bought this dvd despite the mixed reviews and have to report that i was disappointed with the purchase i have another pilates tape not dvd that was one continuous workout which i much prefer with this one there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions i also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session
i think i just do n't like pilates because i really did n't care for this workout plus you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you 'll have a round hard belly this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes so that 's the main reason i just did n't like this video
this video tape works but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each all pasted together to make a full workout i still think the moves work but i 'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me
i was treated '' to johnny depp and benecio del toro in fear and loathing in las vegas '' on dvd based on the late journalist hunter thompson 's book this one had a few very funny moments and the message that in las vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars without paying their bills of course it was a step up from bill murray in where the buffalo roam '' an earlier attempt to bring thompson 's antics to the screen but still a pretty low step
long on loathing boring i fear this trip was at somewhere i 've never been and i do n't want to go there a place beyond the event horizon who could care less about these people great title for a book or a film though for some reason i 've given it an extra star i do n't know why perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody 's collection of bizarre movies
i lasted 10 minutes at times i believe hunter thompson was able to write this was not one of those times his gonzo humor was just over the top not funny and stale to these tired eyes maybe it was groundbreaking once but i doubt it maybe you should watch it while stoned he probably wrote it that way
the story here dose n't matter the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction meth quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless roberts is so gay you want to smack his face he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius a role he plays better than anyone today in film br
i terribly disappointed by this movie it bears some resemblance to the bone collector and silence of the lamb but has none of the suspense mystery good acting and good story that these other movies have this lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end the cops were basically two idiots who could n't solve the crime on their own add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie
this movie is weak poorly written and has some stereotypical dialogue the acting is for such a wonderful cast how numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel i 'm amazed at the way people compliment this film deep symbolic c'mon ! this is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool
this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem '' be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history
a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis
to borrow from a previous reviewer a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering
i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor and fanatic as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the conflict she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary 's great desire and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just does n't cut it
i loved my life '' and was expecting something good here based on all these reviews but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these dvds were a bad omen still i hung in and hoped for the best i was sitting there watching and really wondering do people really relate to this stuff '' the characters on this show look like they 're from jc penney catalogs or ivory soap commercials white bread sanitary vapid thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him the kids on this show are cute but all kids are cute nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing i am sooooo glad that the world is nothing like how it 's portrayed on this show never again ! !
i saw this movie quite a few years ago probably about 15 or 20 years ago i must say the first time i saw it i was n't really impressed then i read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie so when it was released on dvd i went out and purchased it i remember little about it from the first time other than it had sissy spacek in it in one of her first roles if not her very first big screen role i must say that i did n't find this movie any better now than i did then i appreciate marvins career and his acting as well as gene hackman these two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good the story could have been much better and the core of it is good marvin is a respected chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by eddie egan the real popeye doyle from the french connection drug bust in new york to collect that an associate name mary ann has forgotten to pay mary ann gene hackman and do n't ask me why he is mary ann cause they never explain it is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house he has sent back several other bag men to the chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them mary ann also is now with marvins old flame clarabell jeez what is with these stupid names mary ann also deals in white slavery enter sissy spacek he sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows this is an interesting novelty kind of movie if you are a fan of marvin or hackman check it out even if you are a fan of sissy spacek but alas this movie is just not that good the old school mob vs the new middle america mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie
i often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like prime cut '' you would be hard pressed to find a dumber story plot line or set of characters this is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70 's lew wasserman '' type production deals
what rubbish ridiculous situations and poor writing doom this boring stupid film probably the worst film that starred either lee marvin or gene hackman a real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars
well i sure could have skipped this one i well remember the critics raving over this on television but why is beyond me mostly i was just plain bored there simply was no depth at all just bunches of short takes and wise cracks bush was just downright dirty making insults and slurs all over the place something i do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be president and it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that mary matalen the deputy manager of bush 's campaign and very maybe she wrote some of the slurs bush used is now the wife of james carville top strategist for clinton 's campaign and basically the star of the movie but all the scenes were focused on the funny quip the bon mot no long scenes of the work or any answers to any questions about clinton either for that matter
i found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites if a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore
way too much money was put into the movie the cast is way too old it completely lost all of the grittiness and the pain of the play it 's very unfortunate that there was an opportunity to immortalize one of the great landmarks of the contemporary musical theatre and this is all we ended up with
this movie is complete garbage i actually like robert downey jr as an actor but hated him in this movie please do yourself a favor and do n't watch this trash
the artist is a dangerously bad film there is absolutely no chemistry between robert downey and molly ringwald molly ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980 's female actresses and she certainly proves her worth here ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character was n't supposed to be that marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element the real joke in this film has to be robert downey his acting is insanely moronic i often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick i am pretty sure robert downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to from the start to the end i was annoyed i could n't see how dennis hopper and danny aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it harvey keitel gives a fair performance but i believe he is much tougher than that comparing harvey keitel 's performance in bad lieutenant reservoir dogs and mean streets to the artist it is enough to make an apparent observation that harvey keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this a smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was rising sun and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film why did they have to call it the artist could they give the movie a better title such as the player
so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing well anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing awesome good or ok has never actually seen salsa dancing ! ! i am a salsa dancer and this movie was horrible ! ! ! i have seen amazing dancing and good dancing this was terrible dancing ! and there was hardly any salsa ! it was dancing to salsa music ! that 's it the only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner other than that it was just dancing to salsa music that 's it if you want to see salsa dancing i definitely do not recommend this movie if you want to see horrible acting and old dancing then i recommend this movie there was only one thing that i liked about this movie the appearances made by tito puente and celia cruz that was great to see but not worth buying the movie for oh and the story line what was it again yeah i love movies good ones and bad ones but this one the worst movie i have seen so far to the best of my knowledge there are n't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing hopefully someday there will be
if amazon allowed zero stars this would get it absolutely awful
this movie really did n't show me anything exciting in salsa dance the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers willie colon and celia cruz
from start to finish a total waste of time i viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman we were all appalled at how desparate this pamela '' was note to the director not all women waiting on god are that desparate the so called christian principals in this movie were laughable at the end of the movie i found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time
peniston was looking good i was digging the vibe the cat she married in the film reminded me alot of ronald '' isley i was waiting for bro man to start film flip flopped between the christian vibe the sensual film was a is still crazy stuffed i likes ai n't alot of acting there but oh film was just ok with a couple of funny parts
this has got to be one of the worst most unrealistic movies to date i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks rarely are they done well this one however takes it to a whole new level what was courtney love thinking ! you 'll regret wasting your money on this i ca n't even fathom why it 's gotten decent reviews so far
this movie did n't do anything for me did n't care for the characters or the plot the ending was disapointing also
if you are in the market for a romantic lesbian love story is not the movie to look to the movie is 1 hour and 34 minutes long and i could n't wait for it to be over ! i love lilly taylor was amazing in mystic pizza who shot andy warhol dog fight and most recently made a special run during the last days of six feet under as a lilly taylor fan you will be sorely disappointed that she chose this role this story is about a woman who wants more out of life but the script is so far fetched in how this transition unfolds she goes from minimal menial high school drop out to physicist student extraordinaire in what seems like the span of a semester or two granted the time table could have been better in this film but that 's only a very small part of it every single character in this movie is obnoxious and hard to like with the exception of taylor her husband starts off a sexist chauvinist and ends the film in much the same way you would just like buy him a clue her children are bratty and always shouting they ca n't leave the room or scene quick enough her love interest is courtney love and while i love her too of late with all of her bad press she 's not likeable either courtney love is probably the worst of them all her character is afraid of change afraid of being true to herself worries too much about what other people think of her wants to be accepted at the cost of herself and as a result runs back to what is familiar to her and in the end it 's okay with her the only redeeming quality in the movie julie johnson is that julie johnson did not want to go back to the kind of woman she was before her awakening she never lost her girlish vulnerability throughout the movie and although cautiously and at times timidly eventually embraced the changes of her new life with admirable quiet strength
it starts out well but through it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis avoidable
i bought this the day it came out and watched a couple of episodes without incident and then began watching the bend in the river '' when the problems started at 1 hour 10 minutes and 43 seconds into the episode right when hannibal says sure '' the dvd just stopped and went to the main menu the rest of the episode was missing it just stopped so i tried it out on two other dvd players i have here and then figured i got a bad copy and went up to the store to exchange it well once i got it home the second one did the same exact thing so i exchanged it a third time the third copy actually plays through the episode but freezes for about 5 seconds in the exact same place that the others were messed up i have n't even gotten to the other 5 dvd 's but my assumption from reading the reviews here is that they are going to have problems too i ca n't understand how they release these seasons of the so painfully slow at universal and can let something with this many errors reach the stores in the 10 months since the release of season 2 could they not have had some type of quality control make sure that the season 3 dvd 's actually played this release has absolutely no bonus features unlike the columbia house collectors edition ones which have some outtakes and other things and i have to wonder with this release just like the other two seasons why can they not put chapters in where the commercial breaks are instead of having to fast forward to get back to the spot i left off just like season 2 these are double sided dvd 's which scratch very easily and make all kinds of noises in the dvd player i would have liked 6 single sided dvd 's much better and one last problem is that when you put the dvd you absolutely have to watch the universal studios introduction for about 10 seconds because you can not skip it and access the menu there are two good things i can say about this release the first being that it 's the which is the best television show of all time and this is probably my favorite season the second good thing is that a coupon is enclosed for 5 off of season 4 when it gets released to have released this season with this many errors and problems on the dvd 's is an insult to fans everywhere who have waited years to buy this on dvd universal needs to recall all of them and issue working copies update i have just gotten off the phone with universal and they have said that they will replace the dvd for me and others who are having problems you can call them at or email and put season 3 replacement in the subject line i have added a star to my review since they 're customer service was friendly and returned my call promptly but i have still subtracted a star for each trip i have made to the store
2.5 stars first time director steve pink has written the screenplay for two wonderful films high fidelity and grosse point blank so as a director i would imagine that he would have to read the script before deciding to make a film either he had a case of blindness the day he read the script or he did n't read it at all also he did n't take the time to research writers adam cooper and bill collage who while still relatively new to the game hav been responsible for one of the worst films of the decade 2004 's olsen disaster new york minute being said accepted is n't the worst film of the decade nor is it even remotely in the worst films of the year category rather accepted is a seriously ambitious film with a plot as thin as nicole richie on a fad diet '' to quote richard roeper that statement could n't be more on the money to retread other reviewers at the beginning of the film sherman schrader played by jonah hill whose thirty second role in the old virgin was hysterical says to main character bartleby gaines justin long of such bad films as herbie fully loaded and waiting this will never work '' and it wo n't there are holes in every part of the film 's design none of this will ever work it 's impossible so then i pose the question why make a film out of a plot that would in no way shape or form ever work and please do n't answer my question with some stock answer like well it 's escapism it does n't need to work '' which may be true in some cases if the screenplay is written properly accepted 's is not every character with one exception more on him later is a complete stock character drawn from every movie ever made bartleby is the slacker type who done right see ferris bueller can actually be funny there is schrader the fat kid that gets picked on and in this film made to dress like a sperm a hot dog and scores of other things there is the tomboy or rory in this case played by maria thayer of the wonderful strangers with candy '' who nobody seems to see as a beautiful woman and she is very beautiful but as one of the guys also enter the token black guy to use terminology from not another teen movie hands played by columbus short of course no main gang '' character list would be complete without the wierd kid that nobody understands or in accepted glen adam herschman the film is also riddled with gross out humor and to keep quoting richard roeper from his review of waiting you can do gross out stuff and still be funny but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters '' so you ask why am i generously giving this film 2.5 stars if it seems like i hate it so much well accepted does have some irresistable laughs and it sort of grew on me but only because of the things it has to say about the education system in college you are required to take high cost classes that you do n't really want to take but are forced to anyway why not let kids take a numerous amount of classes to figure out what they want to do and still have it count for their degree but the way bartleby and his gang go about it is too loose for college freshmen if freshmen had as much freedom as this college allows they would be passed out every night and never actually learn anything there are more kind of commonsensical things that the film says about our seriously damaged educational system but i 'll let you discover it on your own the only thing that kept me in the theater long enough to hear some of the insights was the what had to be improvisation of the brilliant lewis black there is absolutely no way that these screenwriters could have written such brilliant rants and raves it had to have been improvised and besides if you have listened or seen any of black 's shows his dialogue sounds much like his philosophies black plays ben lewis aptly named dean lewis schrader 's uncle who used to be a college dean and now works in a shoe store it is n't long and lewis is fired and helps in bartleby gang 's plot to start a college with all of this information i leave the decision to you weigh heavily the points i have outlined and determine if you want to spend nine or ten dollars to see this in the theater or if it might be better to wait for it to come out on dvd i ca n't really lean either way this is definitely a personal taste film
i hate lawyers what is a lawyer anyway basically it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an class womb shakespeare said it first and best first let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' former enron john wing put a little houston spin on that one get all the lawyers in a room shoot 'em ! the mouth so you miss ! '' exactly anyway the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of yappers exciting so i was probably all amped up to despise it but not really back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater i briefly considered going into law briefly for about an hour it was a desperate time and i needed money why did i consider walking hell 's highway if only for an instant because john grisham boring a kind of tom clancy for the and set made it all sound pretty damned funky and lucrative ! hey dig that bmw 7 series baby beep beep ! in his engrossing little novel the firm '' granted i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes but it held my attention i mean seriously you 're 19 and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool and strippers man plenty of strippers oh and did someone mention a bmw what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your now it 's true grisham writes like kim jong il sings but the firm '' anyway was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace from the pedestrian law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis law firm the pretty damned atrocious all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense suffocating sense of malice grisham like michael crichton is n't a prose genius he 's not even mediocre but he writes for film and the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment so it 's baffling that with all the right stuff cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere gene hackman doing his gene hackman thang as the corrupt but ultimately and pathetic senior partner and sydney pollack helming it up the treatment of the firm '' is such a yawner talk about contempt of court pollack takes all that intricately woven little and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen at its guts really the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare i 've bet the farm on this gig i 'm getting big money i 'm working like a fiend my wife is having trouble remembering my name and evidently i 'm not doing for loaded clients 'm doing money laundering for the mob pollack just mangles the whole thing convolutes the simple and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning casting is part of the problem cruise does his thing running around memphis with his briefcase hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure sleaze the firm '' is all when he 's onscreen but hey a man can only do so much jeanne tripplehorn cruise 's squeeze who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn seriously google the two of 'em astounding ! is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief too bald too cracker too rotund too silly too to do the role justice holly hunter is even worse hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy which is baffling given that she 's about and has all the sex appeal of an it does n't help that she 's a big ugly southern stereotype the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be you want her to die she does n't pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny she is n't ed harris i think is in this movie so is hal holbrook which kinda ruins everything because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks anyway the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance deus ex machina of paul sorvino don morolto kind of goombah name is dat anyway somebody call tony soprano ! who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours by all means belly up to the bar otherwise case dismissed js
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today they have such great stage charisma top notch talent and they consistently get better with age ! what other band sounds better 30 years later after my disappointment with the special one cd i was excited to hear about this dvd i heard most special one songs live and could n't understand why they translated to tape poorly having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out and the songs do sound much better now such tremendous intensity robin has live the guitars and bass sound great and there 's a great build up to the climax of each song however what 's really the downer about this dvd is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track you then get of each live song not a single song appears here in its entirety it 's like a behind the music without drama or drugs based around a new live show the banter is great but this format kills the replay value of this disc the closest comparison i can give is the version of silver how the second dvd has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs that 's exactly what this is like however you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show bonus features are fun with the band and their families visiting japan although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety perhaps someday we 'll get the budakan show on dvd or an updated every trick in the book dvd update exactly a year later i 've still yet to pop this into my dvd player for a second watch and cheap trick 's still my favorite band
i have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because i wanted my kids to see it i was very young when i first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in asia daryl hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid tom was also perfect for the role i ca n't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of tom hanks and meg ryan though but it was n't bad i ca n't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie i let my kids watch it finally together with my niece we found ourselves in the end it was just so touching we could n't help it even the theme song sang by rita coolidge was perfect for the ending for those who wan na know the title is love came for me '' i 'm glad i purchased the anniversary edition i have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what i needed it would have been better if dts was used but i 'm not complaining for those who are thinking of getting this i hope you make the decision to do so tom hanks is a certified great actor this movie will soon be in line with the classics like gone with the wind '' and breakfast at tiffany 's '' it 's already a collector 's item you wo n't regret it ! besides love stories do n't get out of style
we rec 'd the splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage all our other dvd 's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly i already threw away the container we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem this is the first time we 've bought a dvd that had a problem we 've always been very satisfied with the amazon service and products as well thanks for asking pgammon
to be honest i 've never been that impressed by the kind of programmes the history channel puts out too much emphasis on entertainment and not enpough on decent research historical accuracy etc so it was no big surprise to find this programme seriously skewed '' as a previous reviewer put it this is a thoroughly lacklustre product which suffers from the same shortcomings that i already mentioned so rather than waste my time and yours reviewing something that is n't worth watching in the first place i just want to direct your attention to the real da vinci code '' released in may this year 2006 it still is n't the definitive investigation you 'd need more than a couple of hours to cover all the relevant topics but it has this offering seriously outclassed in every even as straight forward entertainment !
this film repeats the basic premise over and over and was so bad that i really could n't believe it the narrator talks about the holy grail being not a cup but mary magdeleine being the grail that carried not the blood of jesus but the unborn child it says she went to egypt where she raised her child then is states that davinci painted clues into his 'last super ' which pints to the true relationship between mary and jesus it speaks about the 325 ad council of nicea and about the sang graal dadocument which supossedly explains the true history of the christian faith ithis poor documentary reapest the same footage almost all the way through this hear the same quotes over and over
this dvd gives documentary coverage concerning such da vinci code topics as rosslyn chapel the priory of scion the knights templar the gnostic gospels le dossier secrets da vinci paintings and opus dei this dvd beyond the da vinci code seems to bend over backwards measuring every narrated word to try to support and be sympathetic towards the dan brown allegations made in his novel despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary they still seem to be in favor of what dan brown has written in the da vinci code out of a half dozen expert interviewees the most notable are two big '' names who are major influences on the da vinci code book margaret starbird author of the woman with the alabaster jar and richard leigh one of three authors of holy blood holy grail which was a ny times bestseller in 1982 both appear throughout this program these two are probably the biggest proponents of the conspiracy today after dan brown himself so it is especially meaningful when richard leigh and margaret starbird disagree with what dan brown has written ! according to expert interviewee richard leigh though the da vinci code book says that the knights templar found documents to prove the conspiracy in reality nobody knows what if anything was found by the knights templar in solomon 's temple leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram pentacles stars as mainly representing the sacred feminine '' is nonsense that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often ! richard leigh also explains that the original priory of scion was last referenced in 1619 but the modern day priory of scion people from the last 50 years are bonkers '' trying to present a hoax of the le dossier secrets to try to gain political influence for themselves this le dossier secrets which appears on the bogus fact '' page at the beginning of the da vinci code book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of jesus but has been debunked for decades in france it does not belong on a page titled fact '' in the da vinci code book ! that is very misleading not factual brown says the le dossier secrets were discovered but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney ! margaret starbird another major influence on the dan brown novel says that even though she believes in the bloodline there is no proof of the bloodline lasting into the french merovingian line of kings circa the first millenium the documentary using other expert interviewees and location footage goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the rose line alignments being found in significant locations throughout the da vinci code novel as well as showing there is no evidence that leonardo da vinci was a member of the priory of scion let alone the grandmaster the rose is not the symbol for the priory of scion and opus dei has no interest in the secret '' bloodline of because they do n't believe it even exists sadly most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show in brief statements before quickly moving on to the next topic while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what dan brown 's da vinci code book claims about the conspiracy overall i was disappointed by this history channel dvd for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ai n't so in the da vinci code book though i am not surprised the history channel usually sides against christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows in my opinion a much better da vinci code debunking dvd is breaking the da vinci code which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel 's lies about history and jesus
i do n't care what the hollywood media machine has told the world about this annoying and worthless film every character is a cliche warren beatty and halle berry have no chemistry ! if this is what 's left of his creative soul he should just check into a home and get an alcohol addiction the are overwhelming his common sense the only redeeming quality is oliver platt 's natural comic presense but that does not make up for this film insulting every ethnicity culture community and individual in america not to mention all of our intelligences i was so disgusted and nauseated by this film 's arrogance and hypocrisy that i had to leave my grandmother 's house she still finds warren charming ! if aliens were to see this movie as a first impression of us we would all be gone in a flash of brilliant white light which anyone who likes this movie would deserve this movie makes me angry for living in hollywood by the way warren beatty raps '' throughout this film so have a trash bag and smelling salts handy zero stars
bulworth is ostensibly warren beatty 's brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say he tells a black church congregation to put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives '' if that 's what you were thinking you 'll love this movie otherwise bulworth is jaw droppingly bad to take such a hight position as to attack beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give bulworth way more credit than it deserves it 's distinguished from movies that are simply bad '' through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones not content to be racism hiding in plain site bulworth 's racism is disguised as its own solution drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise youths nina halle berry articulates an informed point and it 's a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart like versions of zip coon in so doing beatty reminds black americans that no matter what they accomplish we know who they really are however limited the potential of the opening premise bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind the film never approaches the kind of farley brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination the sincerity of the politician 's catharsis is hidden from us both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once beatty starts rapping his lines he never stops making the actor as opposed to the character look uncomfortable for the duration that this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing the film 's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of roberto benigni 's embarrassing life is beautiful '' from the year before both have to be seen to be believed
cast harold becker cast al pacino john cusack bridgett fonda danny aiello martin landau david paymer anthony franciosa richard schliff lindsay duncan running time 111 minutes rated r for language and some violence city hall '' is one of those hopeful yet ultimately frustrating films that never really delivers toward its potential it 's as if the characters the plot and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming and then only introduced in the editing room the film begins with a lackluster conflict the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the ny mob families who looks as if he came directly from central casting and acts just as stiff before we even know anything about this character he 's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop 's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved gunfire is exchanged and everyone is dead including the innocent child who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than purposes and is treated like '' shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience only to draw in the bigger fish in the water the primary characters on the heels of the shooting we are introduced to our principles al pacino as the mayor john cusack as the deputy mayor managing the entirety of new york the completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of new york being managed at least from all appearances we are given on screen by these two characters is beyond laughable but insipid the central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by city hall to this one shooting incident as the world is we suppose put on temporary pause for days afterward in new york by this event cusack abandons his supposed position with city hall and becomes a mickey spilane trodding beside bridget fonda on some investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop suspected of corruption and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place having been questionably released on parole years before everyone phones in their performances which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes then got distracted by something better to do possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming and just showed up to through with the dialogue numerous gaffs faux pauxs regarding life in new york cornball accents by cusack fonda 's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle vanilla backgrounds boring dialogue save al pacino 's impassioned yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of james bone and his personal conversations with pappas make for a really unsatisfying films city hall '' just ca n't deliver and feels like a tv movie of the week
would have given 0 '' stars on this one boring and lacks any direction
not very good selections from the series i watched as a kid thr students in my class got bored of them after a few minutes
on tuesday november 30 1982 i had just come home from a scout meeting and i turned on the television and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper and told me to turn it off and i did n't even know the name of this i looked it up in the tv guide later on and unfortunately due to the fact that i was still shaken up by the other night i did n't dare share the name due to the fact i 'd get a sermon i was at a crucial age in my life where i was 15 where i had desires for girls but emotionally i was not prepared for them i can understand the fact that it 's a morally bankrupt film and was capturing the fact of the revolution but i do n't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world 's been turning but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that i guess looking back my parents argument is there 's a time and place for everything '' but guess what that would 've been a perfect time to help me understand i know that a few months later that i brought it up to my aunt who 's a committed christian and she paled which led up to the sermon and to be honest i felt like i could n't win i feel with this movie i had to not let it go until i got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it 's entirety and i did n't get to see this until i was 20 and i brought it back up to my parents as my father 's friend had just opened a video store in cherry hill and the battle started again i have felt like a eunich i did n't get to watch this movie all this time and when i did i found it rather appealling and now wanted to add it to my collection i was getting flack as i actually bought the blank video and tried to get it copied onto the videotape looking back i would 've been better off just buying it but i know i have to wonder if i would 've come to same conclusion i got the tape finally when i was 25 years old and watched it once and since then i lost the appeal i saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from i did n't focus on the colors or the scene where ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by elaine and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that robinson took away ben 's virginity and this was when ben was trying to get together with elaine i found this to be coincidental but rather truthful when i had a woman make a phone call one night when i was working in a convience store and it was a rather seductive one and then the woman just turned it off when i finally met her kind of like robinson doing it to ben and especially when he was in too deep the fact that this happened could 've been an alternative lesson my father could 've taught me if he did n't want to talk about the sexual nature with this mindset i do n't own this anymore and have no inclination or intention of owning it again i ca n't honestly say if i bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would 've made a difference i feel that once i saw the fact that robinson made a blank promise to make ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me this is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would 've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to or it 's implied that it 's a man 's job to have an affair but that 's the world 's standard and morally it 's wrong for either side to cheat on one another it left me feeling that i was n't worth the time to talk about this movie to and about the way the relationships in the movie and made to feel dirty because i wanted to know and angry that i had to repress myself and my feelings and my character to fit this model that pleased my family i just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it and not worry about your parents helping you mind you it is a pg rating so anyone 13 and under not without a parent
i love this film it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i 'd have given 5 stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i 've ever seen
i would have given this film 0 stars if possible this film was long boring and painful to watch if you like jane austen films or other bbc period films do not be deceived by this one it is nothing like those types of films
i saw this at the library and brought it home thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the 1950 's but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran we did n't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography and for the most part it seemed like the costumes hair way of speaking etc were accurate for the time period so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when but something just was n't quite right and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children because of the nudity
these movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies from a horror movie fan 's perspective i remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original it 's alive '' the only thing about babies mutated or not that scares me is having to change their diapers it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too ! what a worthless waste
it 's alive 3 island of the alive is down right hilarious nothing is better than watching mutant babies grow up and eat people i mean seriously my personal favorite scene was the court room scene with the baby '' in the cage good laughs in this flick michael moriarity portrays a father of a mutant baby '' the government decides to put the lil ' suckers theres five or so now on an uncharted island five years later they decide they need to get fluid samples '' off the creatures for scientific research michael moriarity goes along for the ride well the babies '' have grown into five year old adults '' and one of them has had a baby of their own yes indeed moriarity is a pappy all is well until they all die except moriarity the monsters want to get back to civilization and moriarity gets stuck with the job of taking them there somewhere along the journey they chuck him out into the ocean cuba picks him up he gets back to the states bla bla bla all in all this is a funny movie that deserves a four star rating on a scale watching this movie alone is like getting beat to death by golf clubs but watching it with a bunch of lovers is a riot if you liked island of the alive '' i recomend the awesomely bad movie creature '' it 's on drugs and totally funny what i learned from island of the alive cuban officers are nice and funny
the first movie was fantastic the second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better this third movie was absolute trash and i will never buy it
this dvd is a complete rip off the performance is more focussed on bonos sunglasses with a camera in his sun glasses of all things keep it simple and exciting that means proper editing its oviuous this editor should'nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience we are not at the show so stop trying to create an atmosphere of swishing shots because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room and your job is to bring something into the room not try and pull you in with disasterous effects what a great big switch of off on the remote and a 13 dollar cash in at the second hand store thnak you very much for nothing
well my gosh what a waste of time really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes members ticket prices i wo n't go on and on about being sold out where it all went wrong all i know is that are getting by and panicked when popmart was'nt well recieved mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it so the dvd boring whats wrong with it 1. crap editing as others have mentioned 2. the band look bored 3. bono looks like fat elvis 4. bono ca n't sing anymore 5. was it really neccesary to have a camera in bonos sunglasses 6 extras two thirty second clips of zoo tv and popmart both of which they have'nt released on dvd and both of which are impossible to buy as vhs is extinct now despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums 7. the credits are listed as a extra feature 8. plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album all that you ca n't leave behind '' its moments but at the end of the day its the performance that counts not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable ! ! camera editing if you want to have a collection of live before they turned crap and commercialised add rattle and hum '' actung baby '' zoo tv live from sydney '' and popmart '' vhs 's to your collection thats if you can dig them up from anywhere have yet to release a decent dvd dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth
i 'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming but i feel ripped off just the same
i 'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie i have seen plenty of russian films and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component mikhalkov for example is a director who can do this this movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson although the acting is n't necessarily bad you do n't get attached to the characters i got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors did n't match the movie 's theme and plot at times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching even though i never do that anyway i do not recommend this movie if you want to watch some good russian movies go with brother '' burnt by the sun '' prisoner of the mountains '' war '' or unfinished piece for the mechanical piano
i received my cd tape and was very excited to watch it with my son the first time was ok however the time it skipped i can not watch the entire tape of this i had thrown out the receipt so i could not return it jennifer neuma
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and conversely what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica kim basinger who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery 1 what is it after lots of in various parts of the bad guys round up jessica 's family while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a day spa owner cop are trying to help them mystery 2 how will the cell phone save the day mystery 3. watch for the credits at the end of the film they show up on a yep you got it
having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesday '' unbiden into our aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said hey this book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor 's well they filled up the space look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial presenter will somehow make it all for one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry
love this movie but the transfer was so pathetic that i returned it to the vendor this dvd is absolutely the worst transfer i have ever seen mgm goofed on this classic
this is the worst transfer of a movie that is not a before dvd bootleg that i have ever seen many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights or so it appears and lines dance around with the sound it was so bad i thought it was in individual damaged dvd until i read other reviews here and on imdb this is far worse than most cheapie transfers that are no longer owned but are in the public domain at least in those instances they usually have the excuse that the print they are working from is old and worn i have a much better video of exodus on vhs tape in ep ! and this movie is currently being offered at amazon for 14.95 do n't bother ! tape it off tcm and you 'll have a far higher quality visual record as for the movie itself despite good actors and one of the most wonderful music scores it 's very flat kirk douglas would have been a far better choice than newman who acts like he just came off a binge after a losing pool streak nonetheless it should not be sold with in lousy visual copies
i loved what the bleep but this was very disappointing there was no new information it was basically a very boring repeat of everything that she said in what the bleep we know the vague concepts already we are looking for specific information for practical application that is what this video is advertised as providing unfortunately it offers none at all it just felt like an cheap effort to make another buck on the what the bleep hype watch what the bleep it 's amazing pass on this one it 's a waste of time and money
i loved what the bleep and i specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day ' this video teaches nothing about how to create your day nothing it 's just ramtha jz knight talking about the fact that you can create your day i heard you in the movie ! i bought this to give me some additional insights into how to create my day it does not teach any how whatsoever do not buy this video ! buy the secret '' buy the attractor factor '' by joe vitale buy wealth beyond reason '' by bob doyle do not buy this video
hmmmm infomercials now seen as documentaries if you are in need of hope then i guess you 'll believe anything harry potter was so much better than this guess jk rowling has a much better imagination than jz knight 7 review given all the hoopla over what the bleep quite frankly did the people rendered homeless by the tsunami create that did the students injured at the recent shooting at dawson college in montreal canada create that or even still did the people who were on the new zealand airplane that crashed in fall 2006 in the pacific create that as well sometimes others impose their wills on innocent bystanders through brutal force and that is not creating your day that is just plain tragic we are not victims of life but neither are we masters of the universe either
i unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same this was the best of the others were pure wastes of money while this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point if you 've seen what the bleep '' dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds
wow ! practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and sounding phrases change your voice and you too can be a channeler ! for money ! i 'm definitely in the wrong occupation has anybody ever thought to question ramtha '' on a few specifics that a year old being from atlantis '' should know did ramtha 's ancient society speak english what an amazing stroke of luck ! what did ramtha 's people do for agriculture and diet how was society structured what tools did they use and where was atlantis '' precisely located i 'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia or how many years precisely and in what reckoning could ramtha show us some writing samples in atlantean script linguists could help here or is it just possible that jz knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we want and need to believe is n't that a more realistic explanation what does that say about those who buy into this
i was so disappointed with this dvd oh my goodness it just rambled on for me and was n't to the point i loved the film what the bleep '' and was looking for more i 've just read ask and it is given '' and am in the middle of the follow up book the amazing power of deliberate intent '' both by esther jerry hicks i was abit reluctant to go down the road of channels '' have got my attention they 're written with grace i personally do n't recommend this particular ramtha dvd perhaps there are others by ramtha that are more
i purchased this dvd and it was scratched to hell it will not play without continuously skipping
i liked david cross more when he was the violinist for king crimson in the 1970 's his comedy pales in comparison to his progressive rock credentials hopefully david will call up robert fripp and get it together with crimson
i think david cross is a brilliant comic even more amazing is that each show shut up you pride is back etc is different material not the same jokes again and again i would love to see a dvd of one or more of these standup shows however this dvd is purely a documentary following cross around to clubs where people heckle him i do n't want a documentary about how crappy being on the road doing comedy is bring on the jokes give us a dvd with his full standup routines ! please
i love david cross 's comedy i love his stand up i love show but this dvd is not kinda boring it is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen there may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd there is no accounting for taste but 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released
this movie was kinda boring not enough of cross ' standup also when there was footage of his stand up it wasnt that funny
do n't get me wrong like a lot of you looking over this dvd i like david cross 's comedy a lot and i 've always enjoyed show too i think this documentary disappointed me so much because i found its overall effect neither very entertaining nor engaging things i like about some documentaries but instead rather formless and mean spirited while we do get a candid look at the exhausting realities of life on the road on a tour i admit cross does run into some impossible crowds and pain in the people so much of this dvd seems designed to make other people including of cross look stupid for a comic who routinely and hilariously criticizes religious and political thinkers for their intolerance cross himself frequently comes across as a pretty intolerant and elitist guy it 's just odd to me that cross would take his tour out of comedy clubs a neat idea and into rock clubs then get irate when crowds behave like they 're at a rock show director lance bangs had the opportunity to 1 widen our understanding of what it 's like to be on the road and 2 ask some interesting questions how do you make people laugh how do you deal with the exhaustion the disappointments of being a performer instead he just delivers a documentary full of easy cheap shots and unenlightening minutiae bangs has done some good work in the past with musicians i do n't know what happened here save your time and money
even though i would agree that erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath '' story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true '' story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich 's story in the same way that the xena '' character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess '' though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman '' prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin 's boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy mules than on the personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and george who becomes erin 's the convenience '' factor is totally and for erin 's benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus '' check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with illnesses that the plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie not even slightly
could fall asleep easily reminds me of poly sci 101 the q a session in the end is good
noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to some people have told that i dont really know what i am talking about here i can only recommend them to read what noam wrote about cuba hope to see you there noam
found this presentation very poor after reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech i was a greatly disappointed it was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like think you all know what im referring to here i suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point i give this dvd one star and read his books ! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this i ask myself how can he be an mit professor with such poor teaching skills an off ice prof
once again chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive ! it 's all america 's fault ! the evils of capitalism ! long live socialism ! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge 14.95 for it brilliant ! from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing !

maybe because i did n't like porco everything was for me animation is definitely not as good as his later movies not enough weirdness tried too much for the plot everything was just too as if he tried to carry the whole movie on porco 's shoulders but once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and porco was a pig there was n't anything else there

micheal moore made me vomit while watching this movie america would be a better place if he left here which he should because he obviously does n't appreciate everything that his country does for him his extremely one sided argument has no historical value and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much
i am not sure where to start with this movie or this persuasive visually essay after all that is what it is anyone who states this movie is entire fact despite political stripe is really not being honest with himself or herself many of michael moore 's arguments and positions on topics really follow a 1 1 3 '' formula for instance fahrenheit opens with the 2000 election how different news channels were n't displaying solidarity with the results of the election then the film states how bush stole florida from gore how did bush do this well his brother jeb was the governor at the time which is how ! now i am not saying that is n't shady and i was living in florida and voted in that election i recall how crazy that entire process was but you know how this entire situation could have been avoided if al gore won tennessee his home state and arkansas president bill clinton 's home state after all gore worked with him for eight years had gore won these states he would n't have had to worry about florida ! nevertheless jolly old michael moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film i know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it should n't have been made my response to that notion is if you are that upset gop make your own movie '' as for president george bush i have a question is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself because i find myself getting really confused i am not sure how he can be both i imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent not to be stupid consequently president bush seems to be both as ominous as hitler but as dumb as porky pig i am confused but i think that is the ruse behind moore 's mix message in this movie i want it to be understood i do n't think bush is the brightest crayon in the box but i do n't think the fault of the world is his pratfall it just is n't one person who makes decisions in government any college level course will explain that information to you there are many shadowy and dark figures in american politics that are both republican and democrat these factors fall into every element of contemporary america as for itself what a terrible thing to happen to any country the fact it happened in new york city was unspeakable i am able to say i had been to the wtc before and after the attack seeing the aftermath was quite moving to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain as for the story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping was touching however what about every soldier 's family who had to deal with a death related to the war on terror not just in this current war but in every war that was ever fought the bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time as i write this i feel conflicted but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing was that mother 's pain fake no was her son not a hero of course he was but every war has a casualty which is why it is war and for every mother who is upset her is involved with this war there is another who is pleased her is defending the united states i think michael moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe what do you think i suppose i understand moore 's plan blame people here in the united states because after all if al gore were president we would n't have terrorists right if al gore were president we would all have better public schools lower taxes and no crime right finally if al gore were president there would be no plot against the united states united kingdom and other countries in regards to blowing up public airlines right remember that the wtc was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists when bill clinton was president just some food for thought in modern times we as a country should stand together and be a democracy blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today my greatest concern is this once bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him or are we going to be moving forward there are still some hard core gop members who still hate bill clinton for things that are wrong in this country come on people in conclusion the moral of the story is do n't believe everything you see on tv this movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills the problem with this country is n't bush michael moore or the war in the middle east it is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next american idol not the next american president
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it the dvd we just purchased was horrible they chopped out so much of the movie it made it it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
i 'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about christianity by now thanks to this film and the book of the same title most individuals interested in christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus that being said i will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses as a movie the code leaves much to be desired there are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in the louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect for example langdon and detective neveu after successfully evading captain feche in the museum strike a series of clues writings bloodstains keys that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover langdon and detective neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions if might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction ian mckellen a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent lacks complete credibility in this film so what went catastrophically wrong well it was n't the book or its author dan brown who has been selling copies of the code faster then they can count them and although the performances were at best questionable by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie the most obvious answer as to why the code is so deficient is ron howard the director howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present the da vinci code in a manner believable as a film not history to the audience i think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with and had a supposition of jesus and his relationship to mary magdalene
i was very disappointed with this film i had hoped to learn about the birth of a nation '' and prenatal '' life in the region but the entire film is about postnatal fighting the film is appropriate for people who find fighting to be glorious for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game this ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric in fact it sanctified the barbarism as being something heroic surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this surely the viewers deserve more than this history channel pandering
terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid
the total absence of normative values makes for tedium and revulsion not for greatness nor even for that matter for titillation when even incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference it becomes easy to see why the french are exterminating themselves by refusing to reproduce themselves at the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family the french nation will be gone in another few generations this movie will help the viewer see why sociologically and philosphically interesting in that it epitomizes the banality of evil and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig secularism is devoid of soul and offers nothing to live for nothing to live by
this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women '' is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all 5 inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women '' is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are and fun there 's dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man 's vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife catherine deneuve and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the mark i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience
i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police '' aspect and less on the science which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle
who in the world decided david caruso was a good actor i 've never before watched such a cardboard two dimentional boring portrayal of a charactor in my life
i continue to be astounded at how carelessly amazon reviewers throw around their 5 star ratings this movie is overlong and not especially comedic or romantic the main character or the actress who plays her anyway is appealing but her motivations to start a new life are n't convincing or justified her romance '' with the waiter is ludicrous and the ending is contrived and predictable it actually took me 3 days to see the ending because i just did n't have the patience to view this from beginning to end in one sitting if you are a patient romantic with 2 hours to kill i guess you might enjoy it i am not and i did not
this was not very good in my opinion the ring scared the bejeezus outta me this was not scary two weeks afterwards i still find my mind wandering about one thing why the heck did n't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room if i walk into my house and see a boy meowing and hissing at me i 'm gon na flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
do n't believe the hype this movie sucks nothing happened the ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then then the movie ended i 'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects i actually think that the so called low buget movies look a lot more realistic than todays cgi but i just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made i imediately reconized it as a sound i used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad
while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief i had a very hard time doing so with this movie this movie was just plain stupid they should have kept this film story in the states once everything moves over to tokyo the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i have n't seen in a long time i would have respected the film times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan so let 's get this straight japanese high school students act like american high school students lucas black 's character is simply told to go to a japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do everybody speaks english his father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that 's about double the size of his apartment i would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt looked and sounded more japanese japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet the japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful polite and dutiful real japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here actually they probably would n't be embarassed they would laugh at the film 's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true japanese culture japanese culture is not steeped in american hiphop and egocentric behavior and it 's a pity so many americans will see this film and actually think that japanese students are just like american students there would be nothing further from the truth japanese students do not act look or sound like what was filmed here not by a long shot given my dislike of how the japanese culture was handled in this film it left me finding the plot irrelevant the plot was ok but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of japanese culture or kept the story in the states
i mean nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin nothing but fast cars severly underweight and plenty of hop music it was like watching an extremely long music video sean is supposed to be in high school but as old as he looked i guess he was on the 10 year plan on top of that he talked like forrest gump in order not to go to jail sean moves to japan to live with his dad sean was able to find himself a crew real quick and if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school how come they had so much time to race fix cars and go to parties should n't they have been studying for entrance crams if it was n't for bow wow and vin diesel small part at the end i never would 've watched this waste of a film
in previous reviews the aspect ratio of this dvd set is often mentioned i have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong it may be true that the series was shot in and i remember seeing it that way on belgium tv but this is not that version ! when watching these dvds it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong the top of people 's heads are frequently cut off sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible i also own the dutch of this great series which has aspect ratio no extras but very cheap less than comparison showed that the signature editon used the version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a version again if the series was originally shot in than this is not that version ! shame on you hbo for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called special edition
according to the internet movie database this miniseries was originally filmed in so that means that the signature edition is reduced from fullscreen to widescreen for modern tvs that means a lot of the picture has been removed in my view this is a fatal flaw if you want the real version get the older dvd set as in my opinion this one does n't have enough extras to recommend it even for people who own widescreen tvs update recently i purchased the signature edition of this miniseries as my old one was badly damaged so i had the opportunity to compare the two i immediately put a sample of both the old and new dvd episodes contrary to a later reviewer 's assurances that this dvd set was filmed in ratio and that it was cropped for the original tv airing i can now state with absolute certainty that that is not the case or if it was this edition has suffered a further cut giving the viewer even less image at least vertically to watch the signature edition is definitely a cropped version as it showed a distinct loss of image at the bottom of the screen in the clips that i chose to compare this does not apply to the titles which have been for this edition and are an improvement for those of us with big screen tvs it may be that the miniseries was filmed in something like as it may be the case that in the horizontal plane some image has been recovered but if it was filmed in the signature edition does not reflect that also this dvd set has some very apparent visual flaws that are not evident in the original dvd release during the special effects sequences during spaceflight etc there are often visible horizontal mismatches on the film these happen with almost every space sequence and are very distracting indeed because the eye is naturally drawn to the flaw to be completely fair there 's no way i can tell whether this is a dvd flaw or if it 's due to the transfer from my dvd player to the tv but it should n't be there and i do n't experience this flaw with any of my other dvds so my warning still stands this is not the definitive edition of this miniseries the original dvd release is the series as it was meant to be seen uncropped vertically the signature edition shows less image and a poor quality image and the visual artifacts make the spaceflight sequences virtually unwatchable especially on a larger screen needless to say i returned this dvd set for a refund in my opinion it is if this series was indeed filmed in the definitive edition has yet to be seen on dvd i would like to see such an edition in the future perhaps remastered and enhanced for viewing and perhaps in a hdtv format so that it can really be appreciated on big screen tvs
movie dvd quality dvd extras do n't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members in dreams '' is without doubt the career low for neil jordan as well as actors annette bening aidan quinn stephen rea and even robert downey who 's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career the film aspires to be a psychological in the vein of psycho '' and the silence of the lambs '' but is completely undone by a script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters uninspired direction shallow performances choppy editing and a grossly ineffective musical score only one scene in the movie is played convincingly and that 's the one in which annette bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie unfortunately that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile in terms of technical quality the dvd presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable picture quality is clear and sharp the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers i was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that i did n't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question the dvd extras are thumbnail cast and crew biographies that mention much better movies several lackluster screens filled with production notes '' and finally the theatrical trailer which is probably the best thing on the disc because it 's short and features quick flashes of the film 's visual highlights in dreams '' is not recommended viewing even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value
i love aitf always have and was very excited about the fact that 'it ' was going to be available on dvd it was as most of us know a 'landmark ' tv show it changed tv but what a shame the picture quality of the dvd is absolutely horrible no better in fact than the vhs tapes i have of the show that i taped myself and what excuse is there for no 'extras ' compared to other 'complete seasons ' like the 'mary tyler moore show ' or 'here 's lucy ' among others the aitf is a disgrace even the box it comes in is done on the cheap without question aitf should have been at least digitally remastered 'all in the family ' is a show 'the complete third season ' is a effort at best i have no idea what the first and second season are like but i already feel as though i 've been robbed and am not about to make that mistake again
i work as an editor on projects mostly commercials and music video 's with a couple of well regarded concert dvd 's and award winning short film work to my credit and i have to say that the editing on this disc and the previous 2 to a lesser extent demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material there is an epic quality to in concert each song is its own experience its own mini event and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically letting the tell its own story and what a story it is ! the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance s and the effect is that you are taken out of or at least not fully drawn into the marvelous natural flow of power that is live all 3 of these dvd 's are worth having simply because the band 's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs could have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event s what a shame
with so many good acters in this film you would think this would be a good a rubbish love had a few good songs and thats why i havwe giving this film 2 movie is not worth watching
if you must watch this film watch it for winkler who gives an interesting preview of his future role in arrested development '' watching this movie for prinz '' and stiles '' is counterproductive not only have the actors failed to make the best '' of the script the script was written from the viewpoint of the hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences thus we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school muse about becoming '' and stop paying attention '' to their college plans much like the friends '' genre that this movie shamelessly imitates this is a time porn '' piece where the characters have little else to do besides mature romantically '' and find themselves '' a movie for history 's circular file
i 'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back the performances are thin and uneven the plot is inconsistent and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of friends to be fair this movie does face several major obstacles it has the misfortune to depend on the acting '' of glorified ken doll freddie prinze and the vastly overrated julia stiles and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges it also attempts to survive the intrusion of ashton kutcher it fails on all counts i do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre nor do i hate the teen '' movie under which some would place down to you '' in fact ca n't hardly wait '' is one of my favorite movies i simply hate bad movies and this movie is a true abomination if you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull then by all means buy this dvd if however you value your sanity then please do not make the same mistake i did stay far far away from this movie
many of these shorts on this dvd as well as the other dvd 's in this series have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these dvd 's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you 'll see on the cartoons
this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25 postitive and 75 negative i do believe that jim hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis just another case of a wreslter who could n't seperate himself from the character and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges the only thing that bothers me is that jim hellwig was n't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions he was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact jim hellwig declined used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit this guy did make an impact in the wrestling world but it was too shortlived fans can chalk it up as a cool memory but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with flair piper hogan and the most respected of all the undertaker
this film is based on a concept that has potential a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things but it does n't deliver clearly the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us but he pretty much drops the ball right there usually with this sort of plot you are at least given the illusion that knows the answer and what 's more has some clue about what to do with it as well there 's no such suspension of disbelief in this one nor even an attempt at such adding injury if you count eye strain to insult the whole thing is shot in grainy b w with annoying jump cuts in the awards for obnoxious splash films of the year this one takes the cake but not the pi
when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience white and jittery gray the result had better be good that fraction of members of the general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money push play alongside and strain to see if it works thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically that of color the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that despite some grand intention do not work or in the alternative do not work as well citing two examples sin city which is acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white tantamount to robbery and good night america which is all and about the same the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point one might be better served as a charcoal artist color is the medium of life from a budgetary perspective black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color which in a good feature can be excessive are thus eliminated yet complications arise for instance i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand similarly the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink in shades of course and we would never know yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie or is it one wonders however that if pi production would have had more money would they have opted for color moot point it 's done notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do pi although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work clever symbolism and guts seems to lanquish for other reasons despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely throughout spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost as as result the movie stays earthbound weighted down by a mediocre plotline obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there failing repetitive effect and thin uninspiring support cast leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine airborne one second belly down the next as a fine creative exercise the creators are praised for their effort and bravery pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced a beautiful mind ''
i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5. in my mind this is a whole new venture one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley 's a great hero this movie was pretty bad the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the special effects i felt like i was watching a scooby doo version of alien whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money the plot and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much each of the first four alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of sigourney 's involvement this one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair
in good company '' goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it did n't make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it is n't an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace
these are not the original theatrical realeases in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels though they are an impressive technical achievement i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger
note this review is not about the trilogy which is great this review is about the many dvd releases the worst thing that ever happened to george lucas is when peter jackson released the extended version of lotr jackson showed fans we could demand expect and receive more from hollywood the impact of peter jackson sent shock waves among fans who released a edition of one of the greatest movies of all time even old hollywood guards like ridley scott and james cameron no surprise they are not americans took notice and improved their dvd releases this change has been powerful except in the case of lucas and to some degree his pal steven spielberg who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers the many shows greediness stubbornness and lack of respect for fans no one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality in addition please stop using the limited edition '' you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of star wars it is both false and tiring release these films in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release lucas 's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his star war movies unfortunately his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar his shady practice of releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him one must wonder what went through lucas mind when peter jackson won an academy award for best director and not him maybe if he focus on making quality films like he once did and not playing the dvd game then he could win one
this movie is silly at best racist at worse i ca n't believe ice cube actually wrote the script for this mess my opinion of ice cube has been drastically lowered it 's the old black jiving and shucking all over again this movie has all the classic black stereotypes it even has a scene where smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he 's a chicken remember the old minstrel shows nobody in here but us chickens '' there 's no plot to speak of just a bunch of insults getting high stealing money potty jokes black people knocking each other upside the head some character get punched out and smokey chris tucker goes over and yells in his face dude you been knocked out ! '' that 's a typical joke '' from this movie how about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog hilarious after watching this dvd with my family we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene and we could n't think of a single one
dated derivative unintelligent this is truly bottom of the range stuff the acting directing soundtrack and script are all dire none of the characters are even remotely sympathetic in fact i was hoping they 'd die slowly and painfully i note that billy bob thornton was both star and a scriptwriter methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose an arrogant amoral misogynistic coward with zero sense of humour do n't waste your time watching this drivel it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase
i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run '' movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i wouldn't
considering the sensational cast eli wallach terrence hill bud spencer kevin mccarthy and brock peters the era it was made in and the locations where it was shot ace high is a major disappointment the plot is uninvolving and incoherent the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife after the first ten minutes i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it a boring 120 minute piece of junk ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series save your fistful of dollars for a better film
sorry but i have to give this dvd a negative review first of all what age is it really for there are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition do n't you think it 's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old and probably even 3 the dvd needs much more real life objects it sounds and looks very dull and boring i always thought that children learn through play songs rhymes and etc but not through dull repetition even alphabet is introduced without well known abc song '' i am giving this dvd two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son so far we saw it ones as much more age appropriate material i would recommend hap palmer baby songs colors shapes '' bee smart vocabulary builder baby babble speech enhancing video baby van gogh world of colors the '' ''
i loved the first movie and i 'm sad i ca n't say the same here as rene rodriguez of the miami herald put it the worst kind of sequel the kind that exists only to give you more more more of what you particularly liked about the first film without ever justifying its own existence indeed in my view dead man 's chest was just that and it did n't please me nearly as much as the first what the filmmakers did was listen closely to what audiences said about curse of the black pearl the audience liked the swashbuckling action the audience like the humor and of course the audience capt jack sparrow the filmmakers took this feedback and tried to incorporate these things into dead man 's chest oh boy did they try way too hard it shows swashbuckling action let 's give them a sword fight between the three main characters that lasts twice as long as it should swashbuckling action check humor let 's bring back pintel and regetti the comic relief of the first movie and make them a bigger part we do n't have to explain how they got out of jail and why others of barbossa 's crew did n't we do n't have to explain why they both vow to help bring jack sparrow back when in the first movie they helped maroon him and almost shot him they 're funny that 's what the audience wants and hey lets have most of the cast on an island inhabited by cannibals we can have jack roasting on a spit then have it become a shishkabob later we can have the crew in hanging cages swinging back and forth and rolling downhill in them this whole scene of the movie will be utterly pointless but it give them the laughs they want humor check jack sparrow we 'll have plenty of him but just doing these silly loony stunts not putting him in different critical situations that display his cunning and convincing negotiation skills and his and what of the central threatening situation whether it was escaping from a sinking dory or fighting a ferocious battle with his former first mate or facing death by hanging jack was always calm cool and collected not this time so what if it goes against him as one filmmaker said himself always believing that if he can just hang on long enough that everything will eventually turn in his favor make him visibly afraid make him panic at the sight of a black spot on his hand make him cringe at the first sight of davy jones yes jack sparrow 's mannerism will be a bit different this time but its johnny depp in the same pirate costume it should satisfy the audience jack sparrow check but what of the other things that make a film good things like say a story aware that the film did need a tale to tell the filmmakers decided the plot '' of dead man 's chest would be four individual dilemmas thrown clumsily together cutler beckett wants jack sparrow 's compass why we 'll have to wait for the movie to find out norrington seeks to restore his career to it 's previous glory will and elizabeth must get beckett what he wants in order to escape the hangman 's noose and jack sparrow attempts to weasel out of a bargain made with davy jones what does this all come down to only one character accomplishes what set out to do in the whole 2.5 hours norrington brought davy jones ' heart to beckett but will had to steal the key from jones first that 's the only thing that actually gets done in the movie how could that have taken 2.5 hours to do it did n't then what filled up the extra time the pointless stuff i mentioned above as ty burr of the boston globe put it it goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2.5 hours to get there i 'm not someone whom filmmakers can show three men and a group of savage cannibals chasing someone down a beach and expect me to be impressed there needs to be a point something to it all as dana steven of slate put it without a beating heart at its center this chest feels empty indeed one star for effort and for davy jones ' creative design tentacles for a beard nice
what a disappointment ! i absolutely loved the black pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel as it turned out i had every reason to be it whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original major or minor who seemed interesting that they did but unfortunately the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while keira must have somehow pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie legolas i mean orlando bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along sometimes good but more often haphazardly to my mind the only real interesting addition was that of davey jones except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying due to the tentacles 'n all at least his was a unique addition to the movie i do sort of object however to associating him with the flying dutchman legend the two have nothing to do with each other fantasy or not and do n't get me started on the cannibals ! any way i think this movie merits the two y'ars i gave it while considerably beneath that first movie it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times but it is most definitely not as good and as a final thought the very last scene of the movie lose it entirely it simply was unnecessary
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done my review focuses on one aspect of the film indeed one character that of martha martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck even the film credits include the nickname ' besides the character 's surname evidently feeling the need to labour the point portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student later when the cult status of the ' that is murdered students becomes apparent martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic but her attempt is shown as a failure at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled in an electric wheelchair ryder 's character having finished her voyage of rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun the image of martha in her wheelchair an object of pity for ryder and for the audience signifies to us fears of being different of not being beautiful of not being loved and respected martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker and though some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both we may yet still fear martha and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own even is in physical and social reality we are more like martha for this reason ' fails as an exploration of the ' of high school a description often used by firefly 's joss whedon those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ' as the protagonists probably the majority of us ultimately may find the subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow leaving a bitter the way ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers sadly this is happening even today in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' to quote paul campos and even at best it is lazy
a real time waster not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that
dont watch this movie the only reason you should watch this movie is to see how bad it is they shoulda called it backstreet boys from hell even the cheesiest horror movies seem amazing compared to this its a true waste of time
ring of darkness david decoteau 2004 former porn director david decoteau whose most notable mainstream flicks have been the puppet master franchise he directed 3 4 and 5 the last two under assumed names takes an absolutely brilliant idea and makes an incredibly stupid movie out of it now to be somewhat fair not only is it a shlockfest but one that certainly did n't have the budget of a danielle steel miniseries imdb estimates the film 's budget at of a million dollars still it would be hard for this movie to be worse than it actually turned out about the only thing that saves it is its premise and the fact that decoteau took nothing seriously we open with gordo club dread 's greg cipes fleeing from a mansion just as he gets to the beach and seems as if he 's going to get away he 's cornered by four dark shapes cut to an announcement that boy band take ten are auditioning for a new lead singer i 'm sure you can draw the proper conclusion after a round of auditions during which you 're liable to get as sick of the catchy little tune they play just as much as you did any nineties boy band hit the four remaining members of the band choose three possible replacements for gordo shawn guiding light actor coltin scott jonah decoteau staple jeff peterson and xavier baywatch 's jeremy jackson who are all flown with xavier 's girlfriend stacy american idol finalist ryan starr whom you will be pleased to know does not sing at any point in the film to the band 's island mansion which of course looks very familiar as the three continue the auditions in a slightly more stressful situation weird things start happening with all the male skin on display you 're likely to think you 're watching a victor salva flick however comparisons with the superior salva end there decoteau directs as if ring of darkness the title by the way has absolutely nothing to do with the movie itself were his first film not his i have n't seen this much obvious shot repetition in a movie since night of the lepus the acting is atrocious as one would expect from folks who cut their teeth in t the two notable exceptions to this are adrienne barbeau who plays the band 's manager and coltin scott the script is bad even for a parody and the whole thing is just on the right side of unwatchable to keep you glued to the screen or maybe you just want to watch a boy band get theirs i know that was my motivation
if you 've ever seen a david decouteau movie brotherood leeches werewolves of new york you know what to expect a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting hunky boys in skimpy underwear and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs in ring of darkness adrienne barbeau swamp thing fog creepshow maude plays the boy band 's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band 's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality barbeau does well as always but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly by the time you 've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks you 've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending decouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been '' material for 's the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple and when she does have more than 3 lines at once the complete lack of feeling expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your that is all i can say i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again
this is one of the stupidest silly totally misdirected movies i have ever seen i have always loved disasters in nature movies '' i was not disapointed this was truly a horrific catastrophe the best part of the movie was was am getting there the story had no meaning adrienne barbeau should sell raffle tickets the next time she needs money her talents were totally wasted hers was the only talents being wasted no one else in the movie had any this dvd also will do nothing for the environment as it is going straight into the garbage if ryan starr wants an oscar she 'd better start by asking him out on a date because julia roberts and halle berry have nothing to worry about anytime soon she does have potential though there was nothing unique about the band members there was no reason for their actions i can honestly say the same thing about the producer and director of this sewage on screen
i think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies it is right up there with movies like '' this just redefined the word bad it is defecation the best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an mtv boy band video it has very bad acting slow generic killing scenes each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you can not see what they do to the victim at least half of the movie is a generic music video singing throughout the movie you almost have to see it to believe it and i definitely would n't recommend seeing it this movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist this movie will make you want to hurt someone or vomit uncontrollably it will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork oh and did i mention it was bad
i 've been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i 'm just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i wo n't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love
bland bland and more bland it seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance and fell far short of the mark with the except on the main character 's mother nearly every single character was completely unlikeable and a little lea delaria goes a long long way it does replicate the very well but it just feels so devoid of humanity
my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles i moved to echo park in late 2004. it 's depressing the vicious cycle of drugs and domestic violence and it 's all here told through the eyes of latina teenagers it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven i also found myself not caring about any of the characters gets shot la la loo goes to jail whatever ! as an aside though the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto it turns out my neighbor in is also called ernesto luckily it 's just a coincidence
this is a bad movie plain and simple there are few films more boring and badly acted than this one rent it or borrow it if you must but save yourself the money you 'll regret purchasing this film this is just a vehicle gone bad
what were those people who gave this 5 stars watching if you want to see two people jabbering for 80 minutes this is it this was adapted from a play but still this would be an f '' in any high school play i want my 80 minutes and 20 back
whatever else the gltb community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy and that is a boldfaced lie featuring world famous funny man dom deluise the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two lesbians and sparks fly '' as it is the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe from the movie 's description and with deluise in a major role the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless does deluise know that the actresses are lesbians do the production 's other members does that derail the production what mayhem ensues in point of fact however the single attempt at comedy '' comes from deluise 's portrayal of the director as a prissy fastidious old queen pampered and catered to by his assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats the bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue as the actresses '' explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of lovers unfortunately there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore the few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their roles under deluise 's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic there is an inescapable feeling that the camera the viewer and deluise are intruders about the only thing that can be said about this film is that director lee friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street other reviewers have commented on the bad infomercial level acting of the two lead characters whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads robin greenspan and lacie harmon are actually lesbians simply playing themselves if so then this is bad acting if the women are straight however one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances sadly there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film
i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money i thought this movie was incredibly over acted boring and hard on the eyes the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial for the superficial people out there i would n't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you wo n't get it when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment
this is the worst lesbian movie i have ever seen way worse than claire of the moon which was pretty bad i read the reviews so i bought it but i wo n't do that to some other sucker bad acting bad story line unattractive women no hot scenes whatsoever do n't waste one red cent on this one
first off special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality but at least this is better than the abomination that was jaws the only dinosaur movie i can think of that 's worse than this is raptor which consists of parts of the three carnosaur movies cut pasted together it has some redeeming feature in that ian malcom and john somedoy i forget his last name the guy who owns the park were actually interesting characters i guess steve speilberg finally realised that attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey 's rear end about unfortunately the boring stereotypical alan grant was the central character in this if you want to watch a steven spielburg movie that 's actually good watch or something or the lost world jurassic park '' even though recommending a sequel may seem lame the sequel is a million times better than this if you want to see a dinosaur movie then watch either the sequel to this movie or arthur conan doyle 's the lost world '' i would also recomend the 'carnosaur ' movies but i think they 're out of print if you want to see a movie where sam neill plays an interesting chracter watch 'in the mouth of madness ' or 'triangle' but definitely avoid this movie the only reason i even own it is because it was sold in a box set with the lost world jurassic park
normally i love documentaries i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all however outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen a relentless rant against rupert murdoch 's cable news station this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with fox news but i can not imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in fox news to remain awake while watching this movie watching outfoxed makes me realize what a genius michael moore is whether you love him or hate him whether you agree with him or not you have to admit his films are entertaining this film however is a major bore regina mcmenami
outfoxed is a propaganda pure and simple it is made by and is prejudicial if not more so than the fox news it is made by people who see some kind of great right wing conspiracy in the media it is made by people who like to silence any fair exchange of ideas and who want to dominate the news cycle with their contrived and simplistic stories that democrats are the good guys and republicans are monsters who want to molest children take away lunch programs and discriminate against women and minorities people who praise this film think it meets some kind of standard of real journalism but it does n't it is not necessary to pretend that it is anything other than what it is it is a propaganda film as was triumph of the will the ersatz journalists '' behind this diatribe are objecting to the fact that there are conservative opinion shows on fox news channel they do n't like that some news channel would give a voice to conservative opinions because that makes it more difficult for them to achieve their own hidden agendas the would prefer that if you have to put conservative voices on the airways you surround that one voice with five or six liberal voices to keep it in check and to make it appear that the conservative voice is an out of the mainstream of american political life point of view the propagandists behind this film deliberately confuse that fact with the fact that there are also news programs on fox it is the necessary plot of their lame story line people who praise this film as some kind of real journalism either do n't understand the difference or are themselves political hacks the bottom line is that they are jealous that fox has been successful at what it does and that they are nothing but failures at what they do
pundits would have you believe that fox news and rupert murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism they even based a bond villian on murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies nothing gets a liberal 's eyes rolling than when you say you watch fox news this attackumentary wants you to believe that fox is biased and not credible watch this attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions the former reporters gripe throughout this piece '' that rupert murdoch changed how reporters operate for the worse in their opinion what actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change they had to work hard something they probably never did before murdoch like any driven person demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees those that could hang rose with fox news those that could not keep up appear in outfoxed '' fox does have a bias on its commentary section this draws ratings the thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the journalism from the commentary sections even with fox putting a big sign up saying commentary '' they are so used to their mainstream '' liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they can not tell the difference anymore here is my latest scorecard mainstream media latest and greatest from reuters a major supplier of news to the always objective mainstream media '' fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened this photographer decided that his photos or the war was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image how many other war photos have been doctored this way on the reuters ' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage you had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story i guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident the bastion of liberal '' new york times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on in other words they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events they also revealed secrets that hurt the world 's efforts on fighting terrorists cnn nicknamed the clinton news network during the 90 's for swallowing anything the clintons had to give and asking for seconds the only thing they were upset about during the whole lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk on their online news headlines '' section they repeatedly have lou dobb 's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news lou dobb 's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for cnn and everything he states is opinion not news you would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike fox they do n't have one they think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news usa today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal oops turns out it was n't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily over 70 of the american population agreed with the bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating cbs 's dan rather this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the republican revolution swept through congress in 1994. all his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away he launched a smear campaign against president bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable his background investigation was nil people discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it after everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant the editor for the los angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election finally there is newsweek whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries they were so eager to report the desecration of islam 's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened they ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves the blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain that is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer if so that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the world perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues these are just minor examples of how the mainstream '' media operates these are real stories and influence real events in the world sometimes with serious consequences this is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day if you want more then read the book bias by bernard goldberg to get a real understanding i will stick to fox news as i have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news like any prudent person i take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means i do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct cnn reuters cbs newsweek ny times all fall squarely into the dubious at best '' category all i have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because fox separates the opinions from the facts allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and america loves them for it the liberals hate fox news fox actually investigates and reports on what happened not what the liberals wished would have happened they show the liberals for what they are full of they hated it when fox repeatedly showed then president clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up that is until he saw a tv camera and started shedding crocodile tears fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90 's was due mostly to newt gingrich clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency gingrich 's congress would not send clinton the pork barrel projects so he could n't spend to excess i wish we had gingrich leading the congress doing the same to president bush i am sure rupert murdoch is feeling outfoxed '' right now his network is ranked numero uno as it has been for some time this dvd is hovering between 2000 and 3000. i am ranked higher than it is
as mentioned in another review stolen scenes from runaway train not just clips but entire scenes also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger still worth 3 4 for a dvd just for the other action
i have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst i could n't believe i wasted 2 hours of my life on it they literally stole scenes from runaway train in this not the ideas they stole the filmed scenes the train kept going from one engine to the four in rt the continuity was a joke had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up
i bought this dvd because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen we 're still friends but i 'll never listen to one of his reviews again our taste must not be compatible my wife daughter and i seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we 've ever seen it 's the only movie i 've ever turned off before the end on the plus side watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema i used to think i knew bad movies now i know that most movies are at least pretty good and it 's only a very few that are truly bad this is one of those very few bad films best in show belongs to a genre of comedies '' that i find boring at best but often cruel and mean other films of this type are waiting for guffman '' bottle rocket '' etc if you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you 'll appreciate this movie
i imagine this movie might be funny if you 're really into dog shows i 'm not so i could n't tell you mediocre at best this is spinal tap '' was better
for such a great actor i expected to see his best a collection of his films the movies are good but it 's a huge diappointment to true de niro fans
what about once upon a time in america the untouchables cape fear men of honor the godfather taxi driver and 15 minutes i would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work the films in this collection are good but does not reflect his all of deniro 's most popular performances with the exception of goodfellas this collection is like qualifying for the olympics a little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal analyze this should have been in a comedy pack along with meet the parents and raging bull wag the dog although ok should have been left out
all of these discs are such poor quality that they continually freeze in any dvd player no wonder they 're so cheap you get what you pay for
ninety percent opinion ten percent fact for more analysis and much harder hitting investigation based on mainstream media reporting view any of alex jones ' later films the road to tyranny martial law rise of the police state and terrorstorm are far better heck you can view them all for free on google and youtube alex is a man so concerned with getting the word out that he releases all his works for free himself
i counted factual errors aka lies during michael moore 's opening speech i stopped shortly after i 'm not going to waste my time on such obviously fiction how stupid does moore think we are i was watching the election unfold and what he reported is not what happened example he said fox news pressured nbc cbs abc and cnn to change their minds and give florida to gore and then bush what a load of lies fox news has no power over the other nets nbc cbs abc cnn operate independently and reached their decisions independently without influence from fox and furthermore the other nets did not call for bush as moore falsely claimed they labeled florida undecided '' and left it that way for several days also moore claimed that a recount showed gore won florida false a bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later and not only did bush win but the recount his lead from a few hundred to several thousand because of conservative communities in western florida many other groups found the same result this video reminds me of his columbine documentary where men 's ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches it 's called creative editing moore has no ethics propagandist as far as i 'm concerned he 's no better than a kkk member same mental disorder illogic
the bedlams that greet the current republican administration each morning for usa in iraq ' have actually relegated this dvd to it is obvious that the producers of this so called ' are more likely to be fractious to bush in particular than accommodating to the american public at large it is also obvious that mr bush is not the type of person to succumb to mr moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though in the meantime i can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind to unfold
i was trying to think of the best short description of what this is sure it 's a propaganda film but that does n't mean much to most people however most people have seen attack ads around election time that 's what this is a very long political attack ad full of all the things we commonly see in such ads distortions sarcasm scary close ups mood music mocking tone glaring omissions out of context quotes etc that said the most rewarding review so far must be the one by at dl '' new york who basically condemns michael moore as because fahrenheit does n't say bush engineered himself what 's next a review that condemns at dl '' new york as because his review did n't say that bush flew the planes himself or that bush is an alien who gave birth to saddam and osama on a ufo just when you think you 've seen the craziest conspiracy theory
boring ! all this time is spent during the dvd talking about the john fisher technique but not really showing you anything specific lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique ' who cares ! i did n't order the video so that i could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique i ordered it so that i could train my own dog so little instructional information was given and the video was so boring me and my dogs fell asleep watching it what a waste
like most people i loved the original friday a true classic i had heard that this one was n't as good so i rented a copy just to check it out for myself this movie is garbage mike epps ca n't carry chris tucker 's jock what a waste of what could have been a very good movie series stick with the original do n't waste your time or money on this one
i 've always loved kay thompson 's brilliant eloise '' books eloise was born 3 years before me although she benefits from a case of arrested development not unlike dennis the menace having reached the age of 6 in 1955 and never aging since i 've been to the plaza hotel as a child in the late and early and my mother spent many happy years in the big apple some as a barbizon resident my grandmother once remarked to my mother that the oil portrait of eloise in the plaza lobby made her think she must be the manager 's daughter '' since no other explanation could account for such an ugly child '' being so prominently displayed ! kay thompson was a graduate of the same high school in louis as my mother and went on to achieve many wonderful gutsy triumphs in hollywood as a dancer choreographer designer and actress including her role in funny face '' with fred astaire and audrey hebburn as the magazine editor who advocated think pink ! '' i greatly admire the and mercurial thompson and her inspired illustrator hilary knight who did as much as thompson to bring eloise to life for that matter i very much like eloise herself who was by all accounts kay thompson 's the first eloise book was subtitled a book for precocious grownups about a little girl who lives at the plaza hotel '' eloise was a child but the books were not meant for children adults especially those who 've raised children of their own understand that children are not better wiser smarter and kinder than adults but since at least pollyanna '' if not before disney studios has been churning out a constant stream of propaganda films asserting just the opoosite and now kay thompson 's wonderful playful innocent bratty obnoxious sweet eloise has been beatified by disney as their latest child sage the problem with these lies and all others is that they blind people of all ages to their own shortcomings while unfairly blaming them on others children are not wiser and better than adults and they never have been and they never will be even if jimmy carter did think his daughter amy had the last word to say about nuclear weapons he was mistaken of course children are typically much more cruel than adults and if they say sweet innocent things from time to time which is rare it is only because they have n't lived long enough to learn better but they will learn better eventually although some of them will suppress or deny their to become seriously committed adult hypocrites adults who do n't get this either do n't have children or do n't pay attention to them as they really are disney studios ' party line notwithstanding in the books eloise 's charm lay in her vulnerabiltity her precociousness her attitude and her essential warmth which asked no quarter and took no prisoners delightful as childish qualities but lacking in shall we say nuance disney tries to make her into an marriage counselor and social activist as such eloise is transformed from a delightful child into a sociopathically manipulative prig which quite ruins the film as it also ruins real life when people go wrong like that this was never the character thompson and knight developed who was simply a charming brat and by the way a lot more credible as an actual child eloise 's future as an adult has been speculated upon some think her a likely candidate for alcholism drug addiction and perhaps certain dysfunctional sexual disorders as an adult child of an absentee mother and no father at all raised in circumstances of artificial material luxury and moral decadence such concerns are not unfocused but since we all know that eloise will never and can never get any older than 6 years of age they are i would suggest unwarranted meanwhile i wish disney studios would either go away or do something else of course children of all ages '' sanctimonious children and smug narcissistic adults who ca n't or wo n't grow up will eat this junk up as disney knows very well but i think kay thompson would spin in her grave at this pc propagandistic of her own special inner child '' who was so much more real than this disney caricacture not despite but because of her obvious childish failings on the plus side the film 's production values could not be better and the little girl who plays eloise is perfect julie andrews is absolutely wonderful as nanny the sets are great i loved the first half hour of this film before the disney message children especially little girls are the master race became apparent it 's certainly well done ! i did wonder since there seemed to be an emphasis on making the time frame seem why the featured toy store was toys r us instead of new york 's flagship toy store schwartz
when i saw that the movie was from the creators of legally blonde i figured it would be original and hilarious boy was i wrong it is so ridiculously predictable i mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot the plot wasnt even that great when topher grace was trying to show is affection for kate bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious i mean kate bosworth 's character had to be stupid not to see that topher was in love with her plus bosworth 's character was quiet annoying her hair was bothering me the whole movie and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part i agree with another review who said what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar '' let alone on a date with a human it was gross i would not recommend this movie entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy
nope it is not funny some people might not consider me qualified to review this as i did not even finish watching it but personally i was highly offended madea is nothing more than violent and abusive end of story once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child i had to turn it off as i was highly disturbed who promotes this as being funny that is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids and as a teacher and former camp counselor i have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way i am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse and all the other scenes were extremely boring do not watch this movie unless you think abuse is funny and then you are just sick
to charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any tv series is a crime in this case it only adds insult to injury this tv show was never fully appreciated much less promoted in it 's original run which coincided with the early years of the simpsons but that can be credited to fox television 's still relatively early unsure of itself years when it was n't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing nevertheless that 's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its dvd release chris elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks 30 year old paper boy it gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on david letterman who can forget the man under the stands and his marlon brando routines on that show watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in cabin boy '' again another unappreciated work the wit and sarcasm are the same as is the way he irks those around him including his own folks which includes his real life dad bob elliott of classic old time radio fame and elanor donahue of father knows best '' and andy griffith '' where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named ellie i give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves which was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around elliotts ' delivery and humor on that it should get a 5 but the collection offered here is a disgrace this show ranks as one of the top 2 tv shows to get cut short before given a fair chance along with police squad '' which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via the naked gun '' movies elliott deserved better than just cabin boy '' towards that end try again on the dvd release boys either do it right or it should n't have been done at all
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50 's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man with firth as the anchor of the team the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives but i found truth '' confusing and unengaging i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo and as several have noted lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible give this one a pass
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
the movie overall is really a great story the quality of the dvd is what really is what i find as poor quality it 's almost as though some one copied it using a video camera recorder i already own a copy of the vhs tape and it is a far better version of the film the actors are classics i can only say good things about maureen o'hara and tyrone powers ward bond also there were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of americana that deserves remembering
i 'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming but i feel ripped off just the same
this movie is basically about 12 old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 old worries about getting out of this small '' i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie
the dvd for the golden coach '' is for the most part fine but the final minutes which are crucial to the full impact of the film are ruined by deplorable mastering the scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening i believe criterion made some kind of mastering error because martin scorsese 's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film criterion should withdraw the dvd and offer a replacement
admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads '' is colossal torture like status elipticus it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums do n't take my word for it watch it yourself and see
i saw this with a group of strangers with candy fans and everybody was pretty disappointed each scene of the series was overflowing with humorous touches the film is strangely sedate at the same time a ton of jokes are lifted straight from the television show the things they do n't lift are missed why did they swap gerri 's manically comatose father for dan hedaya laying peacefully in bed
i have to disagree with the other reviewers i enjoyed the series and probably saw most of the episodes but this was n't worth the time
i read the statement will send in two to three business days it 's been almost one month i never received the video i 'm not happy
the series is brilliant this dvd release is not both the original and the replacement that amazon sent me were defective scenes would skip certain episodes would stick '' every few seconds some episodes and special features would n't play at all and would just kick you back to the main menu and disc 1 on both copies was completely unplayable i would get can not play disc '' errors i was afraid that maybe my dvd player was being finicky but then i bought the individually released seasons through amazon marketplace sellers and ebay they play just fine with no problems i 'm not sure what happened with this release and why there are so many glitches but my recommendation is to find some copies of the originals and buy those they 're always some used copies floating around on amazon and ebay mine are used and they play great btw you get pretty much the exact same extras and features with the releases with the exception of maybe a couple of things so you 're not really missing a whole lot plus the boxes are sturdier
i have now received 2 copies of this dvd and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly my personal favorite is the episode were jerry is trying to become homecoming queen it skips a whole chapter the weesle the chicken maybe the best comedy i have ever seen please check your copy and see if this happens it is not the fault of amazon it is a bad transfer to dvd that needs to be fixed if you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene and skip to the next chapter to see the chapter go backard 1 chapter i have had the same problem on all dvd players
i was excited to see this until i found out which movies would be included weird science come on it should have been the breakfast club pretty in pink and elmo 's fire
this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it 's trying to convey it 's lost in the plotless story
i loved the first movie and i 'm sad i ca n't say the same here as rene rodriguez of the miami herald put it the worst kind of sequel the kind that exists only to give you more more more of what you particularly liked about the first film without ever justifying its own existence indeed in my view dead man 's chest was just that and it did n't please me nearly as much as the first what the filmmakers did was listen closely to what audiences said about curse of the black pearl the audience liked the swashbuckling action the audience like the humor and of course the audience capt jack sparrow the filmmakers took this feedback and tried to incorporate these things into dead man 's chest oh boy did they try way too hard it shows swashbuckling action let 's give them a sword fight between the three main characters that lasts twice as long as it should swashbuckling action check humor let 's bring back pintel and regetti the comic relief of the first movie and make them a bigger part we do n't have to explain how they got out of jail and why others of barbossa 's crew did n't we do n't have to explain why they both vow to help bring jack sparrow back when in the first movie they helped maroon him and almost shot him they 're funny that 's what the audience wants and hey lets have most of the cast on an island inhabited by cannibals we can have jack roasting on a spit then have it become a shishkabob later we can have the crew in hanging cages swinging back and forth and rolling downhill in them this whole scene of the movie will be utterly pointless but it give them the laughs they want humor check jack sparrow we 'll have plenty of him but just doing these silly loony stunts not putting him in different critical situations that display his cunning and convincing negotiation skills and his and what of the central threatening situation whether it was escaping from a sinking dory or fighting a ferocious battle with his former first mate or facing death by hanging jack was always calm cool and collected not this time so what if it goes against him as one filmmaker said himself always believing that if he can just hang on long enough that everything will eventually turn in his favor make him visibly afraid make him panic at the sight of a black spot on his hand make him cringe at the first sight of davy jones yes jack sparrow 's mannerism will be a bit different this time but its johnny depp in the same pirate costume it should satisfy the audience jack sparrow check but what of the other things that make a film good things like say a story aware that the film did need a tale to tell the filmmakers decided the plot '' of dead man 's chest would be four individual dilemmas thrown clumsily together cutler beckett wants jack sparrow 's compass why we 'll have to wait for the movie to find out norrington seeks to restore his career to it 's previous glory will and elizabeth must get beckett what he wants in order to escape the hangman 's noose and jack sparrow attempts to weasel out of a bargain made with davy jones what does this all come down to only one character accomplishes what set out to do in the whole 2.5 hours norrington brought davy jones ' heart to beckett but will had to steal the key from jones first that 's the only thing that actually gets done in the movie how could that have taken 2.5 hours to do it did n't then what filled up the extra time the pointless stuff i mentioned above as ty burr of the boston globe put it it goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2.5 hours to get there i 'm not someone whom filmmakers can show three men and a group of savage cannibals chasing someone down a beach and expect me to be impressed there needs to be a point something to it all as dana steven of slate put it without a beating heart at its center this chest feels empty indeed one star for effort and for davy jones ' creative design tentacles for a beard nice
what a disappointment ! i absolutely loved the black pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel as it turned out i had every reason to be it whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original major or minor who seemed interesting that they did but unfortunately the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while keira must have somehow pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie legolas i mean orlando bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along sometimes good but more often haphazardly to my mind the only real interesting addition was that of davey jones except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying due to the tentacles 'n all at least his was a unique addition to the movie i do sort of object however to associating him with the flying dutchman legend the two have nothing to do with each other fantasy or not and do n't get me started on the cannibals ! any way i think this movie merits the two y'ars i gave it while considerably beneath that first movie it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times but it is most definitely not as good and as a final thought the very last scene of the movie lose it entirely it simply was unnecessary
if you are a casual cheap trick fan do n't buy this dvd the sound quality is poor and the performances are uninspired even the great bun e carlos seems to be just going through the motions '' after seeing an inspired cheap trick show in person back in the early this dvd depicts a mere shadow of the former band that i knew back then if you are a cheap trick fan it wo n't be total bust but i was n't happy with it if i 'm going to shell out money for these dvds i 'd expect a lot more than what i got in this case
this dvd release is from a lackluster performance by the band in sydney australia in 1988. to be fair i do n't know if it 's the band 's fault or production 's fault but something is wrong here the band seems uninspired the sound is not great at all far very far from it ! also the set list is short the feeling you will have is that this is no this band 's greatest performance by a large margin and you will wonder why if it was to release a live dvd they decided for this cold
i recently bought this dvd and was extremely disappointed the sound and light quality were both awful the band was totally uninspired this live effort pales dramatically next to live at budakon '' the voices are worn out the energy is gone it 's out of tune and the audience is minimally involved after watching it once it 's off to the dust bin ! for a much better live concert try queen live at wembley styx return to paradise or even journey 2001
i was very disappointed with steve 's performance eventhough it took a lot out of him to refrain from swearing his material towards the end of the show began to dwindle to the point that it just became plain ignorant especially in the part where he was expressing how he would kill someone '' and gloating bout it after i bought it i later caught it on a cable network god may not be through with him yet '' but it will be up to him steve to repent on his own this may be good humor for a more complacent christian audience
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
there 's a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel '' it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one her acting debut i 'll be there '' is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so seventeen years ago paul kerr craig ferguson of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert fast forward to the present kerr discovers that unknown to him his ex rebecca jemma redgrave gave birth to a daughter olivia charlotte church who is now a paper girl the problem is olivia has been kept a secret from her dad rebecca is embittered but kerr wants to get to know his daughter and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father music seems to be the thing that will bring the girl and the rocker together but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler who despite being only in her twenties has had an immensely interesting life well maybe someday she will get a biopic because i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way it involves a rock star and his daughter otherwise it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting with a forgettable script not much humor and a goofy premise the movie does n't have a lot going for it it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy scripted for church to act out and not a terribly interesting teenager either it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet as for acting talent she is bland at best but she does perform some good songs and her voice is as pretty as ever just watch the songs and her actual scenes redgrave does as good a job as she can and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker his is the only memorable role in the film and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film also known as the britney spears approach i 'll be there '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can
fresh horses on paper would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script you had molly ringwald with her porcelain skin and delicately curly hair you had andrew mccarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through you had a romantic triangle you had the class divide '' the brat pack was loved by millions how could this fail the problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves there 's very little energy '' at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural kentucky when her stepfather begins fondling her and her mother does little to help molly tries for the only escape she can find marrying the older viggo mortensen she claims she never slept with viggo only used him for escape then viggo 's father began fondling her and now she wants out of this house as well to get momentary relief from her homelife she hangs out at a friend 's home which is a 24 hour party here she runs into andrew andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his wealthy girlfriend the girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns having children and living the perfect life andrew goes with the flow until he sees molly and is instantly in lust molly leads him to believe she 's 20 single and interested in him it takes maybe 3 days before he 's sleeping with her to his credit he does tell his fiancee promptly and breaks off the engagement you 'd think everything was wonderful now right however andrew learns from friends about molly 's lies he decides to keep seeing her anyway however he does n't want to introduce her to his family and has no intention of marrying her he says he loves her but his feelings seem to be more related to sex at one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off there 's a telling scene near the end when andrew thinks molly has been publicly stripped by her husband andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with viggo andrew is deliberately rude laughing at viggo 's artwork and putting him down but it 's viggo who is the calm one here when molly shows up viggo points out that molly 's been doing all this lying and scheming so that andrew would be a knight in shining armor and ride off with her he asks andrew if you 're saying i 'm not good enough for her it seems that you think you 're too good for her right andrew finds himself agreeing that he wo n't take on molly himself he wants to get molly away from viggo but then is going to abandon her to her own means how could he figure that molly would be better off with nobody at all vs with viggo fast forward to a year later and molly has in fact found herself a wealthy college boy '' to take care of her and is taking classes again she 's happy and andrew is sad i suppose you have to give them credit for a hollywood ending to the story the landscapes are often gorgeous and the various details of high class low class city country are all played nicely against each other so the problem really comes down to the main actors molly and andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth you really get a sense of shallowness when you 're watching this movie andrew has an entire life including a romance that he 's set in in just 3 days he 's thrown it all away for molly but you never get any real sense that he cares about her molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life including seducing and lying to andrew in order to convince him to rescue her but she never seems to care much either intriguingly only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie one is ben stiller andrew 's best friend it 's ironic because ben 's character is shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him even so ben really seems authentic as someone who is n't used to having to worry about others but who really does try his best many times to get andrew to wake up to reality the other is viggo mortensen you only glimpse viggo once until the end of the movie he 's just referred to as a rough guy '' who has done many bad things when you actually encounter viggo after andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him you 're prepared for the worst however viggo is very patient very well spoken and quite intelligent in his commentary he does n't thrash andrew for sleeping with his wife instead he lays out the situation and makes both andrew and molly face their failings molly deliberately lied and used andrew as a tool of getting a better life andrew for his part knew he 'd never actually rescue molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her some have said this is the worst movie ever many sections of it can be very painful to watch however i do find glimmers of meaning especially in the ending discussion with viggo even there though you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for andrew and molly instead both seem to think yeah i guess that 's true oh well see ya '' i do n't mind gloomy movies at all in fact i really appreciate them sometimes however if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting it just makes the whole experience fall flat
this is seriously the worst movie ever the last time i saw it was in the theater and i still ca n't get over how bad it was in fact it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy we did n't speak for six months after we saw it together ! i too wish i could give it no stars and obviously people are n't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002 ! i ca n't believe you can even buy it on dvd
nope it is not funny some people might not consider me qualified to review this as i did not even finish watching it but personally i was highly offended madea is nothing more than violent and abusive end of story once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child i had to turn it off as i was highly disturbed who promotes this as being funny that is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids and as a teacher and former camp counselor i have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way i am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse and all the other scenes were extremely boring do not watch this movie unless you think abuse is funny and then you are just sick
i was into the concept the idea that memories which you no longer wish to keep can be permanently erased from your mind unfortunately by the time these scenes were shown i was sick and tired of the various characters they were whiney boring combative and very profane the r rating is well deserved at times i felt i would have very pleased if the entire cast almost had been rolled by a beer truck at least then the misery i was feeling at having to watch these neurotic would be over it did n't happen and some masochistic urge forced me to watch to the end to be fair there was one enjoyable area the tenacity and will of the jim carrey character in refusing to let go of the memory of the kate winslet character along with some nice special effects as this played out also the ending would have been very compelling if only i could have cared ! i did n't this should have been an excellent movie but was n't pity
not a good script kind of slow a regular movie if you are into history in america but if you dont live there or got any interest in this particular plot i wont recomended is borin
my twelve year old who read and loved the nesbit book five children and it hated this movie i have also read the book and the movie has very little in common with the original story there is no eccentric uncle and cousin horace or secret door in the greenhouse the children are not sent to the country because of the war even the wishes the children make are not true to the book my nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book so although it is pleasant clean family entertainment i think nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book it seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized nesbit 's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from lewis ' chronicle of narnia series
there are a lot of bad movies another most of them came out last year and many came out this year in fact 2005 's shaping up to be 2004 all over again 5 children and it proves this and makes me cringe for the future of movie making if this is what passes as a family movie these days not since a wrinkle in time quite possibly the single worst movie ever made even worse than elektra overdrawn at the memory bank van helsing and the day after tomorrow have i been so disgusted at movies making as a process 5 children and it further proves that all you need to make a movie is a plot some valuable lesson and a quirky creature even worse it features freddie highmore the most annoying child actor since haley joel osment i swear to god this kid signed a pact with the devil in order to become famous he was annoying in finding neverland a total darsh in charlie and the chocolate factory and even worse here why was this kid even hired he looks like the human incarnate of stewart little and apparently all it takes to make him is giving him old clothes giving anthony hopkins ratty clothes in hearts in atlantis did n't make him look like trash and it 's not working here the kid still looks like a snobby brat but that 's just one of many problems with 5 children and it i 'll get to the point and say that this movie is a for abusive parents in fact i may just buy this movie to use as discipline for when i have kids in the future and they do something stupid like kill someone or sleep with louie anderson also i pity eddie izzard if this is what his movie career has come down to i have n't read the book this is based on and have no intention of doing so after seeing this atrocity the movie starts out with 5 children duh huh porridge leaving their parents at a train station it 's taking place during either world war and so their father goes off to fight and the mom i do n't know leaves to discover her inner goddess or something the kids are sent off to distant relatives one of which looks an awful lot like a certain character in a series of unfortunate events the uncle is obsessed with math the aunt is off in her own world and their son is asexual he sports a mullet while at the same time looking like benjamin franklin while wandering around the house the children discover a door in the attic that leads to a beach this is almost a narnia when they waltz around the beach they dig up a big shell inside the shell is eddie izzard trapped inside a cg creature named it poor guy eddie brings this character to life with a disinterested tone of voice and doing his best impersonation of pepe the prawn of muppets fame it turns out that this guy can grant a wish each day since the children 's ' relatives gave them tons of chores to tend to they wish for these to get done it grants the wish and the children go back home well it granted their wish but not in the way they expected it made clones of the children to do the chores and of course they make more trouble than good in fantasia fashion they break dishes and screw things up there 's another any wish it grants fades away at sundown so all the clones fade away by evening and everything 's back to normal this happens a few more times with the wishes before the little benjamin franklin look alike gets suspicious and catches on there are a number of problems with the movie first is in the casting of the 5 children freddie highmore plays a total whiney idiot who constantly complains about how the wishes are greedy only to make greedy wishes himself at one point he makes a wish to fly away and see his dad in which it grants him magic cg angel wings that have the power to move at 8 frames a second from ms paint technology but because the kid 's an idiot he spends too much time flying around and the wish fades away before he can really do anything the other children are just around to give freddie someone to talk to the oldest boy is the typical older stronger character who somehow knows more than everyone despite having about the same knowledge of their situation the two girls are nearly identical in and there 's a baby boy who vanishes every few scenes when the kids venture into the city the baby 's kinda left in the streets to do his own thing and the next thing we know he 's being carried around i 'd then wonder where the hell he even was before that since no one was carrying him and how about those wishes that the kids make or how many it takes before they want to see their parents wishing for stupid gold to buy new dishes that their clones broke of which they never do and the relatives never notice is bad enough so why do n't they wish for something and poor eddie izzard he really sounds like he does n't want to be there never once does he seem happy or anything close to interested in his role maybe because he 's a cg monster with for most of the movie and then a puppet for the last segments or maybe he 's just plain drunk it is funny how all the good cg went into it and everything else got the short end of the stick though and finally the ending and its message any parent even a jenny jones guest one could do better if your kids are still watching the movie by this point i can promise you that they will hate morals from that point on the visual quality of the disc is pretty poor lots of grain and artifacting as well as some compression issues the worst parts are when cg is used like when the children walk down a staircase and several clones of little freddie highmore are on the staircase as well cleaning all of them look blurry almost like the production team was using a blue screen for the fist time as for the audio it 's all center focused and get has some static when a character screams loud how could something like this even get put into a final product special features apparently the production team never heard of those either all we get are subtitles in english french and spanish that 's all not even a trailer is included not that i 'm surprised i doubt the director and cast would 've done a commentary for such a horrible movie but you 'd think there 'd be even a 5 minute making of featurette included no such luck the disc 's a one side 's widescreen the other 's in full simply put if your children have already been punished with a wrinkle in time this is going to be the final nail in the coffin i honest to god do n't know why this was even made aside from reminding us that freddie highmore is in charlie and the chocolate factory god just look at the it even mentions that movie on the cover that 's probably the lone selling point of the movie stay away from it like gary busey 's teeth
i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time but now it is over definitely i disliked this novel and the movie is obnoxious rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies my conclusion this world is strange it has no idea what is good and what not
this movie has been terribly for reasons unbeknownst to me perhaps politically i presume in the usual hollywood fashion it has got to be one of the most boring uninteresting movies i have had the pain of having to waste my time on while attempting to sit through it however the one and only good thing about it is that ralph fiennes is in it but that is all do n't waste your money and time on this dud as i 'm sorry i did
this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery the politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray i can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script liberal student who has no clue about the real world 1 and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing bhlswhncatrw 2 interrupts evil corporation '' why are you being redundant the only plus for my wife and i was the acting which was great fiennes was especially good underplaying his character in the early parts of the film resulting in a character with depth and nuance i only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it
i 'm starting to appreciate john lecarre novels more than i did when he was all over the bestseller list this film version of one was acted well but in 30 minutes there just was n't anything to engage my interest not its characters and not its plot a good cause worth building a story around but not this story i quit watching so i guess i could be wrong but i doubt it
this movie starts off with a woman and a man kissing each other goodbye then the woman goes on a plane then it flashbacks to when they first met at his lecture his name is justin and her name is tessa tessa gets pregnant and after 9 months loses the baby i 'm not sure what tessa 's profession was nor am i interested but i think she liked going to other countries to help out certain people very slow moving and boring it kept going back and forth from flashback to present most of the time i would n't know what was going on
i was really excited to get this dvd set upon arrival i quickly popped it in my dvd player and watched attentively as i became very bored and very disenchanted the dvds are organized in to various chapters which sound interesting however the selection of artists seemingly do not fit in to the themes of the chapters i felt like the directors of the show were really stretching to make a connection within the topic of each chapter to the this dvd might give you some background of the world of contemporary art but it will most likely confuse you as it does to make a long story short i was looking for a dvd that would key me in on the artist 's but really this set only shows you a general overview of their art while focusing on the artist 's neuroses and not explaining the relevance of their works in recent history my suggestion is to forego this dvd set pick up a concise book on modern art and draw your own conclusions as you will
the first 13 minutes are of dance instruction but the rest of it is behind the scenes with no further instruction and the suggested dance moves were n't really for beginners but we did pick up a few things
the audio is hard to hear and the filming is hard to follow my children were not interested unimpressed and frustrated with the video a complete waste of money
there are two main female characters in the plot one is a who will sleep her way to the top although she may not even need it because she is good independently and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband 's this is a man 's fantasy and nightmare come true in one and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world to all the hollywood men out there you ca n't brainwash us anymore with your okay
admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads '' is colossal torture like status elipticus it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums do n't take my word for it watch it yourself and see
susan ward coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward then give this a movie a try if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future don '' t find it here
while i was watching this movie i thought to myself am i going to die have i gone to horrible movie hell '' you see i was trapped in a theater it 's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you ca n't leave cause b actors are pretending they can act just because they 're fat the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it 's grossly bright outside and it 's a sunday afternoon and you 're in a car and you 've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape in conclusion this movie turns me into melting snow but i suppose there are worse movies see my review on gummo
and this is one of them the characters were to silly to be funny musically shorts were dim animation was cheap usual for disney script was bad suitable for those 5 and under maybe
this movie is dumb it would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters and i think i saw this movie before it was called madagascar ! do n't get this movie ! it short and pointless if you want to watch something with your kids do n't pick this up i recomend chiken little or the incredibles ! sure chiken little might be short but atleast it tells about its characters ! i really do n't recomend this one at all ! do n't buy it watch it or anything else that is similer what a snoozer twenty bucks is such a loss
the wild '' is under the walt disney pictures '' banner and even rated g so i expected it to be a picture for the whole family of which the studio is proud i hoped it would put me in the disney mood prior to our family trip to walt disney world disappointed am it 's mediocre and has just about nothing in common with the walt disney legacy to be sure it is not unusually offensive the way the usually superb ron howard offended me with his witless and crude destruction of seuss 's how the grinch stole christmas '' it is just irritating and amateurish in its writing and direction for those of you who know something about animation has no one informed the director spaz '' his moniker or any of the animators the concept of the hold '' a hold '' in animation is when the movement stops for a moment to emphasize an expression or an attitude or a gesture it is priceless when used well and gives the animator a few frames worth of a break besides perhaps the all time masters of the hold in animation are chuck jones think of wile coyote and the road runner tex avery and bob clampett during the golden age of warner brothers cartoons the wild '' has a total of zero holds everyone and everything is moving times every second from movie 's beginning to end who can watch that my eyes just could n't take it the attitudes and gestures were all there they were just there ten times more often than any human mind could process but that could be forgiven if the story was clever conveyed a meaningful theme and was told with clarity drama and humor instead of clarity every sentence of dialogue was written to sound ironic or sarcastic or funny '' or witty '' never actually achieving real humor or wit it 's hard to know what any character really wants if they never express themselves clearly and simply i suppose once in a while they did but that was the exception there is no attempt to make the squirrel 's romantic crush remotely believable and the theme is trite as can be finally there is so much slapstick violence characters get hurt a lot that i almost question the g rating it 's a valid rating but the film is definitely too full of scares like the far superior the incredibles '' for anyone under age 7 this is not new in the disney tradition as snow white '' bambi '' sleeping beauty '' and maybe peter pan '' are also too intense for the very young there is no less artistry required to make a kid 's comedy animation than any adult movie in fact more awareness of one 's audience is required to make it entertaining and meaningful rather than irritating boring or traumatizing the theme of the wild '' trite as it is has potential value but it 's ineffectively communicated i think spaz '' and his crew believed they had a film so full of it would excuse the flimsiness of the story unfortunately they were mistaken this was not a pixar movie if you did n't figure that out yet the good news is pixar is back in business with disney and we can look forward to their consistently superior material which has already started with cars ''
i ordered these and several other movies from the tyler perry collection only to find that they were not actual movies but plays i returned them and was charged a high restocking fee not ok ! no where in the description was mention of them being stage plays i will order my cd 's and dvd 's from another source in the future
this is one of my favorite movies but i was very disappointed with the dvd version in the middle of the movie you will have to get up go to your dvd player and flip the dvd over to the second side to see the rest of the movie i do n't know what bozo came up with that idea but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie who wants to get up and flip the dvd over in the middle of the suspense this format takes stupidity to the next level i would highly recommend the vhs since i have it and it 's wonderful i would not recommend the dvd until they do a better version the packaging is in paper and not durable at all another truly bad idea dvd 's should be in plastic cases not paper
this movie comes from john grisham 's novel of the same title most of the actions taking place in the novel were also presented in this movie the spotlight reviews goodly summarize the movie even when i do n't agree with their rankings the first movie 's problem is the character 's personalities less credible many times one reviewer well said the fbi 's personnel looks rather wimpy the merciless coal fletcher looks like a simple clerk while he is the real president in the novel on the other hand the novel 's heroine darby shaw losses her strong personality but at the same time behaves in obnoxious ways for example in one scene she asks her best female friend to spread a gossip in college but darby does not care whatsoever for her friend 's safety as in the novel darby even tells her that it 's not good for her darby to stay there '' darby does all the opposite in the novel next her friend does all what she says this not credible the second movie 's error is the way the show the events for example as i said fletcher is not portrayed as a tough way there 's even an scene where we see his seeing his family 's picture at his desk really charming however he is still punished in the movie any honest person who does not let to be impressed by the reputations of the actors and director should admit that the movie is not always understandable i watched this movie right when released in 1992 and i did n't understand it but the huge julia roberts ' success was on its highest so i did n't think much just considered it was sort of boring now i read the novel watched the movie again and understood the movie was flawed in fact all bad guys in the movie were only small fishes who chased darby i also complain that the movie shows some misbehaviour as good ones for example in one scene the president asks the fbi chief voyles to stop a crime investigation voyles offers to do it in exchange of favours this is plain corruption yet the movie made it look like a cocktail party ! in another scene one character callahan is about to start driving while drunk and darby only plays a little bit to stop him just to finally let him get on his car the movie added a few action scenes the novel does n't have yet it is quite boring the novel has less action yet it is more exciting
so i can see there are some julia roberts fans out there too bad just raving about her will never improve her acting skills an oxymoron actually the poor quality of this movie is astounding considering its director the cast excepting our girl julia and the book upon which it was based though he 's done some much better work when pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing hmm 'presumed innocent ' was a winner let 's follow that same formula and do another one it 'll sell '' unfortunately by the time the story from the book by john grisham got to the screen it lacked any of its original punch as for denzel he should be ashamed of himself he 's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach i guess he probably needed the cash for another house then again he 's opposite julia no further comment needed than save your money
do not buy ! ! ! great movie bad studio ! ! it has been announced that new line is replacing peter jackson as the director of the hobbit the only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet do not buy or see anything new line till the hobbit is returned to its rightful director ! ! !
the lord of the rings i was a teenager back in the mid and late and jrr tolkien 's popularity was inescapable i started reading the hobbit which is a little prequel to this i do n't think i finished it and i know i never tackled the lord of the rings i found tolkien hard to read imaginative sure and no doubt thematic but it was like margaret mitchell unreadable do n't start i 'm from the south later i saw an animated version of the trilogy on tv which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes naturally it made no sense because you ca n't compress all that into such a short time span then i gave up on tolkien and played another game of dungeons dragons i was addicted folks role playing games are an author 's playground i did n't play as much as i wanted because i was too much in demand as a dungeon master naturally but now in this millennium let 's watch some movies ! i live in china where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan for those keeping score at home about us 2.50 the fellowship of the ring it was a bit slow getting started presenting all the back story but i was surprised later on when i needed it and remembered it so well okay yep tolkien 's got game given his popularity one would sincerely hope so you absolutely have to love the look of middle earth how are they able to adjust everybody 's heights most of the special effects are impressive most importantly somehow i feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to tolkien 's vision in fact i read somewhere that he did i never found elves quite so annoying in my dungeons dragons days as i do now i bet they never sweat do they they talk in riddles and glow too much but i guess that happens when you live too long the various species are quite distinguishable are n't they so are different members of the same species this is masterful it 's a skill far too few modern authors possess either everybody in the book seems like the same person or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that yes sometimes it 's reassuring to a to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require once our fellowship finally goes into battle we get some great sequences among many fine performances those of frodo and gandalf stand out in my mind oh and never toss a dwarf '' which i know tolkien did n't write anxiously awaiting part two the two towers what 's more boring than real world politics fictional politics ! i do n't believe tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect well i hope he did n't saruman makes a bunch of and sics 'em on humanity fine we do n't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles nor do we need the lamest excuse for a love story '' in cinematic history but once we finally get past all that i believe we get back to the tolkien vision here 's hoping we stay there for part three two hours two paragraphs what 's wrong with this picture the return of the king a balanced attack that 's what the two towers lacks but the return of the king has by this i mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring that 's not your action '' unless your name 's jackie chan give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater no hate mail from jackie chan fans please i love shanghai noon the real drama comes in the interpersonal and in frodo versus that ring gollum is one freaky deaky ai n't he liv tyler is still unwatchable but fortunately her screen time was minimal we get very close to the end of this film before hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes those very cool elephants for example seem unstoppable i was quite impressed with orlando bloom 's quietly effective performances but i 'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas those elephants are doomsday machines and the heroes ' strongholds were hiroshima and nagasaki meanwhile back at the ranch perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility sam the hobbit versus how many orcs um lest we forget he 's only a freakin hobbit ! i do n't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps tolkien himself but well somebody damn sure did let 's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what 's on the other side unlike some critics i appreciated that this film did n't end at the climax '' we needed some more time to just hang out in middle earth well over 9 hours after we entered the place without all that fx crap however anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead and that includes the entire elven race you can leave your shire without leaving your world tolkien i did i 've been in china since 1999. the verdict i appreciate tolkien 's imagination and i 'm glad the film people made this but i know it could be so much better with an editor yeah i 'm talking about changing what tolkien wrote if required there goes another subscriber i read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they do n't think tolkien wrote enough i disagree i think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better and there goes another subscriber nothing about this movie changed my opinion i was happy to watch it once but i ca n't imagine anyone wading through it twice i 've swapped it for a copy of the godfather trilogy which i 'll review in a future issue of who moved my rice
i like the trilogy but i am waiting for a replacement set as the second dvd the two towers is defective any chance of getting the new set soon if not for that problem i would rate the trilogy 5 stars
this is a pure from the cover of aerosmith 's live bootleg album from 1978 where 's the shame too bad twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover in another words this dvd is pretty suck and the originality here is nowhere to be found especially on the cover art that they stole from a much bigger band
nearly 3 hours of posturing bad accents except for jack thompson why it is only brits aussies can do justice to a southern accent spacey doing his usual smirky cryptic shtick cusack his typical jittery the inclusion of lady chablis seems gratuitous a kind of synthetic shock element for viewers who need pc frissons which kind of sums up the whole movie for me
clint eastwood 's work directed and produced midnight in the garden of good and evil '' has always made an impression on me kevin spacey has always delivered fine acting performances and john cusack always entertains kelso john cusack gets assigned to cover a party of williams kevin spacey the movie ambles along and eventually gets lost williams turns out to be gay and kills his lover the subsequent movie ends up as trial for murder and the surrounding details a transvestite lady chablis adds a humerous note to the movie that tries very hard to be stoic a juju woman minerva also dogs the movie doing strange things and having midnight parties at a graveyard i caught myself laughing several times and then stopped wondering should i be laughing john cusack was great in better off dead '' or high fidelity '' his characterization of kelso is weak and i keep seeing the same qualities under the surface his performance in mitgogae is unfortunate and poorly placed it adds another strange layer to a movie that ca n't decide whether to laugh or cry this movie has too many threads loose and ends up being a nervous mess although the plot and movie itself seem very simple on the surface
first off special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality but at least this is better than the abomination that was jaws the only dinosaur movie i can think of that 's worse than this is raptor which consists of parts of the three carnosaur movies cut pasted together it has some redeeming feature in that ian malcom and john somedoy i forget his last name the guy who owns the park were actually interesting characters i guess steve speilberg finally realised that attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey 's rear end about unfortunately the boring stereotypical alan grant was the central character in this if you want to watch a steven spielburg movie that 's actually good watch or something or the lost world jurassic park '' even though recommending a sequel may seem lame the sequel is a million times better than this if you want to see a dinosaur movie then watch either the sequel to this movie or arthur conan doyle 's the lost world '' i would also recomend the 'carnosaur ' movies but i think they 're out of print if you want to see a movie where sam neill plays an interesting chracter watch 'in the mouth of madness ' or 'triangle' but definitely avoid this movie the only reason i even own it is because it was sold in a box set with the lost world jurassic park
shame on talented actors like maura tierney and jerry orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it star '' john romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time and this is his only film and i can see why he plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by tierney who also works in a local factory run by orbach dennis christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator and june lockhart and lyle waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as tierney 's estranged parents the movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it 's so shoddily included it makes no statement at all little heard of movie i can see why
cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance '' the dancers are all talented if hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough if you 've ever watched a competition and does n't need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess
the cover of this dvd states that the available sound tracks are dolby digital 5.1 english and japanese and english and japanese stereo alas the sound is only in dts for japanese i do not have dts so trying to listen to it produces a loud pop then no sound whatsoever very disappointing to say the least now i 'm forced to watch with english which i never do with material boo hiss
okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as bring it on '' clueless '' mean girls '' and especially the superior heathers '' is painting a false picture of what this movie i 'm sorry but john tucker must die '' is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films these other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers jtmd '' appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to and wonder is all i did this film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all the results are one big mess 2.5 stars is all i can the other films mentioned above are the ticket heathers '' 5 stars mean girls '' 4 stars bring it on '' 4 stars clueless '' 4.5 stars all four of these movies have something that john tucker must die '' doesnt
never mind 's that it 's pretty stupid john tucker must die '' like a lot of movies about actually hates high school and just about everybody in it and by extension american kids it 's the kind of movie that if parents caught an hour of it would make them think less of their children for watching it and to a fearsome extent pretending to live it out early in the movie one character a cheerleader remarks about stealing her mother 's estrogen pills well guys use steroids to build their pecs '' that estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader 's breasts is laughable but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them that could be most casual sickening line of the year but it is what to expect from hollywood screenwriters in their who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild girlie comedy not unlike those fabulous laguna beach '' hacks who use insidious and i mean insidious editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched again and again in the sloppiest manner to the previous line of dialogue jtmd '' asks us to believe that the title character jesse metcalf simultaneously dates three women ashanti sophia bush arielle kebbel without them knowing it is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town owns a great car stays in hotels for basketball road games and my personal favorite owns and drives a yacht he and his brother have no parents to speak of neither do the three girls unless you count the cheerleader 's mom reference one of them bush is an avowed vegan vixen however and when they discover they 've all been dating the same guy in gym class they get in a brawl and are not suspended but sent to a detention without a teacher is this a satire as jtmd '' bills itself an edgy comedy a smarter cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline in this world for looking at each other funny and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news a cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete but say head of the drama club a cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase brat girls but sweet emotional sunny girls a cleverer film would know a dark comedy if that 's what jtmd '' intends to be ca n't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven instead we have a fourth smart '' girl brittany snow is introduced as the girls ' grand taming of the shrew '' plan to woo john and eventually stomp his heart this angel of course begins to fall for john who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy which are if we follow our mtv two of the trinity the last being sheer cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have preferably brown that makes up male desirability director betty thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading in an empowered open society that has a foreign hindu woman as ceo of pepsi represents the canopy of female of achievement go figure you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid ! we 've been pounding this earth for years now why do teens and young women still trail along lapping it up there is no real wit in the movie that you ca n't see from some comic being fed lines on a program no style no genuine attitude it 's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty young rotten unidealistic america most interested in getting tail getting even and throwing parties it is not immoral so much as it blank a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic most involving of young bodies what fools hollywood sees our children to be wants them to be what numb donkey fools if you need more proof jenny mccarthy has been cast as the voice of reason and she 's borderline believable ya know so much ugliness is spewed about islamofascists '' these manaical stoneaged fiends who apparently ca n't tell you the sky is blue spending most of their time taping martyr videos finding mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life consider though that one of the more recognizable items in muslim countries is the satellite dish a year from now this thing 's on a movie channel and well whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the american decline into shame they 've got it not because it 's absent morals but humanity the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless
the whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer in short the disjointed story line goes like this troubled teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit whose face resembled iron maiden 's eddie ! who gives him he escapes death a jet engine crashing through his roof because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny he discovers some old hag named roberta sparrow he knew was an ex teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes ' same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected ' are you still with me ! ! ! i love and fiction but all this is beyond ridiculous ! that my friends is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens ' film is about ! i mean 'gigli ' was a better film for chrissakes ! even the time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable in the end the only redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like the church duran duran joy division and tears for fears hardly enough to save the film though if you must rent 'dd ' if your curiosity is piqued but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your or your parents ' money
well it did n't appeal to me personally story the characters no usually i am such a big fan of steven spielbergs ' various masterpieces and despite always '' i 'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies and so well jaws close encounters schindlers ' list minority report name it ! the man is a genious no argue there this movie simply has n't got the touch nor the style
this tape definitely provides a good workout but it lacks any kind of excitement there 's no complexity to the moves and i do n't find kathy smith to be an inspiring or engaging leader i would not recommend this tape for anyone who 's been stepping for more than a year
i agree these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason they are not that good ok there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying i love charlie murphy and the ashy guy and i think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny dave come back to tv
it just does n't work that well these skits are so obviously the versions or nevermind '' sketches that they never would have made it on the air if they were surrounded by the material of previous seasons these episodes admittedly house several moments and even some great stuff i too very much enjoy the tupac song but the quality is under par far under what one would expect even from an unfinished project like this one i recommend seeing them just because they 're funny enough to be worth the time to watch them but also because it does provide some closure for those of us who have been attached to chappelle 's show at the hip for a couple of years
i gave this dvd a chance being a big fan of not only the show but dave chapelle in general the skits on this disk were only moderately funny and without an intro by dave they were just dissapointing i could see buying this dvd to complete a collection but for entertainment value it falls way short of the mark the skit about mtv cribs was indeed funny but not worth buying the disk for i hope to see dave do some more standup he 's is definately one of the funniest men of our time
the title says it all reguardless of why dave left these episodes '' if you even want to call them that should have stayed lost but because of dave going mia and seeing as how viacom wants to cash in on the popularity they released not even subpar material if i was rick james i would be spinning in my
bad plot bad acting bad filming the surprise ending was a surprise because i had nearly terminated this boring stupid film long before the actress playing the little girl was especially poor
are you kidding me 4 stars this tells me that the rest of america all youz guys are getting real dumb you should be ashamed to rate this bomb a 4 star movie how annoying was the lead actress the jerky filming avante garde not dumb plot not much better than it was all just a dream do n't rent it ! scrap it i hated it
q the winged serpent was one of the worst movies i have even seen i went into the film knowing it was a b movie '' but still wanting to be entertained i was not entertained for a 1982 film the gore in q the winged serpent probably shocked quite a few people there is also a scene that is quite enticing but aside from these two points of note the film offered little else including entertainment the acting was passable but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out the ok acting goes to waste save your money this is one of the worst movies ever made there are far better b movies it is the type of movie i would have liked in college in 1987 if i had been drunk and looking for laughs but this is 2006 and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity you wo n't like q the winged serpent at all even for the drunk college student there are far better ways to spend 90 minutes stay away total score out of 100 7 2 out of 50 enjoyment a rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film 4 out of 10 acting how good was the acting 1 out of 10 immersion did the movie suck me into the story 0 out of 10 intangibles special effects movie pace is the movie forgettable or something you will talk about and remember for weeks years 0 out of 10 must see is this movie worth 0 out of 10 must buy is this movie a must
q larry cohen 1982 i have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes unfortunately to say q has n't aged well is being quite kind quetzalcoatl the title character is a very large who 's flying around new york eating people who find themselves in high places at least he might be quetzalcoatl an aztec god or he might just be a big mutant no one knows more to the point no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off new yorkers the cops assigned to the case shepard david carradine and powell richard roundtree certainly take things in stride the commissioner malachy mccourt frank 's brother is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events disbelief while the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story its actual core is jimmy quinn a young michael moriarty a crook who 's run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own jimmy 's odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller and there are glimmers of that sort of thing but the script never follows through q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface the special effects are alarmingly and hysterically and the characters were they to stand still could often substitute for props but hey it 's got a big flying lizard that 's something
this is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 new york there are generous aerial views lots of location shooting etc than as a horror movie even a cheesy one the special effects are used extremely sparingly with the word special '' being a definite overstatement some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings but not by much in the end q the winged serpent '' is watchable and certainly not horribly bad but it 's hard to imagine this being anybody 's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure to end on a positive note the dvd features a clean sharp print of the film
i watched both seven brides for seven brothers '' and its documentary making of '' and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers particulary the incredible tommy rall looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film i came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb i decided to purchase the film then i noticed the cover i thought is this what i think it is and clicked on 'see larger image ' yikes ! it is ! i have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational to say the least after just having placed hands are not for hitting '' on my wish list ! if warner bros decides to change the illustration on the cover then i 'll consider buying it until then for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see i suggest you view the 'see larger image ' of the cover before you decide to buy
the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs on which the sound is perfect so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
but is is not the truth since the wall fell we have learned that old joe was right hey i bet in a few years clooney will make a film about how honest and truthful bill clinton was
the lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real edward murrow and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the but otherwise i 'd did n't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short boring movie that seemed much longer maybe i 've just seen too many biopics lately
doris why did you star in this movie it is obvious the script was no motivation workers are sabotaging the plant because they want a raise ! were you in need of movie residuals that badly watching this movie is both painful and embarassing if anyone in their right mind walks in while you are viewing it they are bound to ask what in the world are you watching '' i could only imagine what it must be like to have a fantastic career tarnished by staring in it i just could not take it in one sitting shock and disbelief prompted me to repeat my transgression by viewing in small doses it took three attempts during a week of persistence and hot coffee to endure the relentless routines every other word triggers synchronized bellowing with cartwheels and taps in this musical for its time some of the choreography may be good but there is so much of it 23 the story which is weak to begin with is buried on average there is two minutes of acting between each song fortunately doris day was prolific enough that the pajama game does not mar her good reputation the redeeming value of the movie is her flattering haircut teacher 's pet the man who knew too much send me no flowers day and lover come back are all delightful this is precisely the reason i was so shocked with the pajama game if you want to see a good musical watch singin ' in the rain west side story or close your eyes and pick another day film you could not do worse i expect most of my films to be four or more stars because i read and trust the reviews of others before purchasing this was one case where i was totally fooled even with bob fosse and carol haney there is no way i can conceivably recommend this film with more than two stars despite the anticipated negative votes from devoted day fans i may hopefully save others from bitter disenchantment
i now know why i had not heard much about this movie only buy it if you like broadway musicals because it is not your typical doris day movie i feel like i am watching parts of monty python and the holy grail when the prince says i just want to sing ''
having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesday '' unbiden into our aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said hey this book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor 's well they filled up the space look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial presenter will somehow make it all for one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry
i own howl 's moving castle '' amd spirited away '' by miyazaki and bought nausicaa '' mainly because of the customer reviews one of the best films of any type ever made '' greatest animated film of all time '' best movie i 've ever seen '' please help me ! this film story is about a young female heroine who ca n't afford underpants with a good heart and a desire to stop all killing in a future world dominated by giant worms and a worm is a perfect mascot for the tedious snail crawling pace of this film everyone viewing almost fell asleep the plot is slow to develop character development lacking and animation primitive at best of the three miyazaki films i own this is the worst does it matter who wrote the screenplay when you put your name on it it 's yours howl 's moving castle '' and spirited away '' which won an academy award have qualities that are totally lacking in this film these films had characters who 's evolution touched my heart a storyline which captivated me and animation that made me forget that this was animation not so with nausicaa '' the reviewer who claimed that this is one of the best films of any type ever made '' has obviously never seen gone with the wind '' ten commandments '' ben hur '' or even the wizard of oz '' the reviewer who stated that this is the greatest animated film of all time '' has probably never seen dumbo '' pinocchio '' or the new over the hedge '' or open season '' the animation of the bear fur is beyond realistic so if you 're an animation freak like i am and not someone who 's been paid by miyazaki to praise his inferior work who lets the eyes and heart decide what 's a good film and if you want good miyazaki film pass on this one if you want great animation buy dumbo '' or pinocchio '' and if you want great films buy any of the classics like the four movies mentioned before or king kong '' godzilla '' or any of the other top 100 films listed by the american film institute beauty is in the eye of the beholder '' so do n't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really do n't get out much ps used nausicaa '' for sale or trade
this review is more about the superbit '' transfer of the movie to dvd than the movie itself the movie itself is great and i highly recommend it however the transfer on to this 2002 superbit '' version is very lacking in several areas the superbit idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer the original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features like trailers documentaries featurettes and '' snippets to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality they have failed to do that here the video and audio quality are not what they could be first the movie is encoded onto a rsdl disc this means the dvd is capable of storing 9.5 gb of data however not even 6 gb is used as a result the video and audio quality is not what it could be panic room '' is a 112 minute movie any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a disc at maximum encoding rate provided no extra features are placed on the disc the maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour or less movie onto a disc is 9.8 mbps however this superbit version averages only 6.5 mbps this superbit version offers audio encoding in 3 types dolby 2.0 surround dolby digital 5.1 and dts at first glance this is great news until you discover that the dts encoding is n't as high quality as it could be the dd 2.0 surround is presented at a bitrate of as expected so is the dd 5.1 at the expected rate dts 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps this is unsatisfactory given the fact that of the available disc space of the is n't even used the dts encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this this would represent a 33 increase in filespace for the audio portion but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear the filespace increase would be only about 256 mb which is very reasonable when you have over 3 gb of space not even being used if they had encoded panic room '' on this superbit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 mbps and removed the trailers and features they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above especially the dts 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate i stated such an encoding process would have used 9.4 gb of the 9.5 gb of available space a much better way to fill up the disc and adhere to the spirit of the superbit ideal the result would have been a movie encoded to at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc i notice that they will be offering a repackaged superbit version in october 2006. hopefully that version will fix the flaws i just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both and it might even offer the better 6.1 and 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many receivers can process now another thing i am noticing is that many times for popular movies they are released them in editions the first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff if the movie contains both dd and dts encodings on the first disc with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 mbps or greater it is already in the superbit mold
jodie foster is one of the greatest actress 's ever period but this clunky film is so boring predictable that it just never gets off the ground put me to sleep a film full of cliches dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere
i got nothing to say was this supposed to be intense was this supposed to be a thriller it was boring horrible acting except for forest whitaker but even he could n't save this one pure fincher pure trash horrible horrible horrible quite possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i am just too upset to type i ca n't believe i actually waisted my time with this
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here crash '' comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world '' my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here 's a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i do n't like any of these people so their pain does n't mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would 've worked but now there just is n't anything there as far as what 's actually in the movie we 've got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we 've got jared 's mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto 's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there 's no real attempt to make wayans into a person he 's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that 's it the doubly sad fact is that he 's the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it 's a wonder that the smack does n't cause them to cease to exist entirely well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually the bergman films i 've seen so that 's not really a fair comparison they love each other apparently but since i do n't even like either of them i 'm not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it would n't have been funny if i cared about her but we 've been over that and i want you people to know that i 'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie 's dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting '' which has characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba '' a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream '' so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that 's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream '' is n't helped any by darren aronofsky 's repetitive derivative the trouble is this movie has n't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they 're hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see a thousand times montages a million times and plenty of wonky junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai n't drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that does n't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky was n't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters were n't going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that 's a good ending grade ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows
i give this film one star for the acting which is often very good however the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness and debase every aspect of lower income urban people in all honesty i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film against my better judgement still if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty then i recommend a streetcar named desire '' kids '' last exit to brooklyn '' and traffic ''
i stopped watching this after the first episode the animation is nothing like the movie gits also there is quite a bit of cgi used in the series the music was nothing like the original and the actors who did the english dub sounded corny to me the only similarity between this and the movie is the premise and plot all of the atmospherics are gone there are numerous still shots where only the mouth moves this is a very tame and uncreative version of ghost in the shell all in all if your a die hard fan i guess you will like this no matter what if you expect a lot as i did you will be diappointed
from a parents view i definetly thought this sequel was violent compared to the first one we saw this at the the theater and almost had to leave if your expecting this to be just like the first one you 'll be upset for a family with young children i would suggest renting this before you buy it
terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid
the total absence of normative values makes for tedium and revulsion not for greatness nor even for that matter for titillation when even incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference it becomes easy to see why the french are exterminating themselves by refusing to reproduce themselves at the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family the french nation will be gone in another few generations this movie will help the viewer see why sociologically and philosphically interesting in that it epitomizes the banality of evil and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig secularism is devoid of soul and offers nothing to live for nothing to live by
this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women '' is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all 5 inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women '' is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are and fun there 's dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man 's vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife catherine deneuve and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the mark i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience
this movie is typical hollywood trash the show biz '' liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers '' a much better and far more honest film
shortened version do n't buy this dvd unless you have an incredible memory long version my daughter started playing the dvd and sat and waited because the actual dancing part was n't for a bit when the actual dancing part happened paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it of course my daughter could n't keep up then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it after my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part paige told us to put it all together and do both parts and yet again my daughter could n't keep up it was when my daughter was watching paige demonstrate '' the moves before doing them that i realized that my daughter is n't getting much excersize out of the dvd i would not recommend this dvd to anyone especially to little kids who would definetly not keep up to paige 's high memory rate
when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media
i was not impressed at all with this video the women who do the various facial exercies do not even smile and scared my son the first few times watching it it is poor quality no originality and there is nothing i see that is going to help at all that i already do not do with my son
the idiots have struck again ! ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv they all insane ! ! ! if i had n't opened it i would return it to amazon now ! a flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way the directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools ! do n't buy it
the film deserves 5 stars but the dvd only gets 1. why no letterbox format after waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on dvd why would they give us full screen pan scan yes the quality and color are great but oh what we 're missing on the sidelines
if you are expecting great insight into the lives of national geographic 's photographers or even revelations about what makes great photography then look elsewhere this video greatly disappointed me as it is nothing more than promotional drivel so fawning and servile is the narration that each sentence sounds as if it is about to collapse under the weight of the compliments for the organization it reminds me of these terrible the making of '' tv programs the have now to promote movies it should be given free with subscriptions and not charged for it is short and shallow and holds about 15 minutes in total interest for any photographer buy the magazine or one of their books instead
unfortunately this freshman effort from maria maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances two girls in love '' is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment for a more believable as well as more intelligent and erotic young lesbian love story check out the understated and bbc production my summer of love '' 2004 a similarly themed film that 's downright hilarious and with a killer score to boot but i 'm a cheerleader '' 1999 is a gem from the same year better than chocolate '' has it all humor originality plot dialogue performances and sensuality the only incredible thing about two girls in love '' is that it got released in the first place as without its lesbian twist it 's little more than a romeo and juliet tale
many people had reccomended this movie to me but it failed to live up to its reputation the quality of the was aweful the acting bad to the point of utter ridiculousness and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers it gets some credit toward the end for showing some of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was there were some cute moments and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big l word ladies but do n't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product
i love leslie nielsen but this movie is not funny his better movies are wrongfully accused and the naked gun movies
leslie nielsen stars in spy hard what kind of a title is that
i am a big leslie nielsen fan i first saw him in the naked gun series which i thought was awesome then i saw him again in wrongfully accused i was so enthralled that i acquired airplane which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it i had thought he could do no wrong but he really disappointed me here what is wrong with this movie everything you will see in here are things you have already seen in other leslie nielsen comedy movies there are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it 's painful rather than funny for example the glasses my god when that was mentioned i just felt nauseous the problem with this movie is that it continues the naked humor but it does it rather badly most of the humor in this movie is and that will eventually get boring aside from that this movie lacks a proper plot all throughout the movie it does n't seem like dick steele nielsen did anything but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag nielsen 's other movies had bad plots too but at least they were coherent i am sorry mostly to myself for seeing this but this was just a bad movie perhaps the director should go watch the entire naked gun series to see how it is done
i love dave 's tv show it 's really hilarious so i was expecting a lot when i bought this dvd as part of a with richard pryor after 10 minutes of dave i started thinking when am i going to laugh '' after 20 minutes i got bored so i started listening to the audience for this live show they were laughing a little not all that often so i concluded that it was n't just my mood this just was n't funny after 30 minutes i turned it off i can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time even if you 're a dave fan as i am i ca n't tell you if the rest is funny or not because i did n't watch it maybe i was expecting too much maybe i was expecting richard pryor which i had watched first my recommendation is either to buy only the pryor dvd which is terrific or watch the chappelle dvd first so it wo n't suffer by comparison
a very disappointing performance by chappelle everything that makes killin ' them softly '' great is missing here dave does n't seem to be enjoying himself doing standup in this show the jokes are n't sharp and he lacks the energy he usually exudes there are some funny moments but i do n't know this just falls so short of everything else he 's done i love dave but i think the pressure of being funny and his show really took a toll on him by this point we 'll just need to look forward to chappelle 's show season 3 ! ! !
the jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of sight gags i normally would n't have bought a movie like this but i needed it to make my johnny depp library complete
private resort is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres however i 'm sure this film is one that johnny depp hector elizondo and rob morrow are n't proud to have on their resume the movie 's plot is slim and neither morrow or depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs but he 's not at his best either most of the film 's laughs come from leslie hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo dody goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and tony azito as a bumbling hotel security guard there 's lots of slapstick some of it works most of it does n't you can do better folks
i admit that i 'm a johnny depp fan but this was n't anywhere near one of his best he is adorable in the movie but the plot is extremely corny and i found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of girls but not much else although there are a few remotely funny parts it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is but then again it was worth it to watch johnny
i 'm still trying to come to grips with the final volume of wolf 's rain it reminded me of an entry in the friday the series it just seemed filled with gore and as if the makers of the show were looking to see how many different ways they could kill the beloved cast of this awesome show jaguara has been killed by darcia but darcia himself is quickly dying from being poisoned by her at one time he seemed like a sympathetic character trying to revive his lost love but in this volume he becomes a bloodthirsty murderer akin to freddy krueger and that 's what this volume reminded me of a hollywood bloodbath like texas chainsaw massacre but at least that movie had jessica biel yes everybody from the show is beaten and battered from the events of volume 6 and they 're all trying their best to make their way to paradise as the world slowly dies around them and that 's where the writers really kill this show ok when the first character dies it was touching but as they start dropping like flies it becomes exploitation of emotion and then there 's this whole one person is chosen to remake the world out of the throes of its death '' thing that has been done too many times in anime already see envagelion rahxephon scrapped princess etc i 'm kinda sick of the whole thing and the fact that once again you 're left wondering at the end of it ok what does the ending mean '' i can watch 2001 a space odyssey for that kind of experience what an awful way to finish a series that bordered on being a masterpiece just like evangelion the last episodes taint the entire run
this movie is one of the 3 movies i 've ever seen these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours and for chrissake he 's not an american
the movie itself was ok especially freddie bartholomew ' acting but spencer tracy gave a horrible performance i sure hope he did n't win any awards for this he does n't even come close to a portugese accent or any other kind of accent for that matter spencer tracy 's take on a portugeese accent is to talk in broken english like they used to portray the indian 's in the old westerns it comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english such as 'manuel no like you wish you not here ' it 's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making and then there 's the lack of realism half the time there is no one steering the ship in real life someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day on this ship no one steers at night when the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie in the distant shots it 's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea 's but when they close in on the actors the deck is n't moving at all they just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond and at the end of the movie when spencer tracy 's character is cut in half below the waist he 's not even in pain he survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head this is what really spoiled the movie the only saving grace is freddie batrholomew 's portrayal of harvey
this film is just like the the sixth sense film both films have the same borring plot the borring plot in the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them after the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last the sixth sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again if you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people you will love 13 ghosts that film is what i called a good ghost film
this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting especially the girls playing christy and ariel is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but could n't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but ca n't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i ca n't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house '' with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter 's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten '' this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of
'a mighty wind ' seems to be 'this is spinal tap ' done in a folk medium unfortunately the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted as another reviewer stated from most of christopher guest 's previous efforts to put it mildly halfway through the film i was and wishing a dwarf would crush stonehenge
after viewing the avengers with emma peel which i do every evening after the dreadful news enjoying repeats and repeats as well with reluctance i played the hospital dvd i thought it was terrible the diagogue idiotic i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana emma peel would have thrown him across the room i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd i see that this dvd was dated 1971 this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967. in hospital i believe she was 33 years old oh well i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel finall john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode perhaps they will issue hospital 11 and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series robert lyons reno nevad
the hospital '' as as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience it is not so much a dark comedy but a one i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's network '' and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness i 'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole if george 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding drinking or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant diana rigg is completely wasted in this film her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short and be ravaged by scott 's character the film is also not helped by the direction of arthur hiller the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
i have never not been able to sit through a rated g movie however my sister and i rented this thinking it would be a funny show and it was so terribly boring that i was forced to leave the room i could n't believe it because i love movies i can see how this movie would be funny for a 6 year old boy to watch but do n't count on the parents or older siblings being able to sit through it
no wonder they did n't produce any other live action productions of seuss books until after his death this film gave me a headache the direction and pacing of the film is flat the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring inexplicably nominated for an oscar ! the acting was wooden the sets were garish and ugly at least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of seuss works were i think seuss works best in small doses like the short animated tv shows that were made some years ago do check out the gerald '' cartoon thats included on the disc it contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than t '' does in ninety minutes
this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave
i laughed like a loon when i watched these shows as a kid my sides hurt and tears came to my eyes for years i told people that that this was the best most creative funniest show ever aired i tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but i never did suddenly i found this collection on amazon and i was in heaven when it arrived i ripped it open and started to watch i fell asleep before i got through the first episode i was crushed nary a laugh or even a snicker on the dvd truly disappoined after decades of waiting sigh !
i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family each of whom is brilliantly have series 3 4 and now want 1 n't wait any episodes of absolute delight await you
betty hutton has a colossal amount of energy she seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining she 's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers her voice is sturdy durable indestructible but oh my god her acting choices she and the indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film whereas buffalo bill allegedly a character looks like a corpse by comparison and howard keel in only his second film must manage to act like these are human beings he 's relating to take a look at betty hutton 's reaction upon seeing howard keel for the first time the mugging would be considered a bit much '' if seen from the back row of an amphitheater at best her performance is clownlike at worst it 's apelike little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity it 's a magnificent effort and a stunning testimony to her desire to please but her comedy has no reality no nuance no connection to any sincere emotion she seizes on hick '' and drives that into the ground then she plays nothing but infatuated '' for a while before toggling to resentful '' and so forth it 's a series of masks and set pieces but it 's not a character judy garland was in sad shape at that point in her life but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind annie 's moments and she would n't have neglected annie 's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes nobody can do vulnerability like judy and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors both qualities that would serve this character annie could be a wonderful character a great mess of strength longing guts femininity skill naivete and worldiness all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man but instead betty hutton makes her a crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet i am surprised that hutton did n't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out maybe they just would n't let her the scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide i kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on and the memory of betty hutton 's performance is branded on my brain but it 's because this performance seems like it 's following the traditions of some other culture some other world it 's like going to a sideshow that said the tunes are a parade of hits there probably is n't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another in wildly different styles with effective melodies worth remembering the classic tunes just keep coming the movie works as spectacle and songfest and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness but if you 're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes
can someone seriously explain how and why betty hutton became a star her one talent seems to be her volume she is entirely without subtlety sincerity honesty in her acting and is a mediocre singer she merely shouts the production numbers are well done and howard keel does well especially since he is playing opposite a fire engine siren
from a parents view i definetly thought this sequel was violent compared to the first one we saw this at the the theater and almost had to leave if your expecting this to be just like the first one you 'll be upset for a family with young children i would suggest renting this before you buy it
this dvd is fine for beginners who would like some stretching but there is no weight loss aspect to it i felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight
very beginner slow as can be if you are just starting yoga let this be your instructional dvd not for the experienced
why this woman starts yoga sitting on her legs is beyond me i did yoga in my younger years and did it at the integral yoga institute and went away from the practice for 20 years if this woman 's dvd is the new market of yoga it is a shame this is her version it stinks and is almost impossible fora 50 year old out of shape body to do much less lose weight by especially by starting sitting on your legs how absurd what a waste of money
this is the most boring unmotivating uninteresting workout i have ever owned yoga or other i am exceptionally disappointed as it was voted best workout dvd of 2005 by self magazine i have only been practicing for a few weeks having fallen in love with fit tv 's namaste workouts i expected the same great music flowing rhythm and steady pace instead this is an incredibly dull workout that does n't even challenge me a true beginner i adore yoga and wanted a longer challenging workout this is not it i 'm back to my free fittv namaste workouts until i can find somethng better
i was really impressed by how the movie looked visually but then i started to try and figure out what was going on in the story was extremely confused the reason i gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow i turned it off a little less then half way through
this movie is being described and sold as a comedy it is not one it has several funny lines but the movie is more of a romantic drama if you are looking for a comedy i do not recommend this at all
i like francois ozon 's swimming pool a lot i think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie but under the sand is a very typical french movie which makes most people do n't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a french movie i finally persuaded my husband that francois ozon is different and this movie will be good it turned out to be a nightmare pointlessly soul strangeling movie i would not recommend unless you are a big fun of ozon or this type of movies
i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more
michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great as this q and it 's alive 3 island of the alive how awesome is he anyways i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you should n't because not only is this a but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff '' started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth do n't be too critical on it what i learned from the stuff dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth ! if you like the stuff i recommend watching other such as island of the alive 3 zombi 3 and 4 etc
let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic regardless of the fact that it did n't stick with a few key plotlines in the book everyone still did a great job adapting the original jurassic park then came this piece of trash whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book this one just takes the brilliant writing of michael chrichton and throws it directly out the window first off john hammond is supposed to be dead he dies at the end of the first novel secondly ian malcome is supposedly dead or at least mia at the end of the first book and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the there is no bratty daughter and the entire premise has much more to it most importantly the entire ending in san diego with the which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies did not exist in the book ! i went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist and the anticipation of some good to top it off what i ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page not only that but because of the lack of plot the dino scenes are complete when you see so much of it you lose that awe and wonder of the first film when you see that brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film the wonderment is difficult to rival there are no such moments in this film if you 're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino fx go nuts however if you 're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline flick off the dvd player and pick up the book oh and one more thing do n't go near the movie they did n't even have a book to be untrue to i ca n't imagine how much more and rambling my review would be for that one
i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore yuck ! and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters stay goldblum the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better
i love er but do n't waste your money on this pilot issue if you 've got season 1. this is just the same as the first two hours of season 1. yes i did waste money on it because i read here that the pilot was different from the first show
i 'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick '' dick '' is funny this is not i 'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst or that level of indefatigable cuteness just go rent dick '' instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country
i first saw this film as a kid at the time i really enjoyed the movie it 's very colorful and i liked the tunes and it had stubby kaye what kid would n't like stubby kaye but i just purchased it out of curiosity and was pretty much floored by how bad this movie is the print transfer was great and the quaility and color are everything one could hope to see and if you like looking at very beautiful women in costumes that accentuate their best physical qualities then i have to say it fits that bill it 's worth the price just to see julie newmar as stupefyin ' jones however the movie just is n't worth the time the musical numbers are not very good the direction is n't what one would hope the casting was n't very good either with most performers seeming to stroll through their roles or in some cases just examples of some really bad acting yes it was caricature and an adaptation of a musical of a comic strip filled with fantastic folk but in some cases the portrayals were so as to induce groans one thing i was surprised to note was the brief appearance of jerry lewis i 'd forgotten that he had the cameo if you have some fond childhood memories of this movie then it 's worth a look or if you just want to see the faithful adaptation of the female comic strip characters to flesh and blood actresses then you 'll probably like it if you you 're looking for decent music and effective dance numbers and an enjoyable storyline then you wo n't care for l'il abner
the viuals were good the actors were bad and the story line just blows
i am a big fan of frank miller 's work and i loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from when i saw this film i was blown away by the visuals it had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything i had seen in a movie before having mentioned it 's good points i have to say i was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen it seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen for the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through i had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like i was being mugged what works in a graphic novel does n't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you 'll see here all the characters were severely and tragically with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience also many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film however my bottom line opinion is it 's a good film to watch for the visual look only but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute ' button on this film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark
before you vote this review down i ask that you fully read it so you can understand why sin city does not function as a good film sin city unfortunately is an absolute mess i sat down to watch this provocative disaster about a year ago and it has stuck with me ever since it has lingered for so long because it is representative of everything that could possibly go wrong with a production such as this i am fan of robert rodriguez 's directing i also absolutely love everything that quentin tarantino has cranked out since his inception as a director i grew up with interest in the occasional frank miller graphic novel this is why it is so sad that sin city fails on so many levels within the first 23 minutes of watching this film i was praying that it would be over soon i only stuck it out so i could one day write this review let 's break it down to its most basic levels the film has great directors great actors a great story and a great production design with all of this going for it one expects sin city '' to be a landmark movie experience and it is though for me the experience is a negative one and the attainment it achieves is in the depths of pointless exploitation the film tells three stories with a fourth vignette as a framing device bruce willis battling a monster mickey rourke as an ugly hulk out to avenge a girlfriend 's murder and clive owen as a private eye helping a band of imperiled hookers the three segments transpire more or less in sequence with some confusing overlapping and all take place in sin city a and in every other way caricature of a hollywood world it 's a caricature of a caricature no one would ever confuse this world with reality the heroes shake off multiple gunshot wounds devastating blows to the head and other lethal overtures like slaps on the cheek the hookers all look like victoria 's secret models the scenes are ugly day dreams and to be fair the stylish blend of exoticism and continual chaos generates a certain visual fascination sin city however ca n't sustain it and after the first segment it 's hard to imagine how anyone could find its trashy excess anything but tedious obnoxious and repetitive everything that happens in the movie is an calculated cliche the stories have a minimal narrative drive or interest the banter is banal babble and the performances are as shallow as most snl '' skits these days rodriguez is rather vain because of his pride in the way his movie so faithfully bows to the genius '' of miller and his world with the same kind of religious devotion gus van sant paid to hitchcock with his psycho '' remake is art some special invention that deserves such recognition are n't movies already enough like dumb comic books without actually trying to be one though it 's not immediately obvious sin city '' is a comedy and its aspiration is to pull off the tarantino trick of making its audience wearily laugh at the outrageousness of its sadism at the same time it subtly gets off on it sexually and it 's out to tarantino by basking in the pornography of brutality on a large scale a giddy spectacular in which we sit back like romans at the coliseum watching people being decapitated disemboweled dismembered castrated and humiliated check out fellini 's satyricon if that is what you are really after the publicity has made a big deal about what a risky '' commercial venture this is and how heroic it was for rodriguez to insist on putting miller 's name in the title and above his own in the directing credits but this all stinks of the worst hollywood insincerity for one thing can anyone doubt that such a violent movie with such a lineup of stars will make a ton of money given the distance sin city '' pushes the envelope to on sick movie violence and given the recent massacres such a backlash from the christian right and other voices for movie censorship seems likely and rodriguez may even be hoping for it i do n't support these voices for a minute i do n't believe in censorship and i do n't think movies motivate mass murder but i do think that a film like this especially one made by a major director under the flag of artistic integrity adds something ugly to the air for which critics must hold it accountable sitting through the thing watching scene after scene in which i was being asked to be entertained by the spectacle of helpless people being tortured i kept thinking of all the other horrible acts that are being committed today and how we as an american society are taught to think that it is all so gruesome and atrocious i suppose some people do n't find it that bad sin city '' is their movie
zach braff of scrubs '' fame wrote directed and starred in garden state '' the flick has a lot of good ideas but at its heart there is a sodden dull story that can not be enlivened by copious amounts of wit braff plays large '' a actor now reduced to waiting tables in a vietnamese restaurant he returns home to jersey when his mother dies stirring lots of ugly family history once home large 's emotional becomes evident but is almost matched by the toneless muddle of high school friends he runs into the only spark is sam natalie portman who for some reason falls for this sack of dull platitudes the script is too clever by half invoking hamsters silent velcro an abyss infomercials on real estate and other inanities in an attempt at edginess the movie feels like it was written by a writer cut loose from the sad last year of northern exposure '' couple this with a soundtrack and a wasted crop of actors why ian holm why and you 've got garden state '' here 's hoping braff can get past the quips and into some serious storytelling
this review will be simple garden state is fake manipulative and annoying it tries way too hard and every idiosyncratic '' element seems forced and insincere i hate to offened any reader out there but the entire time i was watching this flick i had one thought '' this is a movie for tools '' you know those tv commercials for cars or cellphones it 's about two hours of that vapid and pretty and insincere the compulsive overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite the director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots well '' than making a decent movie skip this one ! cliched derivative phoney forced if you 're in the mood for something in this 'genre ' just rewatch your wes anderson collection or maybe 'i heart huckabees ' or even 'eternal sunshine '' do n't waste your time on this drivel
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism by female director heckerling ! she duplicated it in chevy chase vehicle national lampoon 's european vacation too ! many child actors got their start here but the thing that cracked me up as i saw it when it came out nately was the dialog of my fav band cheap trick ticket scalper the magntism of robin zander and the charisma of rick nielsen and what about the tunes 'i want you to want me the dream police 'you 're momma 's alright your daddy's alright they just seem a little weird surrender surrender '' before he 's interrupted if that is n't somebody's idea of 'surrender ' they 've stumbled onto this review by mistake
the obvious attitude of the producers of this mess was clearly one of superiority i mean after all we 're shooting in imax instead of the nefarious format ! '' well whoopdeedoo ! i 'll take the bubble metalstorm or amityville any day over this there is some nice computer graphics work here but there 's really no story to speak of and their history of presentation '' is superficial at best while surely impressive in imax encounter looks stupid on your tv screen 'cause everything is covered in a long shot or a medium long shot yes that may work on the giant behemoth imax screen but reduce it in size to your tv even my big jvc and it 's pretty unimpressive not only that but if you 're watching it in with liquid crystal glasses then you 're watching it in half the normal resolution you normally see on your ntsc screen so there 's next to no picture detail if you want a good dvd movie search the web for one of the alternating field dvd 's of something like it came from outer space house of wax or dial m for murder sadly only available in via pirated editions because the us distributors do n't care enough to bother so were only left with legit dvd 's of crap like encounters and amatuer videos of murderous clowns on the rampage i would have given this two stars because it features very briefly cassandra elvira '' peterson but they covered her only in long shot too ! they were really stooopid so they get one star boo
as mentioned in another review stolen scenes from runaway train not just clips but entire scenes also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger still worth 3 4 for a dvd just for the other action
i have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst i could n't believe i wasted 2 hours of my life on it they literally stole scenes from runaway train in this not the ideas they stole the filmed scenes the train kept going from one engine to the four in rt the continuity was a joke had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky rodney eastman was in the movie for about 5 mins but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
con express '' has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action is n't enough and in between stunt pieces and the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a company producing this i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably wo n't mind this one too much just go easy on it
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even '' absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since
i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film
i saw this movie more than once during its theatrical release in the and enjoyed it very much however for some reason when i bought the new dvd and saw it again i found it to be so tedious and embarassingly corny that i turned it off after the first and donated the disk to my library the acting is all annoyingly and james fox in particular is so hyperactive i wanted to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart maybe it was the difference between viewing as a kid and as an adult but this film has really lost its luster
with the exception of a few songs and key lines i found this movie to be extemely disappointing in comparrison to the broadway show in my opinion julie andrews lacked the spunk that millie 's character required and carol channing was just horrible as muzzy ! i do think mary tyler moore was a very good miss dorothy '' and i was impressed by the dancing much more so than the singing if you are wanting to purchase this as a reminder of the broadway musical i would recommend purchasing the cd of the songs from the show instead
i'v seen a multitude of documentaries both low and high budget and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given worth seeing but not worth owning
i was very disappointed and feel that the only dvd worthwhile in this set is high society '' that deserves 5 stars ! the other dvds lack the quality and cole porter song content i would recommend buying high society by itself which ironically was my initial intention
i read some good reviews about this movie in adition i respect french 's cinema they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies so i bought spanish apartment '' a big dissapointment hughe one it 's candid it 's naive '' it 's boring with poor ideas poor acting very predictable there 's a lot of good movies around you do n't waste your time in this one
i rented this thinking it was an audrey tautou flick but it is n't she 's on the cover but she 's only in a few scenes that is n't the real reason why i think that this movie is there really is n't much in this movie that i have n't seen done elsewhere i kept thinking that i 've seen other movies do this or that better then again i 've seen a lot of foreign and independant films so i 've gotten a bit picky at times nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one it 's a mediocre flick i do n't know why it got rave reviews i remember seeing the dvd in a sale bin at a discount store for 5 but i thought it would be a waste because seeing it once was enough and i do n't feel like i 'll ever need to see it again
i ca n't believe they named me after that book it 's so sexist ! '' after amelie where she was a delight as well as at should have passed on this loser ! political correctness is just intolerance by another name ! but you ca n't tell a liberal that ! it 's bad here in usa but i suppose the french must be the worst they have fined bardot for merely expressing her opinions that muslims are barbaric ! talk about intolerant
i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes the episodes davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier the episodes davy crockett 's keelboat race davy crockett and the river pirates were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector 's box the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between 100 whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for 16 i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school they also discover that they have been cheating on one another the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters i would have expected better from these two
several reasons apparently the other online reviewers are extremely in their critiques of this film the dvd 's jacket has a quote from rolling stone '' think 'sex and the city ' with men ! '' well i say think again '' as an avid watcher of sex and the city '' this film has little if any comparison to satc firstly this film is not a comedy there were very small instances when i kind of chuckled but could barely muster a real laugh actually towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that i kept hitting fast forward on the remote those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what i mean here ! the characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person 's life these disjointed glimpses do n't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters yes they are all bored whether they are in their 30 's or their 50 's yes they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs i usually enjoy movies with this type of plot for example pane e tulipani bread and tulips facing windows also starring giovanna mezzogiorno and a much better film under the tuscan sun shirley valentine a month by the lake etc the last kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do however the viewer is left with no warm feelings about life 's decisions only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film
i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004. i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie but it was really lackluster the acting is wooden the script is very lame and worst of all the action is n't very exciting i expected a much better movie from director richard donner there is a battle scene and there are action scenes but they just are n't exciting when the action is n't exciting you better have a good story the story here is alright but certainly not enough to save the movie i do n't hate any of the actors they are decent when they have something to work with here they had nothing to work with so they obviously did n't do too well this time this really is n't worth your time i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there
a thin soup of potty humor fart jokes and juvenile cheap laughs you know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you have n't even cracked a smile good gawd dustin hoffman sitting on the toilet robert deniro breastfeading a baby foreskin dropped into a fondue pot wow a movie that hurt to watch it was n't even worth renting for free from the public library
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro awesome ! hoffman awesome ! streisand awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie these actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film and i recommend it to every and anyone to see but wear your depends because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya 99 you do n't know what in the friggin ' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an loser that complains about going out to the movies stay home i 'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently
like other reviewers i found meetthe parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for 25 bin at hollywood so i figured why not '' well here 's why not it presents the main character 's parents as crude clueless buffoons and having no social judgement whatsoever but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip and for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on fantasy island i 'm surprised they did n't include a sex with a midget scene nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former cia agent who was set up as an object of ridicule oh and they had to be jewish too streisand and hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way our people do n't shoot ducks dear '' do former cia agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built rv that would cost at least 250 k the toilet humor and profanity would n't have made it into dumb and dumber '' nothing reedeming or funny here fuhgeddaboutit
i really like wesley snipes and i really like action movies this movie disappointed on both accounts i had to wonder what snipes was thinking in doing this film i still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters so why do a movie truthfully i did n't even read the cover before renting it because it was wesley snipes but even if i did i would have still rented it the movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase after that the movie seems to fizzle out there is not much dialogue and i think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film the acting is pretty bad all around although i think snipes did what he could with what he as given the directing is frazzled and just plain weird i did n't like it much at all i think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse given the right attention this movie could have been great but i get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could it has potential but in my opinion everyone involved in it just fell flat i had trouble getting through the whole thing if you are a die hard snipes fan then you might want to rent it but i do n't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not it just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious i have ever seen do n't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you 've wasted your time watching it only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are
maybe he needed the dough whatever it is this movie along with the other one he made the marksman are pretty bad 90 minute 7 seconds was a little better but whoa the stench rotted my entertainment center for days sorry wesley for what it 's worth your not a bad actor but your agent is selling you off to the lowest bidder good
this truly is a horrible movie 7 seconds huh yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it the acting is horrible the plot is horrible the filming is horrible everything is horrible ! i was hopeful because of snipes which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie ! snipes could n't even do the fight scenes and make them look real the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love ! huh they were a romantic interest they hinted at it but never showed this happening do not rent or buy this movie stay away or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie
7 seconds is a formulaic capper that 's not entertaining at all the car chases are ok but nothing to write home about it 's a regular snipes movie but lacking fun it 's long illogical which isnt bad if it 's entertaining and just plain boring
seven seconds is about how long you want to watch this piece of garbage ! no wonder i 've never heard of this movie it 's a disaster ! almost every movie i 've seen wesley snipes in is good so i figured i was going to see a decent movie when i rented this wrong ! it 's very hard to understand exactly what 's going on in this movie it was dragged out and just plain ridiculous ! every review on amazon for this movie so far is bad we ca n't all be wrong
it is a bit strange to watch all this fight against dan brown 's book what is for millions people who like the da vinci code book usually do not take it as a source of historical facts the value of this book is not in the particular facts but in general and serious idea about danger of destroying balance in society indeed a human being consists of two parts males and females have very different views on this world so that these views should be well balanced if one of the parts becomes heavily predominating it may be truly dangerous for survival of our species dan brown just takes our attention to the problem he shows that the imbalance has a long history and it might be a major source of many current problems in human society as well as the source of overall instability on the earth and the latter is not fiction
fortunately i obtained this dvd from the library didnt have to pay for it very one sided almost completely avoids discussing both sides recomnmend instead da vinci codde decoded jesus mary da vinci or unlociking da vinci 's code check amazon reviews rating on these other dvds
i was extremely disappointed with this title in the sense that it is a one way only answer they do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions they also seem to point to brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book i am an person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities this dvd made me feel like a fool to do so on the other hand if you do n't beleive anything in the book then this dvd is for you it might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home the bible how convenient ! hope this helps
and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake the narritor 's voice was monotone i wanted to shout at his pompous snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples with the narritor granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko when you take people on a educating journey such as nine hours long invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying check please ''
i saw this movie yesterday thinking it 'd be exciting i sure am glad that i survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie there 's no story line the acting is pathetic whoever gave vin diesel the idea that he can act like an earlier reviewer observes it 's about who 's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review
absolutely unwatchable so silly it 's very nearly offensive it 's like watching one long music video by a rapper full of dumb beautiful women buff ghetto thugs and jokey cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the script is laughable the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber '' than butch cassidy and the sundance kid '' awful
i would rate this piece of film trash a 0 '' but unfortunately that is not an available option this stupid movie did not start the scene but it did contribute to it this review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler that somehow you have transformed yourselves into mario andretti and a ferrari i have some astounding news for you the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus no one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways in fact everytime i read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills i actually celebrate with my friends and we relieve ourselves on the grave because there is one less stupid person on the road do the rest of the world a favor save your money do n't make your car look stupid and ghetto which in return makes you look stupid and ghetto learn how to drive safely turn your hat around facing forward pick up your retarded looking baggy pants put a belt on and hide your underwear that no one wants to see but laughs at you while you walk past and speak a normal language that includes words besides dawg '' and other neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity
i ca n't give it any less than one star but what the heck the girls were hot so there 's the one star other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie ! i swear to god ! i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe ! they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job ! even if they just ran around the set yelling potato salad march ! '' the dialogue would have been 1000 times better message to the producer give it up loser ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
maybe i loved the original one too much but this version of the story did not work for me i especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas stick with the first one it was perfect
i loved the original movie and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be wrong wrong ! ! first of all the child actors were horrible well the charlie and mike characters were ok but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder
this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it 's the michael look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe what does that mean '' when are screenwriters going to figure it out either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton if you are not a fan of either do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern 's classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp 's performance '' is chock full of ticks and mannerisms flat and finally rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton 's film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton 's part that does n't make the final product any more watchable it 's one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton 's other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with could care less about the final result is a film that 's like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio
and canada only '' so no need to market it to me in europe
okay people robert redford is an atrocious actor he is a hormel hamslice prancing around as a vapid pooh bah witness the scene in this film when he is tired '' and answers the phone ha ! okay but on to the movie the candidate is apparently for those legions of people out there in america who think they 're good enough they 're strong ehough and gosh darnit they want to make a difference ! oh but politics is so evil ! well i would never want a politician like this wimpus calling the shots for me or my family this film squanders what could have been an insightful look at political ambition instead is as always doofus 1. it helps that the evil republican is nothing more than a windbag spouting off empty rhetoric hint to filmakers movies are more dynamic when there 's an interesting villian but as a political junkie there still was enough here to keep me mildly interested if only because it 's a great portrait of the vapidity of the left however this film fails not because of any political predisposition for it does n't even begin to explore the origins of political power
cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
after taking my dog to a true dog behaviorist he told me that cesar 's style '' is something i should not adopt his one size fits all got ta show 'em who 's boss '' mantra is completely my dog behaviorist is renowned in this part of the country and gives seminars on dog behavior in japan as well he also heads the training for dogs who are taken into our local hospitals i trust him completely so i definitely question now what cesar the dog whisperer '' has to offer the person i am working with operates solely on the reward '' system
the books are witty and charming this in stark contrast is formulaic schlock americans and much of the world 's consumers prefer their entertainment predigested so it does n't require chewing so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly in the land of limitless equality everything is reduced to equal tastelessness if you want impart the capacity for discernment to your child you could start by avoiding this twaddle the eloise books are special while this movie is mere product
this film is based on a concept that has potential a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things but it does n't deliver clearly the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us but he pretty much drops the ball right there usually with this sort of plot you are at least given the illusion that knows the answer and what 's more has some clue about what to do with it as well there 's no such suspension of disbelief in this one nor even an attempt at such adding injury if you count eye strain to insult the whole thing is shot in grainy b w with annoying jump cuts in the awards for obnoxious splash films of the year this one takes the cake but not the pi
when a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience white and jittery gray the result had better be good that fraction of members of the general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money push play alongside and strain to see if it works thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically that of color the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that despite some grand intention do not work or in the alternative do not work as well citing two examples sin city which is acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white tantamount to robbery and good night america which is all and about the same the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one 's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one 's point one might be better served as a charcoal artist color is the medium of life from a budgetary perspective black and white films save money as the 'challenges ' of color which in a good feature can be excessive are thus eliminated yet complications arise for instance i was n't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy 's hand similarly the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink in shades of course and we would never know yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie or is it one wonders however that if pi production would have had more money would they have opted for color moot point it 's done notwithstanding the obvious that i do n't prefer black and white movies and incidentally do n't know lots of people who do pi although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work clever symbolism and guts seems to lanquish for other reasons despite pi 's visceral intensity which is delibertaely throughout spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves after max 's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost as as result the movie stays earthbound weighted down by a mediocre plotline obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there failing repetitive effect and thin uninspiring support cast leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle was n't won the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine airborne one second belly down the next as a fine creative exercise the creators are praised for their effort and bravery pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging traffic and commands the watcher 's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced a beautiful mind ''
this movie is no heathers '' it 's not even mean girls '' as hard as it tried to be witty shocking dark and satirical it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i 'm just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless '' and the craft '' until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push i just did n't get it the movie was n't funny which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses carol kane could n't even elicit a smile out of me the plot was full of holes and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers but i was at least hoping for 1 hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately the entertainment '' piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless
boy this movie was weird and psycho i happen to like the weird movies but it was way off the psycho side for me friends try to cover up an accidental death '' from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong things like this i try to stay away from although i am glad i saw it so i wo n't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not now i know i gave it 2 stars because the movie did have it 's charms
books have been written and will continue to be written to try and disprove christianity and jesus as the son of god what is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people that 's because you ca n't disprove the truth and what are some of the errors you ask i will give you a few dan brown tries to use gnostic gospels gospels written in the century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses to try and prove his theory and omitting new testament scripture to say that jesus and mary magdalene were married by using the gospel of phillip written after 250 where there are missing words and the companion of the mary magdalene more than the disciples kiss her on her clearly there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after jesus died this does not prove anything also he says that the word companion '' means spouse in aramaic which is great except that the gospel of philip was written in coptic '' where companion '' does not mean spouse ! '' second dan brown says that it was n't until 325 ad at the council of nicea did people start to believe jesus was a deity and that it was a close vote new testament disproves that because it shows that jesus was deity where paul writes in 1 corinthians for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen by cephas then by the twelve '' also the council of nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders all of whom believed that jesus was divine the main question was whether jesus was begotten or made jesus ' divinity death and resurrection were not in question only two of 318 clerics at the council did not sign the nicene creed so there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close ! third his main argument is that it mary magdalene in the last supper painting by leo if that were true then where is john the youngest and most beloved apostle john was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth as is seen in many stained glass portraits in european cathedrals and also leo was just a painter who was not around when jesus was so it did n't matter if he tried to put mary in a painting or not ! fourth brown says that the gnostic gospels and the dead sea scrolls are the earliest christian records '' while the new testament obviously came before the gnostic gospels the dead sea scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in hebrew greek and aramaic that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of jesus or of any other person mentioned in the new testament as they are jewish documents ! he also says they were discovered in the 1950 's when they were discovered in 1947. oops ! fifth dan brown says that christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of mithraism he says that mithraism worshipped the god mithras called the son of god and light of the world who was born on december died was buried in a rock tomb and then resurrected in three days scholars of mithraism would strongly disagree with brown on all of these points nowhere is mithras given the title son of god and the light of the world brown apparently made this up because it sounded good mithras was born on december however this proves nothing the new testament never associated december with the birth of christ the early christians chose to celebrate the birth of christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan festival of saturnalia they never claimed jesus was actually born on that date the claim that mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true scholars will tell you that in mithraism there is no death of mithras at all so there was no rock tomb and no resurrection so once again he is nowhere near correct lastly brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels first there were only less than half that many books written about jesus life the two gnostic gospels brown relies on most heavily were n't written until the second century long after the new testament gospels were written it makes sense that the gnostic gospels came about in the late second century as this is when gnostic thought was most prevalent however the new testament was complete before the end of the century also the gospel of thomas which dan brown lies heavily on claims women must become men in order to receive salvation that makes no sense there are many other errors in this novel but i think i have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously this is pure or rather poor '' fiction without a shred of evidence that jesus was anything other than the christ the son of the living god ! thank you dan brown for making my faith stronger
when i purchased this dvd i was hoping to get the complete an unbiased presentation from scratch i could sense what was to come bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this dvd it is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted what little was discussed appeared to be very tainted i definitely did not expect national geographic to come up with this kind of a dvd i will definitely think ten times before i purchase anything from them maybe they should just stick to and leave alone
the content of the dvd national geographic is it real da vinci 's code '' appears to be very badly researched assumptions made by national geographic are presented to the viewer as facts conclusions drawn are in general not supported with plausible evidence the views projected are bias and i would n't be surprised if the catholic church was the main sponsor of this movie all in all a highly disappointing dvd
i had high hopes for requiem of darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it also the characters looked very unique and intriguing unfortunatley the beginning is very rough both in content and speed of the show the plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories he is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head he meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy unfortunately the show is not as slick as the plot sounds the first episode immediately starts off with the it is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous throughout the episode you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises the problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who 's who the second episode i found more enjoyable since it was unique it is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman the willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children it even has a little plot twist nothing extrodinary but still welcoming and once again the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders this is when the show became boring for me i do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about but i like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about also the show 's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the dvd i give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great unfortunately the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show were n't the main focus of these first few episodes maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot but i personally do n't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk one last note this show has very intense adult content do n't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not actually i personally thought the rating was too low for this show
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here crash '' comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world '' my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here 's a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i do n't like any of these people so their pain does n't mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would 've worked but now there just is n't anything there as far as what 's actually in the movie we 've got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we 've got jared 's mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto 's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there 's no real attempt to make wayans into a person he 's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that 's it the doubly sad fact is that he 's the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it 's a wonder that the smack does n't cause them to cease to exist entirely well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually the bergman films i 've seen so that 's not really a fair comparison they love each other apparently but since i do n't even like either of them i 'm not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it would n't have been funny if i cared about her but we 've been over that and i want you people to know that i 'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie 's dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting '' which has characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba '' a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream '' so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that 's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream '' is n't helped any by darren aronofsky 's repetitive derivative the trouble is this movie has n't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they 're hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see a thousand times montages a million times and plenty of wonky junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai n't drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that does n't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky was n't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters were n't going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that 's a good ending grade ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows
i give this film one star for the acting which is often very good however the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness and debase every aspect of lower income urban people in all honesty i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film against my better judgement still if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty then i recommend a streetcar named desire '' kids '' last exit to brooklyn '' and traffic ''
though i 'm still a big south park fan i do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons this season has its standouts most notably the truly demented christmas critters episode but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes to make matters worse matt and trey put next to no effort into providing any extras for fans who pony up top dollar for the dvd collections a show like the simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans full episode commentaries with writers producers directors voice actors etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features matt and trey provide generally uninteresting mini commentaries '' no doubt about it the boys are just generally phoning it in '' at this point seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible
sorry but this video is not for the average dog owner ! if you identify with the punk rock scene and are looking for an alternative to the standard dog training video then this might work for you this video shows basic training techniques but the narrator 's voice over '' distracts from the actual training process going on the korny and n't skits attempt to show the viewer correct training techniques and obvious training mistakes but are a waste of worth 8 but definitely not the 22.95 price tag i would return it if not for amazon 's return policy against returning opened videos
i hear this is a good movie but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged so what about quality control this disc should never have gotten out the door but the odd thing is i ordered 2 dvd 's from amazon different titles both damaged are you guys buying and pawning them off on us f
when i saw the cast of this film i hired it it was n't bad but i ca n't say that i was overwhelmed with enthusiasm it was a bit slow although the surprising twist at the end makes you think how you make emotive assumptions based on the facts which are often quite erroneous i wo n't say more so as not to spoil it for you but it was n't up to my expectations
i am normally a fan of keanu reeves marissa tomei and particularly james spader but not in this movie first whoever cast marissa as a psychiatrist needs some medical attention of their own she just does n't look or even try to act the part she 's lucky that academy awards for cousin vinny ca n't be recalled keanu tries to creep us out as a good looking serial killer with excessively polite diction what an original concept ! ! ! but comes off as a stepford husband '' robotic and really not that scary let 's just say that he wo n't be replacing anthony hopkins or tony perkins anytime soon james spader who is usually the personification of arrogant indifference just does n't come across sometimes he 's arrogant too often he is indifferent then so are we because his dialog and character are so poorly conceived i blame virtually all of this on a lousy screenplay and amateurish direction there is not one original thought shot or concept in the entire movie the trick '' camera shots look like the work of a stoned high school kid and the background music is so wretched and disconnected from the story that you begin to wonder if your dvd player may not be picking up random radio signals from a foreign country all in all this would barely rank as a good made for tv '' movie it lacks the power talent vision and skill of a legitimate theatrical release for these reasons i am advising you to pass it up can definitely do better
i 've always believed that keanu reeves would make a really good bad guy ever since i saw him in action in the gift i was hoping that the watcher would provide the answer netflix to the rescue ! the plot of the watcher revolves around joel campbell james spader a former fbi agent who has moved from to chicago to escape his demons and his demons are many including an affair with a married woman the death of said married woman and the choice joel had to make between catching a serial killer david allen giffin played by reeves or letting the woman he loves burn to death unfortunately joel was too late to save her joel moves to escape his past but his past moves with him david decides to relocate his serial killing activities to chicago and continue their game of he 's gotten so used to killing that joel is now a part of the thrill of the hunt so david invents a little game he mails a picture of his next victim to joel who has until 9 that day to find her before it 's too late in the middle of all this is polly beilman the lovely marisa tomei joel 's psychiatrist she tries to help joel deal with his issues he never really sleeps and has perpetual migraines can you guess why she 's in this film kids i knew you could ! there are two powerful flaws that make the film distracting instead of creepy problem 1 the film alternates between several point of view '' speeds one of them is the normal film of life the second is stalker cam from the perspective of david who watches his victims just to mix things up occasionally the screens flashes bright white and we hear the sound of a camera flash david 's watching get it the third and worst film speed is the memory cam we see bits and pieces of joel 's past life and the death of his lover in weird six million dollar man slow motion blur it 's annoying the first time and becomes extremely tedious as the film revisits the same scene over and over and over worse this effect is used whenever action takes place on screen it 's almost as if the director did n't know what to do during action scenes and resorted to blurring things a lot to cover it all up problem 2 at bizarre inappropriate times we get rock music interludes the music varies so widely in scope that it never establishes a mood american psycho used music to excellent effect covering up the screams of the victims as well as establishing the decade of the movie in the watcher it 's like someone flipped to mtv during the boring parts the main thrust of the film is the horrible anonymity that we all suffer in cities even though joel knows who 's going to die even though the police put posters of the victim everywhere even though the tv news broadcasts who the victim is nobody notices these poor lonely girls it 's a compelling message that 's utterly lost in this film the actors work with what they 've got spader comes off as patently unlikable tomei looks bored everyone else is there to act as typical foils reeves ' dialogue makes him sound and act like an idiot and that 's the problem serial killers are human wrecks built from abuse and neglect we never learn more about david and why he does what he does to make him truly frightening we need to get inside his head stalker cams do n't count but half the time the watcher is about joel who comes off as kind of a jerk heck david 's kills are n't even scary the trailer showed david 's shadow as he strangled a woman with piano wire but get this it was sped up in other words the guys making the trailer decided the murder scenes in the watcher were too boring so they sped it up for the trailer that one scene was what made me want to see the movie but in the actual film that scene is filmed in slow motion flash forget joel 's migraines the watcher tries to give you a migraine this is joe charbanic 's first film as a director and presumably his last since imdb does n't list anything else since 2000 when the watcher was made it shows
the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this bad movie
musicals are historically slight in the plot department and this movie is no exception three stars one fading one rising and one coasting do not help matters either rita is the fading star it was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow the make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes and her hair and costumes are just bad novak is the rising star although i do n't get the 50 's obsession with bubble headed busty bleach blond bimbos it would help if she could act but sadly her range is very limited i truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic since she was unable to convey it herself then there is frank just coasting on his charm and cool does n't seem plausible that a hep cat like him who could bag any doll '' dame '' or mouse would fall for either of these gals anyway i gave it 2 stars because of snuffy the dog he stole every scene he was in although that was n't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie
this movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them for a theater lover this is heartbreaking what a disappointing story if a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a adulterer even the ending was changed and not for the better the dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing a pretty face is not enough
if you loved the back to the future trilogy and generally speaking time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen simply forget about buying this dvd all being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie while you try to figure out all the science '' you 've been taught so far then space you out close to the end leaving you totally speechless this is not good simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real pros while winding up with some abrubt nonsense end of the movie with absolutely no logic at all they simply had to eventually stop shooting so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot not a movie and not a romantic story either look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie
i usually trust amazon reviewers on movie reviews but this time way ! this silly totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment hoping the movie would liven up sadly it did n't to those who rave about the film you must be in another dimension or something thumbs down
i gave the guy a chance i saw his stand up and some of his skits recently i saw him on that pompous show inside the actor 's studio '' they showed some of his classic '' bits throughout it all not one laugh shook my tummy the racist sexual and political material he makes fun of is more easily and hilariously skewered on mad tv just because a black man screams the n '' word a bunch of times it does not make him a brilliant comedian the most annoying thing about chappelle is his willingness to don the mantle of suffering artist '' for a while he was avoiding comedy central 's offer to renew his contract by supposedly hiding out in a mental ward false modesty aside he clearly enjoys his own hype chappelle should change his name to chapeux and sell hats
i do n't think this guys jokes are funny at all every skit is a slithering crack at white people and most of his shows are very violent and strange i think this guy has a searing hatred of whites also all that very serious stuff aside and when he is n't being like that which is almost never he just is n't particularly very funny and his skits look cheap and thrown together basically his shows seems immature uneducated and lacking in true social awareness but this is for you if you like fart joke '' level humor with an seriously hateful black twist
i liked the shows when the ran on tv the unrated did n't quite live up to my expectations
i just finished watching das boot to even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous where das boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war is just more hollywood tripe if you just want 'splosions and escapism i guess does the trick if you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come go with das boot
another product of hollywood 's karaoke culture '' in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in '' an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot '' but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors and absurd scenarios an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit put this ridiculous movie in its own category is just another thin movie you 'll forget the day after you see it
sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful
i thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like kevin kline meryl streep and lily tomlin etc instead the movie was extremely slow boring and drawn out ! ! it was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie i could n't stand watching another second of it so i stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store i rented it from if the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty then perhaps it would have been good
based on the ratings i suspect kindhearted people think they should praise this film because of the likeability of its stars but from the heavyhanded appearance of death '' to the acting styles to the endless songs you deserve a medal if you do n't ever hit fast forward this simply does not even approach the charm wit and easy musicality of the prairie home companion radio show also the dvd transfer seems a bit dark
sure this movie is a classic but is it any good frankly i found it to be tedious in the extreme it 's certainly pleasant to look at the sets are quite amazing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story as described in detail in many other reviews here has potential as both a thriller and a essay ultimately it is neither the acting is top notch as are all of the special effects those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory in fact all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic but the whole thing never rises to its premise its thriller '' aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed the only key that can stop the nuke ! the resolution is an afterthought a quick fix in the extreme and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is narrowly whew ! averted the characters are thin at best and stock at worst this movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early thought technology would be like in the mid yawn i must laugh at the whole bit it means nothing to the plot and is the ultimate contrivance if a deadly virus actually came back from space there would certainly be action on many fronts with plenty of interesting conflict to go around some people would try to understand it others would want only to kill it there 's some potentially interesting tension right there some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public others would want to warn them again that could have been a good source of tension someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon mentioned in passing but never developed while others would try very hard to prevent that more tension i 'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly scenes which it actually contains this movie is the poster child for boring science fiction and it would not have had to be that way i have n't read the book but i bet it 's a lot better at its core this movie is a boring dud
i recently bought this dvd and was really looking forward to seeing it halfway i stopped watching it disappointing
i was a bit disappointed in this tape the workouts are too easy i had mastered abs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel 2. i could n't find it so i bought this one but its too easy i found a used abs of steel 2 and i like it much better
this item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me i love tamilee and her arms and abs video from a few years ago that 's why i was excited to see what i thought was a newer production of arms and abs workouts the cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description so i thought the dvd contained all new workouts the 3 arms and abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video so did me no good i did n't buy the dvd for the lower body workouts but viewed them just to see what they were two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the dvd menu meaning you select workout 2 for example and the dvd takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1 ! because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for than dvds since you do n't have to remember which workout you are on you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day this dvd is just a for the tape i already use
although the video was easy to follow there was no variation between the segments the 10 minute segments were basically the same i was looking for a quick video that i can do in the morning but it seemed that i spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves if you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you
this video is broken into six sections who in their right mind would work out for only 10 minutes this is not going to accomplish anything well you think i 'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other this is silly too because each 10 minute segment includes a warmup small workout routine and stretches unless it is okay with you to do all this over and over again it is not an effective use of your time especially if you are truly trying to accomplish a goal
not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which groups been touting for years if you 're thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship do n't the lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end if you 're interested in finding out what i 'm talking about lisa duggan explains how this ideology gets transimitted and reinforced in her book sapphic slashers also if you 're interested in watching a film about lesbian love please do yourself a favor and check out the incredible true story of two girls in love or but i 'm a cheerleader support movies that actually advance queer causes instead of making all of us look like freaks
the shows themselves are wonderful but the people who put together this dvd set should be ashamed of this paltry effort ! there are no cast or staff interviews about the ending of such a wonderful series no commentaries no english no john spencer honorarium of any kind they did n't even take the time to include the 1 hour of the original pilot they aired before the finale ! the only extras '' are two special features dealing with the debate this dvd set is definately not worth the money to buy it brand new
my favorite series ever but that 's been covered elsewhere i love owning the complete set seasons 1 through 7 however the show is n't a miracle cure for the hard of hearing i suppose the extra 5 cents per unit to add english subtitles put y'all over budget top it must be nice to have a captive audience you should only have the opportunity to learn the lesson of last tuesday ! !
the west wing is my favorite television show of all time period nothing else comes even close i could go on and on about the show but others are doing an excellent job on that score and that 's not my point here my point is the awful awful dvd no subtitles for the second year in a row only two special features both about the debate episode no insight from the actors about their take on seven years of television no tribute to john spencer i feel as if the folks at warner brothers television knew they had their market well in hand so the quality of the product really did n't matter no bother we 'll sell enough anyway '' i 'm one of those that bought it anyway but i feel as if i got ripped off
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant it was n't a bad '' movie it simply was n't a good '' one boooooooring
unfortunately this ms collection is not compatible with european dvd players the cover of the dvd actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the us and canada ' save yourself a lot of trouble and do n't buy this if you are from the eu !
the line up of 60 's and 70 's soulsters is interesting an eclectic mixture of the well known and the not so famous the backing orchestration and vocals are excellent however everything unravels when the lead vocals commence the singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made it is not just a matter of 60 year old vocal chords being weaker than 20 year old it is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music the simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume i can understand such a problem with a 1960 concert this is a 2003 production ! i am perplexed
this is a competent fun dvd however it focuses mostly on choreography at the expense of sweat let 's put it this way i 'm a exerciser but i 'm also fat and i barely breathed hard it 's a fun workout if you just want to get your off the couch and do something for a half hour but not so great for a serious cardio workout
this video is all hype and delivers nothing i love dancing dancing in this video is horrible for the latin section there was hardly anything latin about it ! it was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them ick ! not too mention it 's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added i love latin dancing and did n't enjoy this at all the other dancing sections were equally cheesy they were soo cheesy i just felt like an idiot doing them if you are not at a stage in life where you still go to out then you might enjoy this if you do currently go out dancing it 's just going to be torture as for the workout very and lots of lulls as another reviewer said definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing because this is horrible or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up i would n't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy i think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem ! do n't waste your money there are lots of better vids out there this is awful
the only real crime surrounding this film was the murder of chandler 's story this is just another example of someone capitalizing on someone else 's reputation to sell a film gould is about as much marlowe as pee wee herman is mike hammer there is no resemblence additionally the cinematography is terrible it looks like a cheap 70 's movie shot in video instead of film there 's absolutely no suspense nor snappy delivery of lines by gould i can only imagine that anyone who liked this movie probably cared more about marlowe 's neighbors than anything else because there 's almost nothing of redeeming value in this movie for those fans of real noir detective pulp do n't waste your money or time watching this junk you 'll be disappointed
sorry this movie just did n't work tried to watch it twice and just could n't get through the whole thing was it supposed to be a thriller a murder mystery a comedy a drama what do n't waste your time if there are any other philip marlowe films out there try them instead nothing could be as bad and weak as this film the only thing i liked about it was the cat which i am not sure was ever fed ! !
it starts out well but through it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis avoidable
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
let 's be up straight and honest there is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994 balkan runner has a stiff and pondering script full of holes like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix 's claws a talentless cast and a score reminiscent of a cartoon series daisy white is certainly lovely as is isabel russinova but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about balkan runner is one of those movies you 've never heard about and rightly so ! !
here are some interesting facts relating to heat '' and myself length of film 547 minutes number of characters in film 231 number of interesting occurrences 0 number of minutes i was by this film 0 number of times i 've started watching this film then stopped truth be told i 've never actually watched heat '' in its entirety i 've seen almost all of it and many parts of it multiple times but never all the way through in fact i think i probably have seen absolutely all of it considering how many scenes i distinctly recall seeing repeatedly but i ca n't be sure anyway i 'll be sitting there trying to watch it and i just ca n't do it it 's so damn boring and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and i have to do something else like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours maybe just stare at the walls and think mow the lawn perhaps do some dishes clip my toe nails anything i hasten to add however that its extreme length is n't really heat '' s problem it 's all boring cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring just not for as long which would make it about twice as good actually but we 're talking about such a small baseline that the difference would n't be terribly perceptible and it 's not like this thing is n't up my alley people i trust and who have good taste tell me it 's good and i like it has a generally excellent cast but then i 'll be looking at the screen and not one thing not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it and so i stop i 'd like to be more specific but it 's pretty damn hard to say why a film is n't involving it 's tough to describe a lack probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it does n't really have time to get into anything i especially like how pacino 's stepdaughter tries to off herself yet we 've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes why would i care pacino 's marriage is failing you say why would i care pacino and de niro have tedious conversations with one another oh boy it 's also hurt by their making pacino a cop he does n't much work as a good guy furthermore the action scenes are dull as hell also one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin for other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made particularly the ones that suck this observation by the way comes from the film adaptation '' and though it did n't specifically refer to heat '' it totally applies on a related note the 3 '' would be about 1000 times more entertaining than heat '' were someone to make it if you do n't know what i 'm talking about be sure to check out adaptation '' it 's a good example of a film that is n't really sucky and boring unlike some things i dislike i feel no animosity towards those who think heat '' is great though i ca n't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie and so they got one at least in their heads it 's got pacino and de niro together ! it 's so damned long complicated and humorless ! it superficially resembles great films from the past ! 4 stars ! ! i realize that this is unfair of me and i hate it when other people try and explain the hidden false meanings why i like whatever movie they do n't like but it 's what i think and if that makes me a hypocrite which it does well i ca n't change that and besides it 's always possible that i 'm right if in 20 years heat '' is largely forgotten we can assume that i 'm correct if not i 'll watch it again this time all the way through and we 'll see if i 've changed my mind and we 'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if i 'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one get back to me in 2026. perhaps we 'll have to make it 2031 cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy i need some more breathing room but til then the hell with heat '' i 'll just watch taxi driver '' or the godfather '' or goodfellas '' or the departed '' or whatever again just about anything will do actually regardless of quality or genre as long as it 's shorter than heat ''
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
i have always like denise austin however this was tape was way too fast for a beginner i thought it was for beginner and on up denise went way to fast and she did not explain the poses at all i will not be using this tape i was disappointed because normally i love her videotapes and her
we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch can anyone say buzz and woody chicken run the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story 2. how many times can you do the joke worse still is the dialogue the painfully unfunny and the animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another and that once again we see a lack of locations or interest there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest this film is a piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry
i hated this movie so unrealistic sure maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating but i am a teenager in a city nobody acts like this ! what the hell is the point of this movie to scare the crap out of parents also the rape scene was vile at first i respected the director for showing it and not shying away a full minute later i started feeling awkward and uncomfortable it was n't even artistic it was just disgusting and truly disturbing
people who claim they loved '' this gratuitous violence and movie need to get a life and learn what a great movie is there is nothing redeeming or important '' about this movie it 's just ugly
few leftist icons are looked upon more favorably than professor and activist howard zinn like many radical ideologues he is the darling of students the professorate and the glitterati indeed hollywood star matt damon provided the narration for a hagiographic documentary about his life entitled howard zinn ca n't be neutral on a moving train you ca n't be neutral '' is a reference to zinn 's belief that all history is skewed by the mind that conveys it and that the best historians must be engaged '' in political and societal matters therefore it is when their discussion of events always manages to be harmonious with their worldview such a outlook is quite popular today but prevalence is not always an indication of value zinn informs viewers that no work is ever completely objective which then allows him and other activists to avoid using research and citations which do not substantiate their suppositions that no historical account is ever 100 percent objective can not be doubted but an automaton 's level of clinical impartiality is neither possible nor expected one commits a fallacy by pretending that it is as nothing can ever be 100 percent objective or subjective good history doggedly attempts to be unbiased when it abandons its detachment any amount of distortion becomes acceptable history gets alchemized into propaganda zinn minimizes his own lack of scholarship in the peoples ' history of the united states by claiming that it was not written with an academic audience in mind as a man zinn appears to be more celebrity than egghead he is n't one to quibble over the nature of secondary or primary source materials he 'd rather illustrate his points by quoting lyrics from a woody guthrie song no doubt that the directors of this film ascribe to their subject 's view of fairness as not one of the individuals interviewed uttered a single negative syllable about zinn uniformly leftist luminaries like noam chomsky alice walker marian wright edelman daniel ellsberg and tom hayden spent their segments exalting the importance of his impact upon society their depiction of zinn 's personality was most revealing and in keeping with the tendencies of leftists in general according to his friends and associates he possesses a steely anger '' and an endless capacity for moral outrage '' which is representative of the whole john ray 's key psychological components of the leftist are discernible in zinn as his need for fame praise power and attention are quite pronounced at one point zinn 's perceptions appear utterly astonishing as a jew in the air force who was sent to fight the nazis during world war ii he found himself in a position of what should have been absolute moral clarity if ever a person was placed into a position where war was morally just this was it however his reminiscences are confined to indignation over his unit 's bombing an enclave of german soldiers he lamented the action as the men in the french village were n't doing anything to anybody '' except defending the boundaries of a genocide state perhaps the best way to sum up howard zinn is through words he applied to uncle sam limited opinionated and with special interests ''
margarett mitchell must be rolling in her grave she wrote a masterpiece in the 1930 's then alexandra ripley bought the rights to her book by conning margaret mitchell 's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative alexandra ripley 's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush even worse than a barbara courtland romance novel beautiful costumes and a good cast but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche 's the tv movie version is even worse than alexandra ripley 's book i would have given this movie zero stars but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of sean bean as the deliciously evil lord fenton sean bean heats up the screen as a sexy feral villian along the lines of the man you love to hate '' as an unsafe sex symbol unless you are a sean bean fan there is nothing worthwhile about this film the script is trite cliche 'd and very slow moving sean bean is only in disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there disc 2 is overwrought with very boring drawn out courtroom scenes i was almost rooting that scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie ! i 've always liked joanna and timothy dalton they are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie 's performance as belle watling is so bad i wanted to slap her do yourself a favor and watch the original gone with the wind starring clark gable and vivien leigh if you want to see a wonderful film
as a made for tv movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a saturday afternoon that you watch because you do n't feel like changing the channel it was okay as the sequel to gwtw or the screen adaptation of the book i enjoyed reading so much it was appallingly awful the acting was weak and the woman that played scarlett was mildly attractive at best it was a complete waist of time and money
i 've loved this movie ever since i saw it on cbs years ago so i was really excited to own it on dvd unfortunately the experience was ruined when i discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene i was very dissapointed the movie is great but the sound problems are n't worth the purchase stay away

i have hope that someday wes craven will return to greatness that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like scream 2 cursed and dracula 2000. i have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like a nightmare on elm street '' or the last house on the left '' but alas red eye '' fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies first of all the flick is which means no blood no sex and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot a pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes i must admit there are directors that can pull off a horror flick but wes craven is not one of the chosen few as soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head yeah it 's that predictable the main character lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight creative title huh to visit daddy immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line and he is obviously more than a destination point while on the phone with pops lisa puts him on hold to speak with cynthia a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip cynthia has to somehow be a victim next lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane he is obviously the bad guy not just because of the random circumstances but he has those bad guy eyes the movie is over from my point of view besides a few inconsistencies the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if lisa and cynthia do n't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel now we all know that this wo n't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings that is why seven was a splendid film by the way the villain was triumphant the guy that sits next lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie it 's all expected and it 's all dribble which may be why they made the movie no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it this movie could have been saved if the villain had a better plan if he was more convincing if the protagonist would n't be so heroic if her morals would n't be so goody two shoes if the movie was n't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable
the premise lisa reisert rachel mcadams is travelling home on the last flight of the night the red eye to miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother jackson rippner cillian murphy is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is rippner 's reason for travel is strictly business it so happens an assassination is planned on the secretary of homeland security while he stays at lisa 's hotel rippner needs lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the secretary to stay in a different room if she does n't comply he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him thoughts this was one of my few experiences with wes craven 's director work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films i despise i had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought and when i finally saw it last night i knew next to nothing of what it was about from what i vaguely remembered of the previews and given craven 's reputation i was honestly expecting rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire in hindsite i think 'vampire on a plane ' woulda been a much better foundation for a film to call this film 's premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair it 's unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller the problem with this film is how it executes those points a hotel manager the secretary of homeland security give me a break ! make it the deputy director of the fbi and the president of the united states and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo the concept of this film has potential but how it was staged is just too ridiculous are we really to believe that the secretary of homeland security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place are we really to believe that the only way this assassination which involves missles did i tell you i wo n't say anymore can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the secretary to stay in a different room and who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed and why the premise is n't only shaky it 's totally gutless it sickens me that hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people situations or beliefs it forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great jack ryan thrillers by tom clancy the sum of all fears in that film instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by isreal which truly is something to fear they decided to go with nazi 's heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are i digress my point is simply that red eye does n't even go that far it has no voice it does n't tell us anything and worse it 's too spineless to put a face on fear there are some good things about the film first and foremost is the cast while rachel mcadams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious miami hotel that part of her character is more of sidenote and it 's a fault of casting more than her acting anyway cillian murphy is very talented and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next i still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though finally we have the legendary brian better than anthony hopkins as hannible lector '' cox he 's such a great actor but in this film he 's relegated to the most menial of roles almost every scene he 's in is him answering the phone being woken up by the phone or picking up the morning paper the film is ok in it 's first two acts with the second act being the strongest part of the film where rachel and cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane it 's here that the tension builds and the performances really hold the scenes then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness the story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type the verdict red eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director the actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat if you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network tv thrillers then you may find some enjoyment your first time through it 's not horrible but neither is it really good
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
what begins as an intriguing thriller quickly turns into a major disappointment the teen heroine is intelligent and but held back by an inept script that never has her do the obvious call her uncle call the police tell more trustworthy adults throw in a completely unbelievable and improbable ending the final 15 minutes utterly laughable and voila ! you have wasted two hours of your life ca n't recommend this one
stellan skarsgard and diane lane two otherwise talented actors completely embarass themselves in this absurd trite and predictable thriller '' that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done skarsgard and lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash for some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script the fact that skarsgard and lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents who have presumably known them for a long time but of course what place does logic have in this movie after all while the performances are all good the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they 're given to work with every plot twist '' can be seen coming a mile away some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity case in point when skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun go insult our intelligence somewhere else and what 's with all the product placement this probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales shameless if there 's any saving grace to this movie it is leelee sobieski although it 's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey she deserves a script that equals her talent but she is certainly nice to watch especially the scene where she strips down to her bathing suit revealing her bodicious delicious nutritious body but hey when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal right rent this one first if you absolutely must see it
the first movie was fantastic the second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better this third movie was absolute trash and i will never buy it
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke stepped on we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star '' seems like a generous rating
the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened do n't even buy it it is a waist of your money
do n't even think about it
this direct to video sequel '' is actually more of a of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic noir potboiler and another of the countless and pointless direct to video sequels to come from as of late cruel intentions 2 3 starship troopers 2 shall i go on wild things 2 focuses around a rich girl susan ward whose stepfather mysteriously dies and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival son of the beach 's hot leila arcieri who claims to be the man 's true biological daughter naturally just like in the original there are plot twists aplenty as learned by an insurance investigator isiah washington giving a somewhat inspired performance and naturally there are double crosses murders and a redux of the first film 's threesome only it 's not as erotic as the original 's wild things 2 is n't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it 's good points it 's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate is it worth seeing depends how much you liked the first wild things but for the rest of us just watch the original and forget this ever happened
what does wild things 2 have going against it from the a no denise richards b no name actors c being a crappy sequel d no denise richards naked what is wrong with wild things 2 after the fact a a script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew b one sex scene a weak threesome one of the few things even linking this to the original c sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked leaving us with a body double and shot wait let me play that again ! if i seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an erotic thriller did i mention no denise richards
whatever ills are in the world it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided and totally movie for example instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and if they chose that job freely it must be their best option no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise as opportunities increase over time by having more corporations and not less to create more competition for these people 's labor and as the country becomes wealthier these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where labor laws at the urging of the un turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs as sad as it may be were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process but all the industrialized nations went through that process shortcuts '' usually produce results which are even worse however the results speak for themselves in very short period of time for example hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china india and around the world thanks for the evil '' capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also cost of living is very low there so these pennies really can go a long way do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people i guess to let people starve to death then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes and may act like a separate being '' as far the law in concerned but does a corporation have a nose feet stomach can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis of course not than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it several of the main spokepersons '' in the movie chomsky michael moore rifkin and others are renowned for their comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie you 're basically bombarded by arguments with very little of the other side presented despite the director 's claim of the opposite claim it 's more like 80 -20 just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes hey let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! dvd players or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need chomsky of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want according to him he says that you should do more important things '' like perhaps studying lingistics which he teaches but which very few care about the movie does make some correct and good observations especially regarding polution however i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the government do so many things for private companies with public funds just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies forbid government corporate welfare of any kind forbid subsidies to companies cut the suffocating red tape and regulation esp in developing countries but in the west too cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing give people all around the world a better life increase competition etc if these and other governments and not corporations ' problems were eliminated the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to century rural lifestile spoken about with much admiration people with no understanding about economics how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for
this documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies by law have an obligation to their stockholders rather than to society at large but this is n't the only case where 'people ' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities what about doctors when a doctor treats you by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you should n't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way should n't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you and what about accountants and lawyers every time an accountant handles someone 's money he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person 's life savings and give it to charity it 's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests what about the greater good and your lawyer should never act mainly for you each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally rather than giving special emphasis to her own client let 's get serious in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy it must first meet all obligations to others or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line as an ongoing business companies have reason to care about their reputations about earning loyalty from their employees etc yes some companies have done bad things just as some people have done bad things can every single person be condemned as a psychopath simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths corporations like people can do harmful dangerous things there 's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred but it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations just as it regulates people the example of bolivia where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater is an example of the failure of government why would the government give such rights to anyone even itself but when government regulation has been adequate privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous corporations and individuals should be regulated by governments if outrages are not detected and punished then government has failed but we should n't abolish government or corporations or people simply because none are perfect we should 1 hold governments accountable for performing their role 2 hold corporations accountable for legal violations through fines and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases as has happened many many times and 3 use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions if you really care about the poor around the world then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs on bad government
this movie was very much like american beauty except it was a little better this kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern american life but for all other people including myself fight club was not that good and i get the movie i am a consumer like most americans but not to a degree where i can relate to jack who is the main character starting a fight club to masculinity or one 's identity is an absurd idea what is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of fight club no wonder the only people that joins the fight club in the movie are white males no wonder that the only real people in my life that i saw raving about this movie so far has been all white men '' the movie does speak one truth modern american life has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans like i said i have not come to that point yet and i do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful people should build a family serve their community and make real friends to live a happy and significant life fight club is not necessary unless you really became like jack do not watch this movie unless you are white male watch if you are really curious but it will be a waste of time
this movie is flat out doa great filming great acting bad screenplay ! during this year that fight club came out every movie ended with a skitzo type thing and if you really want to see a good edward norton movie see primal fear this should be on the top 100 dumbest movies of all time list even if the ending was different that movie would still suck !
with such an excellent story line why was this viewer unable to connect with the characters and the events i was a young man when the terror at munich occurred i remember with clarity and outrage yet there is no real horror transmitted to the audience only the constant confusion of watching a depressing and rambling film i guess the people of the world must hide under their blankets and hope nothing bad happens again why ever take action against those who want destroy the free world gosh you could make a mistake ! in war there is never a fair and balanced response only more death and destruction the hope is that you hurt the other side more than their capacity to hurt your side then hopefully they decide to stop and the world gets another brief respite until the next war avoid this film i wish i had not seen it
wow what a disappointment great actors with a script from a fantastic book i loved the book so much i just could n't wait to see the movie and i missed it theaters so i watched it this weekend from netflix what can i say it 's boring ! i 'm not a huge fan of tom hanks especially with this hair it 's ok to hate me but i love iam mccellan and jean reno but these great actors just could n't save this movie and sofie neveau was so much more interesting in the book do n't waste your time on this one
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it the dvd we just purchased was horrible they chopped out so much of the movie it made it it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
i 'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about christianity by now thanks to this film and the book of the same title most individuals interested in christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus that being said i will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses as a movie the code leaves much to be desired there are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in the louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect for example langdon and detective neveu after successfully evading captain feche in the museum strike a series of clues writings bloodstains keys that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover langdon and detective neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions if might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction ian mckellen a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent lacks complete credibility in this film so what went catastrophically wrong well it was n't the book or its author dan brown who has been selling copies of the code faster then they can count them and although the performances were at best questionable by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie the most obvious answer as to why the code is so deficient is ron howard the director howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present the da vinci code in a manner believable as a film not history to the audience i think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with and had a supposition of jesus and his relationship to mary magdalene
this movie was loaned to me thank god i did'nt rent it and is the biggest waste of a few hours of my life ever ! the acting is so horrible it made me cringe and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for is supposed to be a black comedy it 's not funny and the so called violence in it made me yawn seriously i 've seen more gore on the simpsons there are so many things in the movie that are amazingly unbelievable sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through his neck head and two in the witherspoon overpowers sutherland for the second time and strangles him pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh but i do think everybody should watch this movie once so you can see what a movie should not be besides misery loves company
not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with freeway i am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out it has reese witherspoon after all how bad could it be well really bad first of all on a good note reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie although her character is n't all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much but reese does a good job with what shes given my main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy it 's more like a comedy that also wants to be dark graphic and serious or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny the result is that it 's a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it 's trying to do both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen but hey if you find being shot in the neck or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny you just might like this movie
even worse than wing commander yet another craptastic movie starring freddy prince junior why does it suck well first it stars fpj so you know it 's gona suck already next it just sucks that 's it the story is boring hell i do n't even remember what it 's about i saw this movie years ago and all i remember was that i hated it you know a movie sucks when the only thing you remember about it was that you despised it avoid at all costs
she 's built like a boy give me vida guerra anyday
teri hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money but for her and her ample body on ample display this movie is just not worth the time terrible direction awful story miserable music ! !
man i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking but it should be illegal ! this is first off a terrible dvd full screen format with a dark muddy picture worse the plot is typical predictable and poorly written other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body sitting through this fiasco is a total bore i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this that is probably the fault of the director erik anjou a director at best ! who has done a total of two movies and one documentary gee i wonder why he is n't in more demand not ! ! i can enjoy b '' movies and bad movies but this one is just so totally that it is not even good enough to laugh at i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger 29 teri hatcher nude rent this if you must but wow there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad
i have to say that even though teti hatcher 's performance was good the movie itself was terrible the plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable i can t believe i wasted my money on this one
by the time you see the ending you 'll already be wishing that you had n't watched this movie
this is pitiful how do you maximize profit easy minimize quality on every level and capitalize on the brand name in other words raise expectations through the roof with a superior detective series and use this momentum to sell an inferior series under the same name ghost in the shell gig says cheap '' from the opening credit montage to the bare bone ending credits the colors unlike the first season 's which were deep and juicy are dry and monochromatic at times the inventive little things that embellished the philosophy and look of the first series are completely lost on this one which seems less specific and more abstract even the presentation shouts economy '' the first season 's packaging included a booklet this one nothing oh i forgot to add that the art for both boxes look thrown together and let 's not forget the animation there are a lot of clever things being verbalized but by it being called animation '' i do n't expect to sit through ten minutes of dialogue to see something anything move another clever little trick to save money the look of the characters from batou to kusanagi have been altered considerably kusanagi 's eyes are bigger and her body seems shorter and less voluptuous batou 's arms are shorter the lean chiseled features of aramaki which made him appear old and wise are now younger and fuller the mecha and weapons in this series are also vague the individual eleven are not as interesting as the laughing man plot of the first season 's series i had high hopes for this series there was a lot of thought and creativity behind the first season of gits it was better in my opinion than samurai champloo though not as popular i still believe that as this current storyline spins out that it will be better than most of the series out there unfortunately this one will not even come close to the first season and this will probably be the last season for this franchise too bad
i could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety i think i made it about 45 minutes in despite many fine actors esp the always interesting jeff bridges who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles i simply could not connect and did not care about these people it was this huge budget american movie shorthand we 're supposed to care because we 've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else but it just does n't work for me if i do n't care this far into the movie it just wo n't happen visually beautiful and sky high production values on costumes and sets it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of but why do n't we get faces like that in the major characters of course chris cooper has that kind of face but many others esp all the size 2 women '' in the supporting roles seem to have stepped out of a commercial the chicago tribune called this film sleek and beautiful '' i will completely agree with that but so are music videos i kept asking myself what is wrong what is misfiring i really wanted to like it some of it is the story telling but the look was almost too pretty when the cinematography is this gorgeous you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger ultimately i began wondering if the original length was much longer and it was cut down so much that it became fractured and if that is the case my apologies to the director this is the kind of film that makes me ponder what is it that european get '' that we lose in our big budget studio films is the system itself hurting some films by sanitizing and conforming them when they need to stick out like an unruly horse 's nose at the starting gate very beautiful but no connection and not satisfying well that 's a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell is n't it there are lots of special features on this dvd but if i ca n't sit through the film i do n't care about the extras so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it ! i hear the book is something wonderful
i was thrilled when i first read that mlb productions was finally issuing a dvd version of highlights of the baltimore orioles ' three world series victories i already owned the vhs versions one of which the 1970 world series had a major flaw in the audio synchronization watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film finally i could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 world series much to my dismay the mlb logo is permanently and obtrusively displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs what 's that all about does mlb productions think i 'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills thank goodness i do n't own a plasma tv or i 'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years ! sound and picture quality are okay otherwise but logo is really annoying
the movie directors in the me particularly iranians are responding to demands by the west for certain type of movies they produce what is demanded from them in turn they receive awards cultural industry empowers these demands they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded there is no single me movie which depict the story of western imperialism in the me and then awarded for doing so me movies must show that me women are in need of emancipation me cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized civilization itself is presented in vertical sense there is a civilization somewhere out there all measterners are expected to reach yet it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country who deprived them of education and knowledge the west is represented by beautiful blonde nurses a nice american guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his everyday western knowledge of medicine '' in the midst of total ignorance and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs such a nice way to civilize ! the story of afghanistan is real however the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it rather it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand in producing a product that can sell well the situation is miserable but what caused such misery in afghanistan your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is islam it is that islamic culture that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors there is no single implying in the movie a smallest reference that afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the british and then the russian and now americans who played their great game on the chessboard of eurasia there is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them those imperialists came in the name of civilization french did to algeria the british did to india all in the name of bringing them civilization it was white man 's burden to do so yet makhmalbaf needs more awards he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of western audiences in order to continue to be in demand you did a nice job applauses go on anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read foucault 's works and edward said 's orientalism
i have n't seen a movie so since the contender they did n't even try to make good arguments for the side i hate to use the term liberal bias but in this case it fits like a glove the cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie i felt like the gun companies were the underdogs pure garbage
i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars this movie is nothing but propaganda i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this but it was like watching a train wreck i just had to stay for the end you know for those of you who do n't know firearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year and mine was one of them this movie cd might make a good coaster but beyond that it is trash some less than truthful nra member '' yeah right wrote '' i really liked and enjoyed this movie the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention it will keep yours too just give it a chance sure it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry but they deserve it and need to be more responsible i may buy the dvd to watch it again but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from and not gotten around to watching however i may add this to my collection ! '' horse hockey member of the nra more like member of the micheal moore fan club this was the worst movie i have ever seen they even had to lie to get you in the theater as nothing was mentioned about it being in the trailers ! and saying that it was a little bit slanted '' is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie ! !
never have i seen a movie violate a book so badly john grisham 's runaway jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction in which the widow of a smoker takes on big tobacco in the courtroom the movie runaway jury is a suspense chase in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers this movie is at most a caricature of the book and not a flattering one at that hackman transforms fitch 's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall parts of marlee 's past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events the most interesting aspects of the story jury selection and nicholas easter 's manipulation of the court are grudgingly presented in montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around if i had never read the book i would consider this a flick at best but knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad even if you are n't a lover of fiction i highly recommend buying the book instead
stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic not one single fact '' about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film i had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won what a crock
this is not a george romero project directed and written by ken wiederman film contains profane language gross bloody effects thom matthews returns as a different character joey '' james karen returns as a different character ed '' jonathan terry returns as glover '' allan trautman returns as tarman '' brian peck returns as 5 different zombies pussface '' thriller '' jaw '' '' and the zombie on the car roof a truck that is traveling across a bridge is carrying pressurized cases that contain cadavers one case falls off the truck and ends up in the water a group of kids find the case and triggers the gas inside that spreads across the cemetary the living dead return also in the cast thor van lingen dana ashbrook mitch pileggi dvd only contains audio commentary and theatrical trailer
after the scary and funny return of the living dead '' i could n't wait to see this one know what turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the pits ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! how could they have blown this movie so bad ! ! not funny not scary and not worth the price ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! !
yeah that 's how i felt when i noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture how can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour regardless it 's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery the kid is downright annoying but when i was a kid i liked him ! suppose it 's not time to have kids yet aye regardless it could have been better flawed but if you viewed this before the first one do n't let it stop you from getting the first ! the first one rocked i thought the one was produced much better than this as well but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 i once again heard were terrible
in the film commentary director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying 'i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it ' that 's a paraphrase and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad the director did n't know what it was about the weird atonal score by gerald busby was an annoyance throughout often drowning out the dialog it 's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear or in a psychological thriller just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho only in this film the creepy music played on and on that was it no nuances no alteration no variance no imagination just the same creepy atonal 'psycho ' music all the time duvall and spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time and sequences conveying mystery suspense drama what got it they convey confusion ! that 's it ! the was confused ! a waste of talent and a waste of my time watching it it is one of those films i watched thinking it had to get better it did n't
i am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf i had to return it
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information and to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond we are truly in trouble the truth is out there and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd but this dvd is maybe worth a glance but not a long hard look
one star is evidently the required minimun this documentory in my opinion distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda if you are looking for the truth you wo n't find it here there are people who by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other americans spread for one or more reasons for personal or political agenda or both in some cases such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country this is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent americans consider as evidenced by the nature of their words acts and reasoning they have a right say their piece and present their documentary regardless of their motive caution beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives ! when a person organization or government wants to see america harmed and americans dead i being an american consider their comments as a serious threat to americans american interest and america 's security americans who doe n't consider such declorations as a threat are either people or my enemy there is no third option
in 1998 clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction terrorist are americas greatest threat clinton swept the first bombing of wtc under the rug the failed the american people numnerous times america fights terrorist who are the true infidels they will kill behead drag our bodies down streets every chance they can many are in total denial of how terriorst in iraq iran syria and other countries are it is amazing how americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies terrorist

even though the show is on a downfall hoping to end soon the cover looks vaguelly familiar oh yes it looks like friends not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows it does n't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season dvd set
the only reaosn this show gets more than one star is because at the very least you can see that money is spent on it the presentation is solid however if i wanted to watch let alone buy a series which is centered around a bunch of wanking rich kids i would walk around at the highschool i graduated from 7 years ago its all the same uninteresting that people escape come graduation time senior year ive listened to scattered episodes from several seasons as background noise after whatever i was watching before it but the show itself is aweful like i said a bunch of rich kids with nothing to gripe about griping about nothing bottom line happens you either get passed it or you dont maybe my take on it is skewed by living born and raised in santa barbara ca which is about 2 hours north of the real oc but is riddled with the same kinds of problems i would rather kill my time watching grass grow than sit down and actually watch this kind of dribble do yourself a favor read a book rather than buying the dvds of the o
this is one of my favorite movies but i was very disappointed with the dvd version in the middle of the movie you will have to get up go to your dvd player and flip the dvd over to the second side to see the rest of the movie i do n't know what bozo came up with that idea but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie who wants to get up and flip the dvd over in the middle of the suspense this format takes stupidity to the next level i would highly recommend the vhs since i have it and it 's wonderful i would not recommend the dvd until they do a better version the packaging is in paper and not durable at all another truly bad idea dvd 's should be in plastic cases not paper
this movie comes from john grisham 's novel of the same title most of the actions taking place in the novel were also presented in this movie the spotlight reviews goodly summarize the movie even when i do n't agree with their rankings the first movie 's problem is the character 's personalities less credible many times one reviewer well said the fbi 's personnel looks rather wimpy the merciless coal fletcher looks like a simple clerk while he is the real president in the novel on the other hand the novel 's heroine darby shaw losses her strong personality but at the same time behaves in obnoxious ways for example in one scene she asks her best female friend to spread a gossip in college but darby does not care whatsoever for her friend 's safety as in the novel darby even tells her that it 's not good for her darby to stay there '' darby does all the opposite in the novel next her friend does all what she says this not credible the second movie 's error is the way the show the events for example as i said fletcher is not portrayed as a tough way there 's even an scene where we see his seeing his family 's picture at his desk really charming however he is still punished in the movie any honest person who does not let to be impressed by the reputations of the actors and director should admit that the movie is not always understandable i watched this movie right when released in 1992 and i did n't understand it but the huge julia roberts ' success was on its highest so i did n't think much just considered it was sort of boring now i read the novel watched the movie again and understood the movie was flawed in fact all bad guys in the movie were only small fishes who chased darby i also complain that the movie shows some misbehaviour as good ones for example in one scene the president asks the fbi chief voyles to stop a crime investigation voyles offers to do it in exchange of favours this is plain corruption yet the movie made it look like a cocktail party ! in another scene one character callahan is about to start driving while drunk and darby only plays a little bit to stop him just to finally let him get on his car the movie added a few action scenes the novel does n't have yet it is quite boring the novel has less action yet it is more exciting
so i can see there are some julia roberts fans out there too bad just raving about her will never improve her acting skills an oxymoron actually the poor quality of this movie is astounding considering its director the cast excepting our girl julia and the book upon which it was based though he 's done some much better work when pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing hmm 'presumed innocent ' was a winner let 's follow that same formula and do another one it 'll sell '' unfortunately by the time the story from the book by john grisham got to the screen it lacked any of its original punch as for denzel he should be ashamed of himself he 's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach i guess he probably needed the cash for another house then again he 's opposite julia no further comment needed than save your money
i watched this movie with no particular bias about i understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided i think that for most people it is highly effective but it did n't work for me i think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew perspective and propaganda when they talk about the sweatshops in china and honduras i found myself though i dont envy the workers laughing at the movie i used to live in china and i have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there it is the film makers and then the and they are assuming the viewers who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with that is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist not only a problem with the movie also discuss how employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that pays very little and then suggests that it 's employess go on public assitance but the truth is that is the same for the companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits i do believe should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more positions but that is a business culture that expands well past i am a teacher who can not work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits but i do n't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools
for those of you who are not sure where you stand on the issue this piece of pure elitist culture of fear '' rabidly propaganda is junk this dvd is haters sewing together the most microscopic disinformation in order inspire people to despise a corporation that has the power to restrict union organizing in their business that 's the whole enchilada for these if you have any concern about issues relating to power economic and social consequences and the direction retail marketing is going do not expect to get much out of this but some hitlerian diatribe about the evil empire of try reading some good articles or watching other documentaries but if you 're just too lazy to think for yourself and want to be sucked into this caricature of corporate hatred by all means go over to the darkside luke i wish i could give this zero stars
first off special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality but at least this is better than the abomination that was jaws the only dinosaur movie i can think of that 's worse than this is raptor which consists of parts of the three carnosaur movies cut pasted together it has some redeeming feature in that ian malcom and john somedoy i forget his last name the guy who owns the park were actually interesting characters i guess steve speilberg finally realised that attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey 's rear end about unfortunately the boring stereotypical alan grant was the central character in this if you want to watch a steven spielburg movie that 's actually good watch or something or the lost world jurassic park '' even though recommending a sequel may seem lame the sequel is a million times better than this if you want to see a dinosaur movie then watch either the sequel to this movie or arthur conan doyle 's the lost world '' i would also recomend the 'carnosaur ' movies but i think they 're out of print if you want to see a movie where sam neill plays an interesting chracter watch 'in the mouth of madness ' or 'triangle' but definitely avoid this movie the only reason i even own it is because it was sold in a box set with the lost world jurassic park
this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee another movie with a black guy hello eddie murphy who because it 's perfectly fine in pc hollyweird calls charlie sheen and everyone else who is not black a host of nasty names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist tucker plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a but like most of his other movies he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter '' '' hey bob what will we have tucker do next hey i know let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second screenwriter '' hey great idea fred i sure do n't have any ideas '' apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor i pity you
this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses
i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch '' that is how good it is
you can find most of these dvds in one fell swoop on already if you use the search term dvd lot '' and you will end up paying about half the total cost these are all warner bros snapcase dvds by the way yep they come in those cases that drive everyone insane because they are cheap beyond a reasonable doubt it would n't surprise me if half these titles are updated by warner with new special editions in awesome packaging in the next 2 years or so shop around folks these are the same movies you see countless times at your local pawn shop for half the cost here there 's nothing special here to be had and chances are you 'll be paying for at least one title you do n't want
i have to agree with those who are disappointed with this volume highlights for me were ragtime '' and how now dow jones '' my favourite item in the 3 volumes would have to be let 's take a glass '' from dvd 2. i love the original cast cd of grand hotel '' but never saw it on stage so seeing this number alone was worth the all the bad items on the discs let 's hope they continue to show truly great performances from both old shows and new i look forward to reliving the amazing tommy tune choreography from will rogers follies '' that hopefully will be seen in a future collection
whatever it takes this movie was not even worth my time in watching it i even heard it was so good i bought it and i hate it ! i love movies but this one was not one i will ever watch again and struggled to get through the first time ! reading the synopsis will let you know just what the plot of this movie is my thoughts skip this one all together
this was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but it left me just feeling sad that i spent money to buy it the characters are predictable the plot is well i should have seen it coming however there are a couple of funny moments that 's why i give this movie one star
this movie is a borderline chick flick definitely it is not an innovative movie but has some very funny characters but everything in this movie has been done before
i did not enjoy the movie as much as i thought i would they left out alot of the parts in the book where your mind could just picture it so clear and vivid i did this as a read aloud slightly modified with my students i was really excited when i found a movie to go with it and showed the class it it 's rated pg which for the material of the book is really a clue as to them leaving out alot of stuff my class enjoyed most of the book and felt the movie did n't do it justice i agree
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly was n't expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times
ok so first lets get one thing strait this is one of the worst movies ever and thats about so i really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and did n't even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and ella is singing alright that does n't even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down i really sugest that you do n't wast your time on this movie its not funny cute profitible not anything except bad its a wast of time to watch this movie
oh dear this movie was an abomination why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead i can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book 's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers but honestly there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal and the film design ! bleh ! maybe it would be appealing to girls but to me it looked garish cheap and really fake the costuming was slightly better than our high school plays and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated i felt so much dumber after watching this movie i feel like i need an iq test or a good book speaking of good books ella enchanted is one of my favorites i do n't know why i thought of that book just now i guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it but not much
i have only one question about this movie and that is why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book if you have n't read the book than you do n't know what i 'm talking about but if you have then you do i ca n't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would 've been if it had been adapted correctly half the time while watching this i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something the colors were so bright if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes locations characters and details from the story then everyone would love it not just 5 year olds it makes me so angry when i watch this movie yes its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing everytime i loan someone the book i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all in fact it is a hundred times better more even i am really disappointed i just do n't get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie than i suggest they do it right and if they do then i 'll be very thankful i just do n't get it the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better you would n't believe how much better it is i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book next time please please do it right
i am a fitness trainer myself and she does great workouts but they are fast paced a very over weight person or a beginner would become discouraged this is not what you want to purchase if you are just starting out
there are several things wrong with these 1. like other users have mentioned the beat is off 2. the outside cover fails to mention that you need a step bench and weights 3. her banter does get a little annoying 4. and this is the biggest for me the actual workout time is only 24 mins long ! definitely not worth the i got the one minute workout minna lessig for the same price and find it a lot more interesting the positives these routines will make you sweat but are not for those with weak joints as many exercises place pressure on lunges jumping jacks jumping kicks etc
first of all 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks second of all i missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain also regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises it is still moderately difficult
saw this as an inflight movie boy did i pray for engine trouble so we 'd have to land and i could get away ! sucks or what i liked smith in 'i robot ' 'independence day ' etc but this was awful it 's a movie problem is the one joke was the one plastered all over the tv spots and trailers the jet ski incident the highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool wish that 'd been the main storyline instead far far superior ! will not be adding this to my wishlist
bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because i generally enjoy will smith 's movies while there are some funny moments i found the plot unconvincing and the characters very two dimensional obviously this is meant to be a romantic comedy and i was n't expecting any depth but this was supremely shallow hitch the date doctor supports inept men in finding their dream partner all the while he himself has not recovered from a traumatic college romance so guess what he has commitment issues enter attractive journalist who funnily enough also has commitment issues behaves in a totally neurotic fashion is incapable of adult conversation and because she has issues exposes hitch as the date doctor in newsprint using the time honoured phrase people deserve the truth come on it 's not politics despite her behaving like a jilted teenager hitch discovers his deep love for her and you ca n't help thinking that you yourself would be running a mile in his place i sat there wondering whether it would get better and waiting for it to end if you want romantic comedy you could do better with something like guess who meet the fockers prime or even the old classics '' you 've got mail or return to me but give this one a miss
in hitch '' will smith plays a henry higgins who for a tidy fee will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn eliza doolittles only in this case the elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams of course the irony is that hitch does n't adhere to his own formula being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself until that is he meets the woman of his own dreams sara a new york city gossip columnist who has no idea what it is hitch does for a living it occurs to me that when it comes to certain movie genres action movies and romantic comedies in particular it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we 've already seen a hundred times before even the best romantic comedies ca n't entirely avoid paying homage to the formula '' and hitch '' is clearly no exception as such the film has some mildly amusing moments some endearingly sweet scenes and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films i mean do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine 's sidekicks is a preposterously effeminate gay man it seems like every time hitch '' is about to win us over it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious smith makes for a smooth romantic lead but eva mendes does n't always seem up to the challenge of her role particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity actually of the performers it is kevin james king of queens '' as an overweight klutz who has hired hitch 's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress who walks off with the film even though he 's only a supporting player it does n't take him long to assume center stage in the film essentially relegating the leads to second banana status
the picture and sound quality is very bad it has not improved since the amos andy shows were released on vhs if they can not be restored a disclamer of the bad picture and sound quality should be published for the dvd and the price should be lowered significantly
i enjoy reading everyone 's reviews and respect their opinions to towles nostalgia fan thank god for an african american who finally sees this show for what it is and reports that he feels so highly about amos and andy it erks '' me to see so many people putting this show down based on the fact that they feel it puts the african american race in a bad light towles sees what any thinking person sees that this is a wonderfully funny show with wonderful and talented actors who deserve to be watched and enjoyed by present day audiences as it was by past audiences as he says there are many shows now and in the recent past which are similar to amos and andy in content and which have never been treated like this show bill cosby went on a crusade to try and keep this show from being seen on tv and it looks as if he will be successful for all time to come thank god for their release on dvd to zegnorch and his comment about these 44 eppies '' being all that are available they are n't depending on where you look and who sells them some unethical there are tv episodes and the 2 cartoons and movie amos and andy is the hardest show i have ever seen to find reliable information on after looking on every web site selling the shows and finding that they differ in most everything they say about it i have come to believe that the sellers will say anything in order to make a sell saying theirs is the definitive collection all available episodes are included saying they sell only quality discs and others use and copies to one seller admitting to me in an reply to a question i asked him that he sold copies he made on his home dvd recorder and sold them on please be aware of these problems so hopefully we can all get the very best copies of any program we wish to own they are selling for anywhere from 24.99 300.00 per collection some sellers are not telling the truth in order to make money i do not know anything about the quality origin or about the producer of this collection buyer beware !
i can not get thru this one i started but there did n't appear to have any good spots when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this i thought this has to be good i had just finished a movie where he starred ca n't remember the name of it i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it tori spelling is well known but not to me someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start she does not play a flake very well and i do n't know what to call her except a flake i stopped this dvd in about the first hour and will go back and give it another shot but with tori spelling as one of the leads i already know this one does not have a prayer i would say save your money on this one unless you are under 13. i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that do n't this one falls into this category one that came with this one was the broken hearts club '' and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage
like most indie gay themed movies trick '' had quite a bit of buzz around it a terrific movie with tori spelling ! how could i not love it i loved die mommy die ! girls will be girls '' and jeffrey '' so i got ta love this too right right i found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality a hot boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb uh why so they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy and then it 's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans as much as i ca n't stand tori spelling 's acting '' she 's the only performer not phoning it in maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots what little life there is in this movie it owes it to her the problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking the sizzling '' dancer looked like bored monkey and the soft sensitive gabriel has no personality why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery i guess if boy dropped the zero and found another guy which would n't be too much of an effort for him there would n't be much of a movie a cameo by miss coco peru is a nice treat but she 's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish you 'd think she was in a different movie high expectations very low gratification honestly skip it
the story here dose n't matter the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction meth quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless roberts is so gay you want to smack his face he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius a role he plays better than anyone today in film br
okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as bring it on '' clueless '' mean girls '' and especially the superior heathers '' is painting a false picture of what this movie i 'm sorry but john tucker must die '' is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films these other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers jtmd '' appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to and wonder is all i did this film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all the results are one big mess 2.5 stars is all i can the other films mentioned above are the ticket heathers '' 5 stars mean girls '' 4 stars bring it on '' 4 stars clueless '' 4.5 stars all four of these movies have something that john tucker must die '' doesnt
never mind 's that it 's pretty stupid john tucker must die '' like a lot of movies about actually hates high school and just about everybody in it and by extension american kids it 's the kind of movie that if parents caught an hour of it would make them think less of their children for watching it and to a fearsome extent pretending to live it out early in the movie one character a cheerleader remarks about stealing her mother 's estrogen pills well guys use steroids to build their pecs '' that estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader 's breasts is laughable but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them that could be most casual sickening line of the year but it is what to expect from hollywood screenwriters in their who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild girlie comedy not unlike those fabulous laguna beach '' hacks who use insidious and i mean insidious editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched again and again in the sloppiest manner to the previous line of dialogue jtmd '' asks us to believe that the title character jesse metcalf simultaneously dates three women ashanti sophia bush arielle kebbel without them knowing it is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town owns a great car stays in hotels for basketball road games and my personal favorite owns and drives a yacht he and his brother have no parents to speak of neither do the three girls unless you count the cheerleader 's mom reference one of them bush is an avowed vegan vixen however and when they discover they 've all been dating the same guy in gym class they get in a brawl and are not suspended but sent to a detention without a teacher is this a satire as jtmd '' bills itself an edgy comedy a smarter cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline in this world for looking at each other funny and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news a cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete but say head of the drama club a cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase brat girls but sweet emotional sunny girls a cleverer film would know a dark comedy if that 's what jtmd '' intends to be ca n't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven instead we have a fourth smart '' girl brittany snow is introduced as the girls ' grand taming of the shrew '' plan to woo john and eventually stomp his heart this angel of course begins to fall for john who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy which are if we follow our mtv two of the trinity the last being sheer cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have preferably brown that makes up male desirability director betty thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading in an empowered open society that has a foreign hindu woman as ceo of pepsi represents the canopy of female of achievement go figure you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid ! we 've been pounding this earth for years now why do teens and young women still trail along lapping it up there is no real wit in the movie that you ca n't see from some comic being fed lines on a program no style no genuine attitude it 's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty young rotten unidealistic america most interested in getting tail getting even and throwing parties it is not immoral so much as it blank a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic most involving of young bodies what fools hollywood sees our children to be wants them to be what numb donkey fools if you need more proof jenny mccarthy has been cast as the voice of reason and she 's borderline believable ya know so much ugliness is spewed about islamofascists '' these manaical stoneaged fiends who apparently ca n't tell you the sky is blue spending most of their time taping martyr videos finding mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life consider though that one of the more recognizable items in muslim countries is the satellite dish a year from now this thing 's on a movie channel and well whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the american decline into shame they 've got it not because it 's absent morals but humanity the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be
do n't sit and wait for this movie to get better because it does n't the only worthwhile part is near the beginning when you get to watch brad pitt act like a lunatic he plays the role of a psycho in a ward very funny but aside from that the movie is pointless aside from pitt the acting is bad this movie resembles a b '' movie it 's awful time travel but you never see it and the whole 12 monkeys thing it does n't exist very low budget do n't waste your time
if you are the type that likes happy endings avoid this movie ! bruce willis dies and he does n't save the world and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all it reminded me of arlington road where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie also in this movie the repetitive flashbacks to bruce 's airport dream were overdone by the time i was saying i got it already '' and by the or flashback i was ready to throw something at the screen in the featurette terry gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a european art movie '' he did and i hate european art movies on the other hand if you like such things you 'll probably like the film it was well acted
i thought for sure i would enjoy this but i found myself looking at the time and wondering when it would be over stowe is good as are the others but the story just did not engage me
the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this to catch it on tbs or something
yeah ok ice cube is a bounty hunter and mike epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys am i right on that right the story is great but not that great so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky thats what it was like for me folks god i almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this for cube and epps and eva mendes fans only and if you wan na see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it then this is the film for you
wow it 's rare i consider a movie absolutely horrendous but this one qualifies we are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie i found myself yelling die already '' when he does n't kill himself in the end all i wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him a dumb stupid awful indie '' movie that is a waste of film time and effort
we must have reached the end of days our civilization as we know it is over when films like these get made what can i say this home video is so amateurish it should not have ever found its way into my video store because the premise sounded promising and the cast was decent i gave this title a try mistake ! big mistake ! the film is a random compilation of pointless scenes dwelling on the melodramatic life of paul rudd who because he failed as an actor wants to kill himself yet i am never given any believable insight into his soul nor do i care about his failure this is some of the whiniest filmmaking i have ever seen who ever made this film is trying too hard to be heard although apparently has very little to say
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with mcginly 's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast which included hacks like paul rudd was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and who have graced some of his previous work please sean stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff leave that to idiots like capra wenders scorcese etc they are not in your league
i think producer mo ramchandani should be commended for his integrity in honestly reviewing his own film this is rare in an industry that is proliferated with bald old men who are more interested in turning a profit than producing a good film this was by far the worst film i have ever seen i urge anybody on this page not to waste their time director sean mcginly should have been fired on the first day of shooting and replaced with anyone even a farm animal and then maybe the psycholgical complexities of suicide would have been better explored i look forward to more from producer mo ramchandani its clear he 's not going to make teh smae mistake twice ! ! ! !
i tend to agree with mo ramchandani 's review this is a terrible film and given that it went straight to video is a miracle it really should have gone straight to radio what is interesting is how our friend albert made the connection between mo ramchandani who reveiwed the film and mohit ramchandani who produced two days could they be the same person pherhaps but what is more obvious is that albert is really an alias for acclaimed director sean mcginly continues promoting his film i am a huge fan of mcginly 's other work starring karl wiedergott the truth about juliet '' sheer genius ! ! speaking of strange charcters how would albert come to the conclusion that mo ramchandani is filing a petty grieveance could he not juts be an honest producer who has gone on to bigger and better things
they say that art reflects society and it is no wonder that bush is president and the whole world has gone mad killing each other over religion when movies like two days are made the film is the worst i have ever seen by far a motiveless paul rudd who gives a terrible performance tries to convince us that he wants to kill himself cause he cant get work as an actor in sunny la and afford a bmw this in itself is a flawed idea but trust me when i tell you it sinks lower than dolly partons as the story or lack there off unfolds no real characters just cliche 's absolutely no direction whatsoever nothing is achieved visually just a bunch of talking heads that fail to convince us of anything else except what fools we were for watching this film by the end of it i wanted to kill myself in couldnt wait two days ! ! ! who made this film
this romantic comedy was charming funny and clever i recommend it to anyone who does n't have a problem with heavy british accents if you do try it with captions it was fun funny and a nice when one needs a lift
hello i wo n't sell you on the 's one of my favorites and you can read other 's opinions there what i will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages or freezing up the player so far we 've had to return episode one 2 times one time it came with 2 identical discs one disc one two discs two and one disc 4 we 've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they 're not playable it will play fine on one disc then the next disc it crashes pixilates or wo n't load at all we do n't have this problem with any other movies so beware watch all the episodes before you put it on your shelf and be prepared and if you are a true fan you will do this to keep on trying until all the discs work all that i can figure is that they were n't sure they 'd sell big mistake and made them cheap what a shame good luck
i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good but make no mistake this is propaganda aimed at children i will not be showing it to my kids despite the freewheeling title the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys case in point atalanta a princess finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world on her father 's horse she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ladies first '' the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal our hosts '' infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas are revolting there should be a law against using mel brooks ' voice for a baby apparently i repressed memories of these creatures but seeing them again brought back the horror needless to say i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry overall this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children
first i saw the stage play then too long ago saw the the opening scene where our hero '' turns the page of the book on how to succeed in business '' you start smiling and think oh yes ! if only in real life it was so easy then you are swept in our hero cunning and coniving ways to get to the top love him or despise him you are hooked great songs great sets great it when he meets another ladder climbing opponent and the clever way he beats him also the scene with the knitting is quite so over the top you can not help yourself but love the guy top marks lf ps my mark was for 5 it was saved with only one star
i was very disappointed with this dvd the last reviewer was spot on in their review if you just want to see and hear some of these celebs talking then get this dvd but if you want more insight as to the photos how they 're taken etc then do n't waste your money on this
saw the previews of the first movie but i was n't expecting too much from that i tried to finish both the first and the second but that did n't work out too well i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie and that includes the first all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
tyrese gibson for worst actor ever up to this point i 've been a huge paul walker fan for his comedically bad acting he 's made a career of it in this one his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word bro '' at least 75 times to give his character street cred and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops it 's clear walker is deeply considering his plight but really walker ca n't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of tyrese gibson my god where did they find this guy the movie would 've been ok as a standard mindless action film but it really was ruined by the grade drama club acting now you might be wonderning who 's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie but wait there 's actually method to this madness since their was no vin diesel the director knew he had only paul walker left and it 's well known that walker can not carry a film see timeline '' so what to do of course ! find an actor even worse than walker and cast them together ! all of the sudden walker does n't look so terrible because everyone 's focusing on this other chump and apparently it worked because a lot of people enjoyed this film and there 's even a sequel
one hell of a waste of money ! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like i was you are in for a hell of a disappointment ! the only reason why i think the first one was bad ass is cause vin diesel was in it and yeah it was totally bad ass ! i 'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed in this movie you get two real cars this time a 1969 camaro ss and a 1970 dodge challenger and they both get destroyed ! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars ! god all mighty ! do n't waste your money on this movie i would n't take this disappointment if it was given to me ! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie buy frost bite ! you wo n't be disappointed
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
i paid for the movie and never received it nor did i get my money back from
i bought this dvd because i really adore the strokes good music good people good style not so good documentary whoever made this video should not make anymore at all ! the strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures 10 second clips of them the exclusive interviews '' were not that exclusive no sound from any of the strokes no interviews with them i can go on i mean c'mon a documentary of the strokes should at least have the strokes in it right
the story of the strokes is the story of wealth and privilege and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like lou reed and vu riffs this was made without rca and so lacks strokes music the band apparently wanted nothing to do with it it is practically diy with no interviews this just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project their album sucked anyway
this dvd sucks im a die hard strokes fan and expected the dvd to open up with some strokes music or and interview or is absolutely no strokes music and they have a few like stock photos of them doin their thing live but other than that this dvd is a complete not waste ur money go buy their two albums instead
it 's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning but skip this one you should be sleeping i am a strokes fan so when new york stories came out i had to have it much to my disappointment it turned out to contain no music by the strokes or interviews with any members of the band if you still feel like you need to see this dvd do n't pay more than 5 for it you have been officially warned
as mentioned in another review stolen scenes from runaway train not just clips but entire scenes also the plane crash scene from cliffhanger still worth 3 4 for a dvd just for the other action
i have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst i could n't believe i wasted 2 hours of my life on it they literally stole scenes from runaway train in this not the ideas they stole the filmed scenes the train kept going from one engine to the four in rt the continuity was a joke had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky rodney eastman was in the movie for about 5 mins but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
con express '' has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action is n't enough and in between stunt pieces and the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a company producing this i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably wo n't mind this one too much just go easy on it
ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this a silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer down on his luck the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property and hides his car trying to escape a finance the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine in one early scene they have a funeral casket and all for a monkey yuk gloria swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script though she despises movies that talk '' she waves her hands about and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene she falls for the screen writer william holden and wo n't let him out of her sight the film was made in 1950 and swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50 not exacty over the hill if we look at many of today 's movie stars but she 's treated in the film as though she much much older i thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film my heavens at 50 she could still be in movies and from the amount of money she apparently had did n't need to be living in such a dark creepy house film did n't make sense sorry i bought it it was ridiculous
this movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand once again larry clark delivers a film which is nothing more than for him to see a bunch of teen kids naked it 's kids but with a murder plo
from the opening line of bully '' in which 'marty ' explicitly mentions oral sex i knew i was n't going to like this film thank goodness i saw it on hbo and did n't waste my money on a rental once again we have another movie about dysfunctional white families in which the kids are a bunch of spoiled brats with parents that are nothing more than inneffectual clueless dolts wow what a stretch for an indie '' film although this movie is based on a novelized true '' story by reporter jim schutze about a murder that took place in florida the screenwriter and director seem only halfway interested into getting into the minds of the kids that committed this horrible crime wasting the other half of the movie with scenes of gratuitous sex and nudity that gives this movie the feel of a flick that 's intended to appeal to on top of that the girl who instigated the murder was described in shutze 's book as chubby and plain while the film makers took artistic license '' in their casting of cute petite little rachel miner as lisa i guess the director figured that a chubby girl could n't incite a young boy to kill for her even though that 's what happened in the book ! or perhaps the film makers wanted a young girl for all the teeneie nudity the role required at the of the is a violent murder and director larry clark is uncompromising in his portrayal of the brutality of the act bobby the 'bully ' is reduced from a sadistic closet to a screaming baby begging for his life as he is repeatedly stabbed ultimately his best friend marty cuts his throat murder is a horrifying messy act and director clark gives you a view of what a real murder may look like this 5 minute scene should be clipped and shown to any kid that 's considering committing such an awful act it is truly hard to watch other than that the film is just trash larry clark could have effectively made all of his points without all the graphic sex nudity dirty language and the dildo scene in bobby 's bedroom what hurts the film 's believeability even more is the stereotypical treatment of the kids ' parents as disconnected morons who act as unknowing enablers to these kids ' rotten lifestyles liberal love to blame the parents and not a pop culture environment that glorifies sex drugs and violence teaching our kids disobedience in spite of all that parents try to do to counteract this onslaught the 5 minute scene portrying the murder of bobby kent should be used as part of a 'scared straight ' program for gangsters the rest of the movie belongs in the dumpster 'nuff said'
i wanted to like block party i dig chappelle 's comedy i like most of the musical line up and have read lots of great reviews of this film so i expected to enjoy this movie more than i did anticipating maybe total minutes of chappelle doing new stand up material between the music sets i found the block party 's paucity of its host 's performance disappointing given it 's called block party '' but it 's still reasonable to assume that the dave chappelle 's '' part indicates that dave will actually give a performance during it maybe dave chappelle hosts a block party featuring mostly other performers '' would be a more apt title the musical guests gave great performances those watching mostly for the music are n't likely to be disappointed those watching for the comedy however be prepared for a lot of music and a few human interest clips with locals in dave 's ohio town and at a brooklyn daycare not dave performing any new stand up material or skits the great reviews this film got in most media are n't for new chappelle comedy material rather for the movie 's concept message and music
if you 're a fan of chappelle 's humor do n't bother yes he paid for it but he 's abusing his reputation with this one to the point of fraud no standup a few rehashed liners from the show he bailed on if you 're a fan of hip hop soul just buy the cds of the artists ! no full sets and obnoxious cuts into pointless commentary if you 're looking to be haughty as a fan of 'whatever that documentary from ' was called that 's cool if you 're waiting to actually be entertained this disc is busted i love soul but this fails to satisfy
how in the world that dave chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery so now that he choked a 50 million dollar pay day away he got smart knows he does n't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place this is a insult to wattstaxx that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess the music acts on here are lame as well you want the big acts of today not no milk carton or having acts the only thing funny about this film is that it got made was released glad his corny show is no more good riddence this movie is equally bad as well
i just opened a box with a cesar millan book and this dvd imagine my surprise i do n't like the pairing of this book with cesar 's stuff either ! now i have an extra errand and cost to ship back if anything like this ever happens again there are other sites to order from online i do n't want it to be too much work to browse and study '' the copy i feel a bit cheated
the training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well i just do n't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training it is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks it does n't train you how to house train a puppy it also does n't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd the dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips luckily you can skip these i personally would not recommend this but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning else i did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals i was able to teach my blue healer pup abby to sit lay down come and heel in about 3 tries each i liked the techniques but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd
i thought this video was a cesar milan dog whisperer video i was linked to it by the amazon suggestions on the cesar milan book page very disappointing
i searched out cezar millan and got his tv show and it was paired with this dvd the author was only listed ad dog wisperer very disapointed at amazon for this type of pairing
i did a search for cesar milan known on tv as the dog whisperer and a number of items came up including this one for author it just says by dog whisperer '' well this is n't by cesar at all it 's a complete piece of junk do n't buy this
the writers used the character names and the book name but nothing else the explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous the art work of the robots was good will smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon i robot is part of a series of asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters the human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity none of this appeared in the movie
this is a terrible missues of one of asimovs greatest novels the relevance to the novel is only marginal will smith is as usual doing a terrible job at being an action hero he should have stayed with the
2.5 stars first time director steve pink has written the screenplay for two wonderful films high fidelity and grosse point blank so as a director i would imagine that he would have to read the script before deciding to make a film either he had a case of blindness the day he read the script or he did n't read it at all also he did n't take the time to research writers adam cooper and bill collage who while still relatively new to the game hav been responsible for one of the worst films of the decade 2004 's olsen disaster new york minute being said accepted is n't the worst film of the decade nor is it even remotely in the worst films of the year category rather accepted is a seriously ambitious film with a plot as thin as nicole richie on a fad diet '' to quote richard roeper that statement could n't be more on the money to retread other reviewers at the beginning of the film sherman schrader played by jonah hill whose thirty second role in the old virgin was hysterical says to main character bartleby gaines justin long of such bad films as herbie fully loaded and waiting this will never work '' and it wo n't there are holes in every part of the film 's design none of this will ever work it 's impossible so then i pose the question why make a film out of a plot that would in no way shape or form ever work and please do n't answer my question with some stock answer like well it 's escapism it does n't need to work '' which may be true in some cases if the screenplay is written properly accepted 's is not every character with one exception more on him later is a complete stock character drawn from every movie ever made bartleby is the slacker type who done right see ferris bueller can actually be funny there is schrader the fat kid that gets picked on and in this film made to dress like a sperm a hot dog and scores of other things there is the tomboy or rory in this case played by maria thayer of the wonderful strangers with candy '' who nobody seems to see as a beautiful woman and she is very beautiful but as one of the guys also enter the token black guy to use terminology from not another teen movie hands played by columbus short of course no main gang '' character list would be complete without the wierd kid that nobody understands or in accepted glen adam herschman the film is also riddled with gross out humor and to keep quoting richard roeper from his review of waiting you can do gross out stuff and still be funny but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters '' so you ask why am i generously giving this film 2.5 stars if it seems like i hate it so much well accepted does have some irresistable laughs and it sort of grew on me but only because of the things it has to say about the education system in college you are required to take high cost classes that you do n't really want to take but are forced to anyway why not let kids take a numerous amount of classes to figure out what they want to do and still have it count for their degree but the way bartleby and his gang go about it is too loose for college freshmen if freshmen had as much freedom as this college allows they would be passed out every night and never actually learn anything there are more kind of commonsensical things that the film says about our seriously damaged educational system but i 'll let you discover it on your own the only thing that kept me in the theater long enough to hear some of the insights was the what had to be improvisation of the brilliant lewis black there is absolutely no way that these screenwriters could have written such brilliant rants and raves it had to have been improvised and besides if you have listened or seen any of black 's shows his dialogue sounds much like his philosophies black plays ben lewis aptly named dean lewis schrader 's uncle who used to be a college dean and now works in a shoe store it is n't long and lewis is fired and helps in bartleby gang 's plot to start a college with all of this information i leave the decision to you weigh heavily the points i have outlined and determine if you want to spend nine or ten dollars to see this in the theater or if it might be better to wait for it to come out on dvd i ca n't really lean either way this is definitely a personal taste film

be careful with this video if you have any neck back or shoulder problems
i wanted this dvd to help me with grooming my poodles but that was a you need help with bathing your doggie this is the dvd to purchase if you want cutting instructions there are some but nothing that will help a novice rating this is an overpriced bit of nothing
i was hoping for a beginning lesson on grooming my dog just the basics this is more styling and tips for those who are already using grooming tools and know what to do this would be useful for someone wanting to improve their grooming skills but not very useful for a beginner
i came here to amazon recently intending to buy this dvd boxed set as i love murder she wrote and would like to be able to stop missing episodes when they are aired on television after reading all of the comments about the poor dvd quality i decided instead to check this second season out from my local library before purchasing it aaargh ! my favorite episode is keep the home fries burning '' and i could n't even watch the entire show before the dvd froze up i tried wiping the disc off several times with a flannel cloth but that did no good whatsoever i also tried past the glitch but i could n't then i tried selecting the scene after the problem place but the disc froze there too and i could not move from the scene selection page here 's something strange ! my son belongs to a well known rental company and he ordered one of the msw discs for me as a surprise it came yesterday the company only allows you so many dvd discs out at a time depending on your rental plan well the disc they sent is one of six not three as in the box set and it is not a dvd ! i 'm wondering if maybe universal made these discs especially for this company everything else on the dvds looks the same only they are not the disc my son rented for me was from the first season and it played beautifully i guess i 'll just keep renting these discs from this company without purchasing the boxed sets i do n't understand why the discs are n't being sold in the boxed sets murder she wrote is a wonderful and delightful program and one i always enjoy watching i hope this dvd quality problem is fixed soon as i would still love to own these sets
i bought this for my mom who enjoyed the series and i found that i actually enjoyed it also the one problem and a big one is that the dvds are defective i tried playing them on three different players and the results were the same the pixels were messed up on several of the shows and in two cases stopped playing altogether a couple of the shows could not be watched to the end because they would start and stop and then eventually stop completely returning the item is too much of a headache so we decided to let it go i also purchased seasons 1 and 3 for her and have no such problems one i believe i purchased through amazon and the other elsewhere we just decided we will be purchasing no more boxed sets in this series
i was a real fan of the series when it originally aired and have continued watching it in reruns on cable stations i purchased the first season at a local discount store so when i found the second season on amazon i jumped at the chance to buy it i still enjoy the program but the quality of these dvd 's is questionable very often while viewing them the picture is scrambled similar to a bad satellite signal this greatly reduces my plesaure in viewing the dvd 's so much so that if i could easily return them i would
once again universal gives a good tv show a terrible release on dvd as with their other tv shows and now some of their movies the picture and sound have improved but there are no bonus features in some cases the shows were cut and paste edited some of the music was changed and the dvd 's still freeze frame in the middle of the show and the dvd player unfreezes the frame by going back to the show 's opening titles what gives ! i have seen bare bones releases and second rate dvd 's releases from other companies most notely with disney and warners but universal also is rapidly joining the list of companies that corner the market with bad and defective dvd standards all i can do is stop watching tv shows or movies made by universal because now it is more then likely that they will give them bad dvd releases that are not worth my time or money
the disks in this set are double sided and there are problems one or two of the episodes are unreadable we returned the first set which had an entire unreadable side on one of the cd 's the replacement was better but not perfect the single sided cd 's in other sets are much better and highly reliable as to quality double sided just have built in flaws and i wish they would discontinue them
what is the deal cant hollywood leave well enough alone how many classic animated movies are they going to ruin with sequels let me think their was balto 2 little mermaid 2 aladdin 2 and three secret of nimh 2 land before time etc enough already next thing you know they 'll be making a lion king 2 and a buity and the beast 2. o wait they already did that did n't they all the movies i have named were great originals but god awful sequels adgth 2 is just as bad if you loved the original stay away from its sequal
what do you get well a lawsuit for plagiarism but that is n't what i 'm going to talk about here the island started pretty well production design was great the story was intriguing very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society ' i thought michael bay was going to surprise me the product placement was irritating and cheesy but i could live with it while the writing was pretty corny it was still nice to see michael bay trying something a little different for him something smarter but once our heroes escape the movie nosedives it felt like two completely different movies were tacked together as i said i was enjoying the beginning the survivors of an unspecified contamination '' dwell within a sterile city their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge they are watched over and coddled they have no real concerns they live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner which promises them a trip to the island the last uncontaminated place on earth once you discover the truth the rest of the movie degrades to car and foot chases explosions shattered glass and twisted metal and lots of running and yelling fill out the last hour and a half or so i 'm all for action movies loved die hard and many schwarzenegger movies it 's that the action seemed so out of place with this particular story it seems to me that if i was the head of a company and its ' future was up in the air because some damaging information was stolen i would n't think that the best solution would be to send a heavily armed militia through crowded downtown los angeles to retrieve it for the story that was being told some hitchcock style suspense would have worked much better like i said the start was promising then the movie switched gears after about an hour i was just wishing the movie would end already i 've read that this is michael bay 's best movie yet that may be but it sure does n't say much for him as a director i 've just found out that this movie was plagiarized from 'the clonus horror ' that one got the treatment but i 'm betting that i 'll still enjoy it more than this movie
you have this film has been compared to logan 's run '' the matrix '' and coma '' to name a few but it most strongly resembles 1979 b movie parts the clonus horror '' probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mystery science theater 3000 '' sitting through the island '' i kept thinking to myself boy this looks familiar '' in fact the island '' is almost a complete clone ba da ching ! of parts '' right down to the outfits worn by the clones there is currently a lawsuit against bay brought by the makers of parts '' which should be an case this film is set in a futuristic clone colonie where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts the clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility 's employees not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise the island of course the clones allegedly going to the island are actually being euthanized for their organs their patrons having gotten sick the movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise ewan mcgregor is satisfactory in this role his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge his female counterpart scarlet johansen is pure eye candy a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead or even a major part in a college play the best performance is turned in by sean bean the evil there is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie but it is not only nothing special it is nothing original maybe worth a rental but not much more
this movie is one of cinema history 's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success saturday night fever '' from a few years before is another example but that movie could actually stand on its own jennifer beales ' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside i do n't think this one could i understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80 's children and i will agree this is one of the great soundtracks of cinema the problem is the movie 's plot is a wasted opportunity physically beales is sexy enough to keep your attention and her portrayal of girl in a man 's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made but her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character come to think of it the acting all around is a bit weak but that 's not the problem the movie suffers from two fatal the first is the plot itself depictions aside it 's pretty simplistic unimaginative stuff even for a dance movie what 's worse is how slow it all moves the drama sequences dances drag on straining your patience and sympathy for the character 's plights the other more tragic flaw since it is a movie about dance is the cinematography while it 's certainly not the worst cinematography ever check out the limey '' next time you want a headache the dance sequences look like they 've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor we 're supposed to be moved by beales ' character 's natural talent but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits by the time the final dance scene finally comes along the drama of her audition performance is ruined by bad editing it almost seems the judges let her into juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute perhaps i 'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than editing but if it 's a movie about dancing one would think the least they could do is show dancing many movies before and after flashdance managed to get this right saturday night fever '' certainly did to its great success but maybe nobody told this movie 's director it 's a shame
believe it or not i actually wanted to watch this movie i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts i watched 's because i remembered an intriguing preview on a vhs cassette i watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on sealed the deal my girlfriend owns a copy of lyne 's version of was a girlfriend induced rental i watched the tv version of i have n't seen but i read the book flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you 've never seen it and i always wanted to hear the song maniac '' in its original context so when i found it on an acquaintances shelf i popped it in so how was it not too bad not great by any means or even really that good and 's are both quite good but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work the plot is a believe in your dreams '' story with really lame dialog but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like i was watching an abstract silent film i do n't know squat about dancing but the choreography seemed innovative at least for its time i ca n't even remember the names of the characters but all in all i have to admit that it was kind of neat also if you watch it with the subsequent years of movies in mind can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from hollywood it 's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack joe esterhasz and was produced by jerry bruckheimer ! taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60 of all crap movies made since
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then
many of the reviews i read felt strongly in favor of this remake but some of the people had not seen an affair to remember '' cary grant deborah kerr had the spark so lacking in this love affair '' remake the original love affair '' with forgive me i can only remember irene dunne as terry and my opinion that film was not as good as this love affair '' however i missed hearing the original scoring of an affair to remember '' but annette benning 's music with the children was lovely as most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of an affair '' i missed the climactic ending with cary grant 's reactions and also the shipboard scene where he want 's to be worthy of her love '' i do n't wish to underrate or dump '' on this film but i wish all reviewers would watch the version just once i believe they will become old movie buffs '' too thanks for reading my review
this is a remake of an affair to remember with cary grant and deborah and it does not work some movies just should not be remade the only thing good about this movie is katharine hepburn 's appearance get the original
first of all i am a joy division and new order fan therefore i tried to like this really i did sadly this film stinks the focus is not on the bands themselves but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life maybe i 'm not british but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny only a few scenes made me grin the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film in addition the camera work was very jerky looked like it was done by a novice and yes i 'm one myself having made two movies the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division too bad the members of this band are minor characters i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much much better
do n't let the cover fool you this film is n't half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it 's my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove '' or at least something interesting to watch and it 's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i would n't call this bad it had it 's good parts just not many
party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung if best in show was not enough that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the brit wave and michael winterbottom could have exposed the in a much better way my main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should the rise of factory i did really enjoy the joy division segments though even if exploiting ian curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste unless you 're a fan of the brit explosion of the era and an extreme fan at that i could not recommend this film it 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into
talentless people and garbage music torture you in this no time flat you 'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' out into the not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich do we wait until then to change the moral that 's pathetic and so is this movie
man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs old but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wan na cr
i 'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick '' dick '' is funny this is not i 'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst or that level of indefatigable cuteness just go rent dick '' instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country
incredible does describe this incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi '' or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she 's only worthy of miss congeniality '' type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
this film got one star for the scenery of the 135 minutes it was 130 minutes to long and of wasted time do n't waste your time with this one
i went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of northern america having only really seen pocahontas through the eyes of disney i felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events like other reviewers i found the photography and the scenery to be simply stunning visually the film wows the viewer the scenes simply amaze with their beauty the sets with their majesty and also rustic simplicity coupled with the musical score this was some of the best camera work i have seen in a long time this was in my opinion the sole redeeming feature of the film while the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love allegiance and so on it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration in one part the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened for actors of the calibre of colin farrell and christian bale this film did not show them at their best certainly not the worst i have seen by any stretch but definitely not the best i have seen from either one of these actors tread with caution on this one and hire it before you buy it i am glad i did not spend good money purchasing it quite frankly it is a great cure for insomnia
the new world is the least of terrence malick 's limited filmography to date and could be best described as a monotone poem it 's not exactly bad just mundane and rather forgettable even while you 're watching it more of a than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions against selections from his classical music collection which does n't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific colin farrell a nice enough lad offscreen i 'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just can not carry a picture no matter how many chances he 's given true to form he trots out his two picture ' expressions the one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he 's not been getting enough roughage in his diet the fact that he 's outshone by q'orianka kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy although to be fair he has been worse indeed among the male leads christian bale does much much more with much much less in the last third of the film as does a typically underused christopher plummer in the first third malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of jamestown but because it happens to people we 've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight if anything it just made me think of how much more herzog could have made of it all moments work most notably the expulsion of the ' from their land and the brief latter sequences in england but on the evidence of the version i very much doubt malick 's promised longer cut will solve the problems i know it 's meant to be a work of art but i just came away with the feeling that i 'd watched an old and very average universal international western redubbed by philosophy students the only surprise was that jeff chandler and his bouncing basques did n't crop up
me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films and we do really like the thin red line but this was a real boring piece of film making whole film was just one huge poetry reading and i prefer to read poetry from a book just does n't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by george the battle scenes were just poetry readings thin red line instead if you are interested in this director 's work that film is a masterpiece isn't
this movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of christian bale and colin farrell to date it was boring overblown and incessantly long it 's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better but it never does and then it just ends do n't waste the time or the money
what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic maybe but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i could n't understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage 's character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex violence or rough language although cage does get shot in one scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they should n't have changed it so much or they should n't have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together
it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast nicolas cage bridget fonda and rosie perez among others the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the ny state lotto decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day the acting is surprisingly ! below average the dialogues are way below average while the plot is not bad at all nicolas cage 's character is too naive and too slow and that was just ! bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland rosie perez 's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing they do n't seem to belong subsequently they are not convincing in their roles at all finally somebody shoot the narrator '' please ! though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here if nicolas cage is what you had in mind check out the amazing movies city of angels the family man
i only wish it were possible to give them no stars or just red x 's these guys never shipped my order and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then amazon once that ship date came and went i just made a claim to get my money back a total of 2 months for dvd 's that were meant for a father 's day gift these guys are clueless stay away from them for sure you 're better off going to target to buy dvd's
i ca n't believe that people have the nerve to compare this to the oringal one with chris tucker or even the second i watched this piece of unfunny white goofball movie and wanted to cry i really peeved me off that people had the nerve to say it deserved better or claiming that people were only bashing it because it was a black film but no it was horrible and seemed to need the touch of dj pooh and a return of chris tucker to make it funny this is just a crappy movie that needed not to be made sorry cube
was i watching the same show as everyone who wrote reviews on here i just finished the season having loved the first two i was so disapointed in this season i 'm really not sure i can even give the show another chance with season 4. the show completely runied all of the characters they introduced new people who were either completely shrill and unbearable billie or bland and pointless angus and then there 's jenny the writers continued in their quest to create the most unlikeable annoying character in the history of television this is nothing against mia kirshner who is lovely and does well with what she 's given but after 3 seasons the writers still ca n't seem to figure out what to make of the character it might make more sense if she was treated as some sort of pariah by those around her but all of the other characters seem to love her so are they seeing that i 'm not her actions make no sense her relationships make no sense even for a crazy person as for the sex someone actually thought they reeled the sex in this season i never minded it in the past but sweet lord ! ! ! by the end of the season i felt like i was watching cinemax after dark ! it was insanse ! grown adults do not start pulling off their clothes and fondling each other when mother is right outside the door ! ! ! ! ! especially when mom said she would be right back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! by the end of things you are left without a single character to like a single believable storyline or any reason to want to spend time with these selfish immature unstable women ever again
i work as an editor on projects mostly commercials and music video 's with a couple of well regarded concert dvd 's and award winning short film work to my credit and i have to say that the editing on this disc and the previous 2 to a lesser extent demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material there is an epic quality to in concert each song is its own experience its own mini event and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically letting the tell its own story and what a story it is ! the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance s and the effect is that you are taken out of or at least not fully drawn into the marvelous natural flow of power that is live all 3 of these dvd 's are worth having simply because the band 's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs could have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event s what a shame
it 's terribly boring period this dvd makes me fall asleep very easily too many interviews and the video quality is really bad
i never received product as they never shipped it amazon sent me an email stating that they could n't complete my order as it was '' not sure what that means if every other item i purchase is deliverable ''
okay i 've wanted this film for a very long time so this year i finally get around to ordering it however i was n't aware that ridley scott ever put together a director 's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this dvd being the director 's cut so it gets delivered i open it up excitedly and see a box on the cover that says includes ridley scott 's director 's cut with jerry goldsmith 's score okay cool it includes the director 's cut that implies that both the theatrical release and the director 's cut are on the disc not so this is only the director 's cut and to be honest it 's not all that great and goldsmith 's score is not one of his better ones i was wanting the theatrical release with that wonderful score by tangerine dream the version i remember seeing so many years ago so now i have to shell out the money for the ultimate edition which has both versions on it if amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which i feel about as shafted as when i bought the exorcist '' on dvd only to get the version you 've never seen which was equally lame
in school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature to me that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a book within two measly paragraphs that feeling is exactly my reaction to ridley scott 's overly produced and underly executed film legend throughout the film i felt that scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than the neverending story and lord of the rings put together i felt this way because fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade i was waiting for a stronger outing of willow but instead i saw legend disintegrate right before my eyes it was as if ridley had pages of material but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs what ultimately happened was that we the viewer were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals creative lands and mythical creatures we were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on curry 's price of darkness '' portrayal and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement legend in my eyes begins with an unsettling bang '' we see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of creatures alas immediately after pulling at our dark sides he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the princess lilly and her jack played by mia sara and tom cruise respectively caught between horrid writing unfamiliar past experiences and a the size of kansas on cruise 's face we are left with nothing to do except wait with the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future we wait the unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that scott never recreates it for us legend fails not just because of the shallow acting but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film while this critic blames ridley 's choice of sara and cruise as our guides i do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping i felt trapped throughout this story as if the walls that contained princess lilly were the actual boundaries of the film this hurt legend unlike other fantasy films of this nature the walls of a structure may encase our hero but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet with legend i never felt that i felt as if scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination i needed maybe even wanted to see more of this planet scott created but the door was shut abruptly in my face i would like to state again that i thought scott had good intentions with this film but the final result either from its original bad screenings to the infamous director 's cut '' just did n't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie scott had some i stress some '' moment of excitement moments of imagination and moments of sheer fantasy but they were all clouded by the brazen push of melodrama and visions what makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters in legend the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters cruise 's portrayal of jack could have been done by anyone who passed acting 101 while curry does give the best performance of the film it is another case of '' without the horns or the bold eyes anyone could have been underneath the mask curry did great but take him out of the costume and ask the question does he follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more than original and the final result is an legend i wanted to like this film i knew about the status of scott 's fantasy attempt but in the end i felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture overall i can not recommend a second viewing to this film i went in expecting a willow or neverending story or at least enough darkness to counter alien or blade runner but instead finished the film thinking that in today 's standards this would have counted as a direct to video '' release scott as well as his brother are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema but legend failed legend failed because of the story as well as the acting both were not in place therefore both could not work together during the commentary scott mentions his passion for cocteau 's beauty and the beast but it was obvious that he was just to gain film critic 's respect legend if anything insults cocteau 's masterpiece from the wrongly used word of the title not a legend but a to cruise 's to the cheaply forgettable ending legend did n't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand grade out of
this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking these really make the movie crawl one minute there 's action next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism seriously these little talks take up of the movie the visuals are awesome no question about that even so they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story altogether not much actually happens during the movie if you must see it rent it first to be sure you want it
before i review i 'd like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name which i have not read so i do n't know which is more accurate but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i do n't like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that 's the biggest problem there 's not really enough story to last a feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short and since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes there are barely any and they are n't very impressive for the most part they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60 of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing or a woman 's nipples that 's not cinematic artistry that 's being either lazy or perverted the animation itself is n't even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago it 's choppy and there 's not really a whole lot of detail except when it comes to women 's nipples looking at just the animation if i did n't know better i 'd have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980 's the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it 's probably kind of like how i did n't see the 1989 batman movie until years after i 'd been spoiled by batman the animated series and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you 're you 're at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you 'll find a lot to love but i ca n't say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex
i read other reviews about the poor disk quality but thought i 'd get luckly which i did n't the very first episode skipped and finally stopped altogether near the end i tried it on 2 different players with the same result cheap double sided dvds i expect more of the same on the other episodes a great show treated shabbily with cheap disks if you have n't bought hart to hart yet get that instead
my second disc side one skips pauses rolls back tell me how can i right this
those who feel that the movie seems are correct which also accounts for bowie 's withholding of any of his songs for use in the film those who think the script is merely fiction with composite characters are sadly mistaken the elaborate sets for the film are interesting the music is good excepting the obvious lack of bowie but almost everything else is awful velvet goldmine 's script is based on notorious scandal monger and slimeball tony zanetta 's sophomoric and out of print '' book from his brief time working for mainman bowie 's first professional production company zanetta 's book stardust the david bowie story '' is in the grand tradition of exploitative vendetta books written by former employees of succesful artists it 's a shame that the producers and director were able to use even a single bowie song for the use as the film 's title
the refrain it 's not about bowie '' may be true in a way but watching the dvd and then reading the reviews below it 's clear why a lot of real bowie haters seem to love this picture the sneering review entitled citizen bowie '' for example refers to him this way lots of mediocre songs even ziggy had its clunkers eventually the artist must stop living the myth and do the work '' oh really i just read cameron crowe 's article all access bowie '' covering bowie 's period in the special issue of rolling stone and the man was described as a brilliant and hypercharged workaholic hearing his albums in the very early seventies on underground fm radio it can not be overstated bowie was first and foremost a musical phenomenon not a visual one we were blown away that the same person could write such widely diverse and highly acclaimed material as lp 's like man of words man of music the man who sold the world hunky dory ziggy stardust and aladdin sane in fact most especially in who liked him in the earliest period did so in spite of not because of the androgony and glam '' context you have to be pretty thick not to see slade as the bowie character this movie feels like a vendetta against even though clearly the main characters all have aspects that are composites there are some who have written that film director haynes ' anger is attributable to the fact that bowie did not allow his music to be used in this mess of a movie this seems plausible but what is most telling is that the untalented and vengeful angela bowie loved it this film has its moments visually but is mostly way off the mark
it 's 1984 10 years since glam rock star brian slade jonathan rhys meyers staged his own death and effectively disappeared from the public eye to mark the anniversary of this event arthur stuart christian bale a youngish newspaper reporter is assigned the story whatever happened to brian slade '' stuart was a devout fan of slade in the like others of his generation he fed off of slade 's image and saw hope in the musician 's freedom of sexuality and personal expression at first stuart is reluctant to revisit slade 's and his own past but before long he is interviewing slade 's former manager wife and lover alla citizen kane and piecing together the truth behind the elusive icon it is no secret that the character of slade is based on musician david bowie and that ewen mcgregor 's character is based on iggy pop the same music the same outfits the same hair very similar stories but the slade character seems to have been equally derived from author oscar wilde who is referenced several times in the film both seem to espouse the concept of art for art 's sake and live lives of aesthetic decadence hell when slade speaks which he rarely does he speaks primarily in oscar wilde quotes ! as the film delves deeper into the story of brian slade his career and the people he inspired it addresses the concepts of art desire image and reality pretty interesting right well wrong to begin with for me velvet goldmine was simply a boring film with all those bare butts orgies and men in makeup you 'd think i would be riveted but i was n't i think i was bored because the characters are boring aside from slade 's wife played by the ever wonderful toni collette they are all dull and thoughtless not unkind but literally there are no thoughts in their heads driven entirely be greed and lust i also felt the film was entirely too disjointed okay i understand that it 's got to cut from present to past given the concept a reporter piecing together facts from years ago no problem but the constant jumps in time the manic editing the shifting from reality to surrealism it made the movie unnecessarily confusing and frustrating to watch and lastly i was somewhat angered by the slade character he rarely speaks he always has an empty though lustful look in his eyes and he seems to care very little for his music as he is all about the fame i know that this movie is fiction and that brian slade is not david bowie but if you are going to borrow that heavily from a real life man i think you owe him a bit of credit though undeniably mindful of his image david bowie was a musician first hunky dory ziggy stardust aladdin sane his music could absolutely stand on its own without the platform boots and leotards ! moreover david bowie is far more intelligent warm charming and than the despicable brian slade in conclusion though velvet goldmine is ambitious and potentially interesting in my opinion it winds up being a flat messy unfair and soulless film i would have given it 1 star but i have to give it props for the music and costuming
it 's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film how could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy if this film is considered groundbreaking then i fear for our republic
i 've never given one star to any type of produce before but the stupidity of this dvd and its fans are shocking so revealing ! so true ! if you did n't know fast food was unhealthy give me a break if you think this is realistic give me a break supersize me '' is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating mcdonalds food the film documents morgan spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of mcdonalds per day this diet has rules too whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be he must do it he also much try each item on the menu at least once he is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu the thing is though if he is really trying to make a valid point why does he order the double quarter pounder with cheese meal twice within the first seven days this is questionable because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all the thing is though millions of people some skinner than spurlock have this meal and do not throw up why him his wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet so why would he choose the biggest item on the menu twice in the first week there are many many other items that he could n't possibly been able to cover not only that he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment saying that the average american gets little exercise his laziness seems to be an exaggeration there is some merit to the movie showing people how unhealthy mcdonalds is but everyone knows that they just do n't care for spurlock to in any way even the subtlest of ways to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese is ludicrous it should be mentioned that wendy 's regular hamburger is a quarter pounder while mcdonalds regular burger is of a pound also wendy 's goes up to a triple quarter pounder something mcdonalds has never done burger king introduced the triple cheese burger and quadrouple cheese burger something mcdonalds has never done it seems that mcdonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular this movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid if the movie did n't suggest that the corporation does n't care about it 's customers i would n't have a problem but it does too much of anything especially food is bad for someone if anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy they clearly are seeing the world through a filter
i was looking forward to a special edition of this wonderful film but this new release is all a disappointment to me i have just bought the german release of it the picture is not as clear and sharp as it could or should be but mainly the image is extremely cropped ! parts of the heads and legs and that with a dancing movie ! ! ! are cut off all the time it 's a shame ! ! ! only 1 star for the dvd the film would deserve at least 3
yes indeed ! the booklet included is nice and glossy thanks ! and the two documentaries added this time around are nice too thanks again ! but what about the film itself has that been given the deluxe treatment as well sad answer definitely not ! as a matter of fact this new '' looks much worse than the previous dvd that one was a very fuzzy mess but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy in fact when i put the old one in the zoom mode there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever and the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition but worst of all is that the new dvd is cropped on all four sides ! there is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc especially on top of the frame ! so much for a deluxe edition ! shame on you ! fans of this film myself included will have to keep the old dvd and get this new one for the extras and the booklet the 2 stars above are for those inclusions alone this is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film
if this movie was ever going to have a chance it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just ca n't be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just was n't time enough i guess to develop the characters or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating and we are left with painful stereotypes and in the case of roland michell a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you 've read the book skip the movie but if you saw the movie you should do yourself a favor and get the book
am i the only one who found the basic workout difficult the pace was too quick for me to get the right technique in the poses and even though i have done this workout several times now my back almost always is very painful for at least 24 hours afterward i have found that apart from a few exercises the intermediate workout is easier
i 'm not a civil war scholar so i 'll defer to reviewers with greater knowledge about the accuracy of what is portrayed in the film as a film however this one is lacking in many ways from to noticeably poor editing when combined with inaccurate history the disappointment is doubled andersonville was directed by john frankenheimer who created many good or great films one of which the manchurian candidate is a masterpiece with his resume i have to believe that the intentions of the were good but the end product a movie reflects an inferior medium a story as naturally powerful and important as andersonville deserves a greater commitment to realism and the drama should have been derived from historically accurate fact instead the drama was manufactured history was dramatized it 's a film that deserves to be made again by someone with a commitment to accuracy and produced by a company more interested in the best available version of the truth than in pandering to an audience of supposed dullards with pap when stories like andersonville are not told with excellence the fall into mediocrity is precipitous and leaves me feeling that the story should not have been filmed at all
this movies rates right up there with schindler 's list '' in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg '' and the even better gods and generals '' if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence aka the civil war watch gods and generals '' or gone with the wind '' and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville '' also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals '' coming for the christmas season of 2005
i will not watch the movie andersonville '' until they make a movie called elmira '' the camp in elmira the worst of the union prison camps had 35 death rate
are you a woman who believes that every guy is a jerk adulterer or potential murderer then short cuts is for you you can sit back and reinforce your prejudices yelling right on ! '' at the screen every two minutes what we have here is not a collection of short stories so much as a collection of drunks cheats killers and insensitive morons one wonders if robert altmand and raymond carver would dare show up at a corner bar frequented by mostly guys real guys not wimps and losers i think they might seriously be razzed by an angry mob in such a situation and should best stay clear however perhaps positive reinforcement for their artist endeavors might come from women 's lib soirees and liberal cocktail gatherings where such negative opinions about men are probably offered quite often and agreed upon without debate the collection of actors in short cuts is impressive and they do excellent work jack lemmon tim robbins andie macdowell julianne moore and frances mcdormand among others for that i give it two stars otherwise short cuts is a sickening session not worth wasting your time on unless of course you are a female who thinks all men
short cuts robert altman 1992 there 's a chap you may have heard of by the name of joe frank he does wonderful hysterically strange radio dramas that will leave you in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters therein frank is a master at what he does there 's another chap you may have heard of by the name of raymond carver he wrote wonderful hysterically strange short stories and the occasional poem that will leave you in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters within carver too was a master at what he did then there is robert altman who decided to take a number of the short stories in carver 's watershed book cathedral and turn them into a film the result is short cuts it is neither wonderful nor hysterically strange and while it has echoes of both the carver stories on which it is based and the ludicrous extremes of joe frank it can not claim to achieve the mastery of either of them i mention joe frank because there are certain scenes in the movie the occasional moment that remind me of frank 's work altman is capable of achieving with visual techniques what frank achieves with his dialogue the ability to make the viewer wonder what sort of insane mind could possibly put this sort of thing together but where frank does it on a constant basis these moments are all too rare in short cuts the rest of this far far too long flick consists of a number of very very good actors going through their paces in a stangely listless manor talking a lot and not actually doing all that much there are a few very good performances jack lemmon in a small role stands out but the net effect of putting together this many fantastic actors in one film is to dilute the whole even if everyone here gave performances however it still would n't help the movie just wanders never settling on a single storyline long enough to do it justice the obvious comparison here is to pulp fiction which does that trick so well cutting from storyline to storyline as fast and loose as romero 's dawn of the dead cuts between camera angles while some of this movie is undeniably fascinating and it 's competently put together it could have been so much better than it actually is
michael moore filmed this propaganda partially financed by the united auto workers to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion made possible by gm 's unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings years of losses at gm have shown moore 's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain all of gm 's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross slow redesign cycles lack of money for research you name it moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice they find the better value in asian autos nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a documentary ''
what a joke people believe the stupidest things do some research and you will see that this is a joke i hated it
i gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap '' it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore but choose not to one the other hand rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone watch the nightly news now last night march 2006 gm offered a one time buy out to some of it 's employees the news reported that gm can not afford to maintain its relationship with the uaw just like what caused the flint situation in the film this same thing happened in the late 1980 's and brought forth this extremely biased movie this film is entertaining in a strange way but should not be considered to be the absolute truth watch it with a grain of salt for what it 's worth under close examination careful consideration and keen intellect you will see a undercover message you might need to examine closely the content outwardly things are not what they seem until you look more closely many times the basic concept is misread in the dialog once you see this and open your mind to it rational thought will emerge
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here crash '' comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world '' my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here 's a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i do n't like any of these people so their pain does n't mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would 've worked but now there just is n't anything there as far as what 's actually in the movie we 've got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we 've got jared 's mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto 's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there 's no real attempt to make wayans into a person he 's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that 's it the doubly sad fact is that he 's the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it 's a wonder that the smack does n't cause them to cease to exist entirely well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually the bergman films i 've seen so that 's not really a fair comparison they love each other apparently but since i do n't even like either of them i 'm not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it would n't have been funny if i cared about her but we 've been over that and i want you people to know that i 'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie 's dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting '' which has characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba '' a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream '' so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that 's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream '' is n't helped any by darren aronofsky 's repetitive derivative the trouble is this movie has n't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they 're hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see a thousand times montages a million times and plenty of wonky junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai n't drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that does n't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky was n't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters were n't going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that 's a good ending grade ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows
i give this film one star for the acting which is often very good however the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness and debase every aspect of lower income urban people in all honesty i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film against my better judgement still if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty then i recommend a streetcar named desire '' kids '' last exit to brooklyn '' and traffic ''
though well made the movie is manipulative really leaving more questions than answers the narrator is extremely vague certain people '' they '' among other euphemisms refuses to include other points of view making it ipso facto propaganda and plays more on the viewer 's emotions than anything else part of it is a immigration manifesto the actual phrasing of the geneva convention is manipulated too in the actual document it says that only those who fight under a uniform are entitled to it 's protections the documentary claims that all people are regarldess overall it 's basically a documentary with some a few valid points but overall just propaganda
having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i ca n't fathom the entire plot is shallow and unrealistic i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i do n't condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it and it does n't mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you ca n't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it 's not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that would n't bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself
i get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide ! the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! ! it is not matching the character
i have n't seen a movie so since the contender they did n't even try to make good arguments for the side i hate to use the term liberal bias but in this case it fits like a glove the cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie i felt like the gun companies were the underdogs pure garbage
i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars this movie is nothing but propaganda i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this but it was like watching a train wreck i just had to stay for the end you know for those of you who do n't know firearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year and mine was one of them this movie cd might make a good coaster but beyond that it is trash some less than truthful nra member '' yeah right wrote '' i really liked and enjoyed this movie the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention it will keep yours too just give it a chance sure it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry but they deserve it and need to be more responsible i may buy the dvd to watch it again but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from and not gotten around to watching however i may add this to my collection ! '' horse hockey member of the nra more like member of the micheal moore fan club this was the worst movie i have ever seen they even had to lie to get you in the theater as nothing was mentioned about it being in the trailers ! and saying that it was a little bit slanted '' is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie ! !
never have i seen a movie violate a book so badly john grisham 's runaway jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction in which the widow of a smoker takes on big tobacco in the courtroom the movie runaway jury is a suspense chase in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers this movie is at most a caricature of the book and not a flattering one at that hackman transforms fitch 's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall parts of marlee 's past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events the most interesting aspects of the story jury selection and nicholas easter 's manipulation of the court are grudgingly presented in montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around if i had never read the book i would consider this a flick at best but knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad even if you are n't a lover of fiction i highly recommend buying the book instead
stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic not one single fact '' about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film i had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won what a crock
i agree with david thomson when he says few audiences in the west would be content to view an american epic composed solely of battles and their contexts kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the west was entrenched with kagemusha '' and ran '' he knew what american audiences think of as heroic and mystical about historical '' japan kurosawa 's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what americans or westerners imagine about japan he was not popular in japan where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded hence the suicide attempt i am not saying that the work is rubbish there is no ugly '' shot in either ran '' or kag '' merely that there are more authentically japanese '' films out there to choose from
by the time you see the ending you 'll already be wishing that you had n't watched this movie
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich do we wait until then to change the moral that 's pathetic and so is this movie
man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs old but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wan na cr
the subject matter being an intrnet porn star 's life it is not a movie it is cheap explotation this piec of trash looks like it was shot using a cheap ditiga camera and lousy editing skills that 's all the internet is good for is porn not surpriseingly it was never given a theater release i think even if the mpaa had rated it it would have been how about rated t for trash

this review refers to the uncut dvd version like the other reviewers here i loved this movie the movie i would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress juliette marquis from ukraine no less the image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video i can undertand and accept that this dvd however is a lousy pan and scan version some movies can be pan and scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future tv transfers in mind but this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and did n't make room for transfer to fullscreen tv it is intensely frustrating to watch this damned dvd you watch noses talking to half faces half faces talking to ears heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly i am furious at the studio at hart sharp video who sanctioned this pan and scan monstrosity and they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen to add insult to injury they show pictures on the back cover and the insert of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the pan and scan cropped crap hart sharp video goes straight to my list of never buy from again by all means see this movie at the theater or wait till a more responsible company releases a new dvd edition
i can just imagine the writer 's '' let 's see we 've got massive tornados in tidal wave engulfing nyc an almost immediate that kills instantly and a sick character who needs medication or she will die what could make this better wolves ! yes we need escaped wolves '' sheesh if anyone thinks the cgi effects in this movie are fabulous they 've obviously never seen a real wolf those things were n't even close oh and let 's not forget the zoo that keeps the bears sheep and wolves right next to each other in a small building riiight i spent most of the movie either laughing at the absurdity of the scenario and getting nauseated by the sentimental '' scenes i 'm not even going to go into the horrible plot cliches galore and all of the other just plain wrong things about this movie i 'm not going to touch on the overt environmental and political messages that probably did more damage to real and important climate concerns since from the reviews it seems some people actually believed this was even remotely plausible while others used it to deepen their hatred of greenies '' do n't waste your time with this one there are far better movies of this genre and there are far better ways to learn about global warming
i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down '' try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !
i could n't get into this movie it was boring too long and i could n't wait for it to be over with george was annoying and he should 've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo the only thing i liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning
who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters this movie was somewhat good but it did n't feel all that great so far this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra the incredible hulk xmen 3 daredevil and the punisher i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies but after seeing what hollywood does to them i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding special effects were good in this movie and so was the story michael chiklis as the thing was great and his the thing character makeup was done very well and he played the character well too as did ioan gruffud with fantastic jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie
what 's with all the titles using the word fantastic wow that 's so original ! did you write that yourself anyway i was disappointed with this one like many others here i thought it was a big waste of time and talent i would have liked to have more of a set up and some type of comarardarie between the fantastic four but this slack was garbage i would not rent or purchase this movie mc white said not f darn it i almost did the same thing
films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag while never my favorite genre the stakes have been raised in recent years with sophisticated outings such as batman begins '' 2 '' and spiderman 2 '' and superman returns '' it seems that we 've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art these films surprised me and entertained me as any movie should but also utilized real drama intelligence and adult sensibilities often with great performances and smart logical scripts even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films so the fantastic four '' is a throwback far from sophisticated it plays as a live action cartoon that might be ok but the more pressing problem is that it 's not particularly fun either i know a lot of people feel that the incredibles '' borrowed heavily from the fantastic four '' concept and maybe so but at least on film the incredibles '' was rousing entertainment maybe the film fantastic four '' should have taken that cue i wo n't blame the actors i actually like many of them in other roles it 's a lackluster sloppy script the filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows first and foremost they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience kiddies included and i can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from the human torch and the thing their interactions after all are the equivalent of junior high taunting but it 's just not funny enough the effects are n't original enough and it sure lacks a brain put the small kids in front of it it 's harmless enough but you probably do n't want to invest your time with the fantastic four ''
the central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920 's robin hood and his band of gangsters unfortunately even the rat pack can not save this movie the script is slow dated and dull barbara rush 's scenes are especially confusing her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie nothing comes of her apparent interest in sinatra or martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut the main actors seemed to be bored and with the exceptions of bing crosby and peter falk walked through their performances maybe they were hung over most of the time save your money and borrow it from your local library
one more movie plaguiarising the matrix hence it 's again mainly matrix fight scenes mimicing matrix trying to be the matrix dooming what should be a most original cinema experience to the worst failure of studio for commercialism as soon as i watched the game scenes 'reminiscence ' i took a breath and said that 's it where was it
this movie was so awful what a waste of money i love johnny depp but this is sooo bad it is overplayed to the point where it 's just dumb it was really boring as well with no plot really really bad acting and overplayed

the only reason why i saw this was because of susannah york this shows she was more capable of the dix she played in the killing of sister george '' and was a fine actress otherwise this movie is blah it 's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting the men in this movie are so disgusting one ca n't blame her for getting mad anyway for another pointless film of this caliber see secret ceremony
i copied and pasted the bottom of this from another reviewer here i have not seen this dvd but thanks to this person for not wasting my money for some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do not get it ! we fans do not want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd ! ! who pray tell when they are at a concert in person spends a bunch of time looking around the fans and not the show get it yet doh ! simple ! keep the cameras on the show ! and dont change from one camera to another every 5 seconds ! that pisses me off too to no end learn this watch roger waters dvd in the flesh learn learn learn ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although ned o'hanlon said in an interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the boston show the spirit of the entire show is captured very well shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm
whatever ills are in the world it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided and totally movie for example instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and if they chose that job freely it must be their best option no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise as opportunities increase over time by having more corporations and not less to create more competition for these people 's labor and as the country becomes wealthier these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where labor laws at the urging of the un turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs as sad as it may be were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process but all the industrialized nations went through that process shortcuts '' usually produce results which are even worse however the results speak for themselves in very short period of time for example hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china india and around the world thanks for the evil '' capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also cost of living is very low there so these pennies really can go a long way do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people i guess to let people starve to death then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes and may act like a separate being '' as far the law in concerned but does a corporation have a nose feet stomach can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis of course not than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it several of the main spokepersons '' in the movie chomsky michael moore rifkin and others are renowned for their comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie you 're basically bombarded by arguments with very little of the other side presented despite the director 's claim of the opposite claim it 's more like 80 -20 just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes hey let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! dvd players or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need chomsky of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want according to him he says that you should do more important things '' like perhaps studying lingistics which he teaches but which very few care about the movie does make some correct and good observations especially regarding polution however i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the government do so many things for private companies with public funds just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies forbid government corporate welfare of any kind forbid subsidies to companies cut the suffocating red tape and regulation esp in developing countries but in the west too cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing give people all around the world a better life increase competition etc if these and other governments and not corporations ' problems were eliminated the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to century rural lifestile spoken about with much admiration people with no understanding about economics how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for
this documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies by law have an obligation to their stockholders rather than to society at large but this is n't the only case where 'people ' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities what about doctors when a doctor treats you by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you should n't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way should n't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you and what about accountants and lawyers every time an accountant handles someone 's money he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person 's life savings and give it to charity it 's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests what about the greater good and your lawyer should never act mainly for you each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally rather than giving special emphasis to her own client let 's get serious in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy it must first meet all obligations to others or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line as an ongoing business companies have reason to care about their reputations about earning loyalty from their employees etc yes some companies have done bad things just as some people have done bad things can every single person be condemned as a psychopath simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths corporations like people can do harmful dangerous things there 's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred but it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations just as it regulates people the example of bolivia where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater is an example of the failure of government why would the government give such rights to anyone even itself but when government regulation has been adequate privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous corporations and individuals should be regulated by governments if outrages are not detected and punished then government has failed but we should n't abolish government or corporations or people simply because none are perfect we should 1 hold governments accountable for performing their role 2 hold corporations accountable for legal violations through fines and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases as has happened many many times and 3 use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions if you really care about the poor around the world then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs on bad government
he thought the columbine incident was about gun control it was not it was about anger and bullying that is the problem that is what would have fixed that problem we need to help children be better to eachother or problems like this will keep going on it is worth seeing because it is interesting but he is wrong on this one micahel moore is a good director but people are not always right
indeed there is a need for a continuation of regulated in michael moore uses terrible examples to prove his point and humorously distorts the 's end product does not justify the moore does n't use a gun to kill he 's the very essence of the media '' did n't he do a film on pukeheads who recklessly abuse their right to own a gun that would give honest people the validation to bear arms the people he points to in the film who have done the shootings are years of watching violent images via videogames and no parental control led them to that destructive the availableness of the rifles and the bullets the eschatological preachers of the elusive doomsday like david karesch do have a right to not for holy war against the american government and pagan socialists tim mcveigh 's senseless bombing had more to do with his delusions rather than his true feelings about legal restrictions on unlimited if it was n't for the song '' happiness is a warm gun '' john lennon may not have been shot by the maniacal subliminal beatle listener mark david chapman charlton heston supports ownership of hunting rifles for sport and surprise moore attack on heston was comparing apples to shows himself as an opportunist and not a clark owns some music restaurant chain where a black woman was directed to work at is he to know about her family members possessing guns or not she broke the law and clark can not be held responsible for her domestic careless woman 's family promoted an atmosphere for their dear 's subreptitious inferences are highly entertaining but divert from the root cause of the lethal gun shootings in america
as usual michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours theres alot of great stuff here the interview w marilyn manson the interview w trey parker c but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston i agree with many nay most of moores politics but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution
moore sets out to blame guns rather than the people who make prozac and other 'designer ' seditives for the massacre at columbine high school and runs afoul of nra himself moses better known as charleton heston heston gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments moore an mostly leftist has the second amendment long live the second amendment otherwise the first amendment is gone too ! moore should wake and wise up better moore efforts that are highly mended are the big one fahrenheit roger and me and even the derrated canadian bacon
i think this dvd would be great for someone who has a lot of experience in dance it was too hard for a beginner like me she does n't give enough time for the inexperienced person to get the hang of one move before she goes on to the next one i did n't find her as annoying as some of the other reviewers did though i think it should be stated on the cover of the dvd that this is an intermediate or advanced workout
there 's so many reasons i did n't like this and am rabidly searching for someone anyone to rid me of it before i just pitch it in the trash can 's not dance it 's regular fluffy girl aerobics pretending to be dance boring instructor '' has the personality of a limp dishrag and honestly if i heard her say i wan na see your personality in this girls ! '' one more time i woulda broke my tv 's way too difficult to follow unless you are an aerobics maven i 'm only slightly over weight compared to some of my friends 147 lbs at 5 ft 4 in and i could barely get into some of the steps before galardi was spritely bouncing into something else so it 's going to send you back to the couch with some doritos if you 're like most of us out there that would need such a dvd i wish i had ignored the professional or spotlight reviews and just read the customer ones this dvd is awful !
i have jennifer 's crunch salsa dancing dvd and it was my first dance exercise dvd i loved it so much i 've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor i find the moves too difficult and frustrating by the time you are close to having one step down she 's moving onto the next one and it does n't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that i enjoy in her crunch video in that one she started out slow repepated it several times then did it real time and then added another combination the same way the end result was putting the two combinations together so basically repeating four moves over and over doing about six dance routines all together which was good enough for me when i do it now i just go right to real time and ignore the slow start so i have n't been bored at all she looks great in this video but i agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all basically i ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles but if i was a good dancer this would probably be a lot of fun
i was really excited when i saw this dvd and really deflated when i actually attempted to complete it ! the instructor gives relatively little if any instruction on how to successfully complete moves and she switches from combo to combo move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up i have also never sweated so much in my life mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration ! i am in relatively good shape i walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine in only broke my spirits ! unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer stay away ! one of the worst workouts i have ever seen
could fall asleep easily reminds me of poly sci 101 the q a session in the end is good
noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to some people have told that i dont really know what i am talking about here i can only recommend them to read what noam wrote about cuba hope to see you there noam
found this presentation very poor after reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech i was a greatly disappointed it was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like think you all know what im referring to here i suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point i give this dvd one star and read his books ! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this i ask myself how can he be an mit professor with such poor teaching skills an off ice prof
once again chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive ! it 's all america 's fault ! the evils of capitalism ! long live socialism ! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge 14.95 for it brilliant ! from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing !
you want realism of the old west try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they did n't have tissues try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black that would be realistic but it 's a lot more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity so this realistic '' show has characters with clean fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as realistic '' ! ! ! every great writer of every age and era be it mark twain owen wister william shakespeare or john steinbeck or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations told realistic '' stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in and what to leave out in order to tell the story that is why their work has remained timeless deadwood 's writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick and a juvenile one at that like profanity whether or not the calamity janes of the time actually used the words ignorant '' is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant there are an awful lot of sheeple in tv land
i 'm a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word does n't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf the stories and characters are superficial boring and unintelligent people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get whacked '' a lot
i looked forward to the first episode of deadwood '' hoping hbo would reinvent the western they way they had reinvented the mob movies with the sopranos '' about ten or fifteen minutes in i finally told myself that if one more person used a particular profanity it starts with a c and ends with sucker i was going to turn it off i did n't get that thought out before i heard it again so i shut it off i hear enough profanity in my daily life and i get plenty from movies and tv too much way too much
bob roberts is as relevant today as it was some fourteen years ago converting ideological outsiders does not seem to be its primary goal it is echo chamber entertainment meant only for the already committed leftist needless to point out this is not exactly surprising tim robbins after all who starred directed and even sang in the film is one of hollywood 's best know radical personalities to be blunt he is a less talented oliver stone the script turns conservatives into cartoon characters there is no attempt whatsoever to try understanding their world view they are simplistically portrayed as fascists seeking any excuse to justify taking over the country bob roberts tim robbins is a republican senatorial candidate hoping to defeat incumbent pennsylvanian democrat brickley paiste gore vidal he is vile and not above using dirty tricks to achieve his aims as the story unfolds roberts is well behind in the polls a leftist journalist portrayed by giancarlo esposito tries to further derail roberts ' campaign by revealing his drug running and other criminal activities will he be successful can a journalist representing a small publication take down the rich and powerful you will not be glued to your seat due to the suspense but the story line is n't a complete bore if nothing else you will see countless well known motion picture stars come and go throughout the story did you ever wonder why the became unglued over the iraqi liberation of 2003 well bob roberts should help enlighten you it makes numerous references to desert storm our first invasion of iraq in 1991. the conflict was allegedly a conspiracy concocted by the devious national security council '' this group really runs the country and not our elected leaders the republican administration of george bush 41 only wanted to dominate the region our greedy complex had to be satisfied and would not take no for an answer saddam hussein was not another adolph hitler a minor league dictator senator brickley paiste dismisses him as merely another member of the villain of the month club '' david thomson flares into darknes
although the script was written in the bob roberts '' does n't feel dated instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of american politics the title character bob is a conservative folk singer who runs for the senate but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe what struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens while i thought that the message of the movie was right on target i did n't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film it kept me at a distance from the characters and as a result i did n't care as much about them as i might have done
i first saw bob roberts '' in 1992 when it came out and when i was younger and further to the left than i am now and i thought it was terrific looking back on it i 'm amazed at how easily manipulated i was the movie purports to be an expos of how conservatives exploit the media to pander to voters ' baser emotions but bob roberts '' does just that to pander to the paranoia and hysteria of the strident left which has become ever more strident and paranoid since george bush became president see some of the reviews of this movie which use words like nazipuglican '' to describe the writers ' political opponents various snipes of mine about the movie its actual hero the muckraking '' journalist can be found ranting on countless marxist blogs these days robbins has the character murdered but in real life the cia has higher priorities than killing off loons who discredit themselves with their own lunacy the preachy folk songs that roberts sings are matched in their wooden polemics and poor musicianship by any number of preachy folk songs that can be heard on college radio stations and in coffeehouses across the the television producer 's liberal assistant who shuts off all the electricity in the tv studio where roberts is about to perform is no heroine she 's a censor pure and simple just like the campus morons who attend speeches by those with whom they disagree in order to drown them out with shouting chanting and booing no wonder the audience in the people 's republik of cambridge ma movie theatre in which i first saw bob roberts '' gave her a hearty round of applause but the part of the film that gets me the angriest 13 years later is the exchange between one of roberts ' campaign workers a black man and a liberal black woman she essentially accuses him of being an uncle tom '' he asks her mildly ca n't black people have differences of opinion '' she snaps back oh you 're still black '' this mindset promulgated by the jesse jacksons and al sharptons of this world has done more in the last 30 years to keep black americans poor than any klansman has and it 's still going on as can be seen by the left 's ugly snipes at condi rice and most recently at gov michael steele of maryland i 'm giving bob roberts '' two stars not one because it did have its moments and because was in fact something of a pioneer in hollywood in illustrating the mechanisms behind political media machines long before wag the dog '' came out but if you want to see thoughtful moviemaking from robbins rent dead man walking
what lies beneath '' is the type of ghost story movie in the same mold as stir of echoes '' and what i mean by this is that it is a revenge ghost story in other words the ghost in the movie is not the malevolent entity in the movie but the ghost 's killer is however these type of revenge ghost story movies do not work very well to present a truly pure horror movie viewing experience because once you realize the ghost just wants revenge the focus of the movie changes to the punishment of the mortal killer s and much of the suspense and mystery of the supernatural becomes secondary or maybe even lost completely this is unfortunate and such is the case with both what lies beneath '' and stir of echoes '' harrison ford and michelle pfeiffer star in what lies beneath '' and they are both great actors and i have no problem with them in this movie no it 's the script that i do not feel presents pure and unadulterated horror if you just want to see a drama this movie is fine but as a horror movie it does not function well as such in fact as a horror movie this movie sucks the only movie like this that actually works as a horror movie in my opinion is a movie called the changeling '' with george scott i would recommend the changeling '' any day over what lies beneath '' or any other movie like this which have become somewhat popular in the horror genre over the last years unfortunately these movies are riddled by a common flaw which extinguishes the mystery of the supernatural which ignited the audience 's interest in the movie in the first place if people think this is a good drama that is fine but i just hate it when i read reviews and get all excited about watching a horror movie and it turns out the movie sucks as a horror movie such is the case with what lies beneath ''
after 40 minutes of objective viewing and shot after superfluous shot i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from kong is not an epic it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing if you will but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this jackson no more 'epic shots please
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ! peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
the depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned from the moment they reached king kong 's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience i felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape how can anyone feel anything for king kong he keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island forces them to provide him sacrificial women and tortures the female star of the movie it seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking king kong the villains of the movie were my heroes i kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end
this was a mess this movie gave me the feeling that i was was watching a really bad made for tv film i was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was everyone just seemed like they were through their roles viggo mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan all in all this film was predictable formulaic and a bore please save your money for something worthwhile
i wanted to see this film in theaters i am a cronen fan i admit i was n't really a huge fan on viggo mortensen i never read the book but somehow i was drawn to this film indirectly so i wait for the dvd which is n't such a bad dvd as it is a film firstly there are no surprises any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer the dvd cover or the dvd ad viggo 's performance as a whole was n't too shabby ed harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie so in this small secluded town tom stall aka 'joey turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero although it turns out tom stall was n't much of a hero as he was a villain that 's about it the movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet the sex scenes felt out of place more than anything i could n't stress that enough i 'm going to be blunt they are too random they are in bad taste they are uncomfortable they are very much disliked by me personally and finally the ending the ending was probably the most empty finish i 've ever witnessed tom stall goes after his brother takes care of him drives back and sits down for a nice meal with the family three words fade to black i give this movie 2 out of 5 stars for two reasons some of the action scenes were interesting and ed harris i would not recommend this film
starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing problem with the media is bias the problem with this film is the same bias
the high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by george orwell or francis schaeffer or theodore dalrymple or even john mortimer the loyal opposition smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read paleo conservative journals like american conservative to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy that went on for a full 8 years under clinton as well is challenged by both those on the left and the is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis try reading how shall we then live '' by schaeffer or dalrymple 's our culture what 's left of it '' for a more intelligent and cogent analysis
interesting premise but the plot is like swiss cheese this review will just be a point by point of all the major things that i found so implausable that i could n't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride spoilers alert i was n't able to make the leap to believing sarah 's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash when questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she could n't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort but satisfaction why did hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it surely it would n't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it 's disappearance the first murder after the old guy regained consciousness why did hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him for hank finishing the job his brother started did n't seem like an absolute last resort it seemed like he took the murder lightly when hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he 'd just done what like he knew she 'd be understanding about it or something hi honey i 'm home by the way i just killed a man to protect the money wtf when jacob shot lou to protect hank why did n't hank just give the tape back before it got to that point the shotgun impact on lou 's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast did n't even hit her at an upward trajectory and the final ridiculous flaw jacob taking the fake fbi agent 's gun and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react he hands it to his brother and charges him with the responsibility of killing him setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film supposedly the explanation was that it would n't look like the fake fbi agent shot jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range but why not why could n't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff wrestled with him and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head it really makes no sense one inspiredly believable moment i will give them film credit for is hank 's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff 's office and loading the gun a lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded if the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film as it is it 's a frustratingly glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch
the many toubled undemocratic areas of africa do n't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the united states is destroyed whether or not he actually had the capability to do so the leader of iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability but thanks for commenting as for the film i know it won a couple oscars and all but i just did n't like it i thought the editing was poor that the scenes were long and often unnecessary although the story was good a modern director would have put it together a lot better
i read the only review for this item and ordered it expecting to see a fantastic display of sound and some of the interaction of these artists with mr hancock as they created music each colaborating to have a unique blend of sounds actually this is only a documentary showing this interaction and as such is very interesting but if you are looking to see an hear the full length videos of these great colaborations you will be disappointed that is not included in this dvd only small samples are there for you to see this was a real disapointmet because the quality of video and audio are fantastic
stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid though made during the cold war its portrayal of russian people is unfairly and in a review i read elsewhere it was described as xenophopic i would go so far as to say it is propagandistic its the kind of film which will appeal to today 's american who thinks he 's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior the idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film
i hate lawyers what is a lawyer anyway basically it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an class womb shakespeare said it first and best first let 's kill all the lawyers ! '' former enron john wing put a little houston spin on that one get all the lawyers in a room shoot 'em ! the mouth so you miss ! '' exactly anyway the firm '' is a flick that purports to make the world of yappers exciting so i was probably all amped up to despise it but not really back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater i briefly considered going into law briefly for about an hour it was a desperate time and i needed money why did i consider walking hell 's highway if only for an instant because john grisham boring a kind of tom clancy for the and set made it all sound pretty damned funky and lucrative ! hey dig that bmw 7 series baby beep beep ! in his engrossing little novel the firm '' granted i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes but it held my attention i mean seriously you 're 19 and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool and strippers man plenty of strippers oh and did someone mention a bmw what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your now it 's true grisham writes like kim jong il sings but the firm '' anyway was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace from the pedestrian law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis law firm the pretty damned atrocious all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense suffocating sense of malice grisham like michael crichton is n't a prose genius he 's not even mediocre but he writes for film and the firm '' cried out for cinematic treatment so it 's baffling that with all the right stuff cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere gene hackman doing his gene hackman thang as the corrupt but ultimately and pathetic senior partner and sydney pollack helming it up the treatment of the firm '' is such a yawner talk about contempt of court pollack takes all that intricately woven little and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen at its guts really the firm '' was really nothing more than the big career nightmare i 've bet the farm on this gig i 'm getting big money i 'm working like a fiend my wife is having trouble remembering my name and evidently i 'm not doing for loaded clients 'm doing money laundering for the mob pollack just mangles the whole thing convolutes the simple and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning casting is part of the problem cruise does his thing running around memphis with his briefcase hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure sleaze the firm '' is all when he 's onscreen but hey a man can only do so much jeanne tripplehorn cruise 's squeeze who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn seriously google the two of 'em astounding ! is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief too bald too cracker too rotund too silly too to do the role justice holly hunter is even worse hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy which is baffling given that she 's about and has all the sex appeal of an it does n't help that she 's a big ugly southern stereotype the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be you want her to die she does n't pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny she is n't ed harris i think is in this movie so is hal holbrook which kinda ruins everything because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks anyway the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance deus ex machina of paul sorvino don morolto kind of goombah name is dat anyway somebody call tony soprano ! who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous if you wan na see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours by all means belly up to the bar otherwise case dismissed js
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
i love this topic as discovered in what the bleep however this book as a follow up is a disappointment it is basically a documentary of how the scientists did the experiments and does not really expand on the significane of the findings or offer any new eye opening insights the dvd is especially boring to watch the book at least has some nice pictures
this dvd was probably the stupidest thing i have ever watched there is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production the water crystals are pretty SMILE but everything else about this production is complete nonsense
hmmmm funny thing this was released on dvd and not in a scientific journal do n't waste your time with fake science there are plenty of real science out there
if you 've seen one you 've seen them all uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl she brings him out of his shell well i bought this for like two dollars and maybe it was worth it i watch it like once a year no special features on dvd worth mentioning ben affleck is getting married he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding but things keep getting in his way forces of nature also he keeps running into and ca n't seem to get away from some weird chick bullock are these signs should he stop being so uptight and go with this chick or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle the acting in this movie is meh '' meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie and affleck sucks as usual the other small parts are well done for the most part the script is formulaic and the cinematography at times is interesting it 's just another where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell the movie opens with a stripper scene no nudity there is also a scene in this movie there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar just thought i 'd throw that in in case you 're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something and that kind of thing bothers you you only need to buy this is you are a fanatic or a big fan of either affleck or bullock otherwise this is completely forgettable
okay the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen but i like the actors especially ben 's best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why do n't they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor '' charade was so predictable oh gee he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and holmes '' might have to step up and uh they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gon na get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah 's little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they 're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he 's breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let 's just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane ! ! ! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously does n't have a clue what he wants in life and i 'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us do n't do it ! '' and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it 's just marriage it 's romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after ! it 's been my experience when things are n't feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap
simply put the movie is boring upon is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural '' response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend '' and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie save your money save your time choose another movie
there is a certain school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash '' but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream '' motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek
me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive '' than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever ! perhaps i 'm biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers
this film is boring so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop this is a soap opera about politics oil companies it 's weird jump around style is confusing pointless do yourself a favor and do n't bother this garbage
to be fair the legends of herakles as they were originally written have little to do with this movie but maybe that 's for the best having grown up on superman batman and the justice league i have a hard time calling a person like herakles a hero in the original legends he was a warrior but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage he also was n't as far as i can tell as strong as in this version therefore interpretations of herakles are i think to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend but on where and why disney has attempted to take herakles or hercules in the roman and make it a story about a true hero and a perfect one at that there 's nothing i like more than perfect heroes they inspire me conceptually i like the idea instead of herakles being the illegitimate son of zeus and a mortal woman he 's conceived in love by zeus and hera and turned mortal by a potion not bad as changes go it works better than most herc meets meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him another deviation from the legend and a very good improvement of course because hera is his mother in this version she ca n't be herc 's enemy so they make his opponent hades lord of the dead which could be worse as changes go i 've never seen hades as being all that bad of a guy but that 's how it goes then there 's the hydra which is if anything much larger and more powerful than it was originally so that 's good too aside from this however i have to say i was disappointed with most of the changes the titans to start with were underplayed considerably it might have been premature to mention that they were zeus ' predecessors but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had and a appearance oceanus for example lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose or cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence particularly since hercules did n't beat the titans alone in the original stories nor does it make sense that he should in this one grabbing a whirlwind come on now i actually did n't mind hades ' demeanor all that much though i did n't see a reason why he should have powers when that 's clearly apollo 's territory further i thought most of the gods and muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature why is this the case i think disney made the mistake in this film of not just trying to make the legends clean but fun as well and there 's nothing fun about war i 'm not saying they could n't have made the concept work in fact i 'm saying they could have made it work if they 'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect justice league style still for what it 's worth this is one of the few movies left in the world that is n't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero and for that it 's worth at least one viewing rent it from your local video store in my opinion before you make your decision
i am so mad at disney and their movie hercules '' because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories i like greek mythology but the movies have not been good at all and this weak effort is not going to do anything about it the plot has been changed completly pegasus is never mentioned in the real version he is not trying to impress people he had no trainer the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned the hydra fight is because of a different reason ugly characters hercules was never in love with a chick hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either and all kinds of things that i wo n't mention do n't buy this movie because it is completly different why do n't you read greek mythology instead of watching this
this version of the dvd promises on the cover that english or english closed captioning is available in fact the menu provides only english with closed captions with all the little sound descriptions like water sloshing cattle lowing people muttering which while possibly useful to the are a constant irritation for a hearing viewer i 'm returning this dvd and will wait 'til fox gets their presentation right in line with the features description on the case sheesh
i rented this dvd because of the glowing reviews here and because i wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the middle east overall i was disappointed by this offering because it did n't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject it also seems to me to be biased in israel 's favor the palestinians but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately for instance the documentary jumps right into the last zionist congress in 1939 or whenever it was but they never define what the zionist movement is or where it came from i know some of this from my reading but it would be nice to have a summary here especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary i wish the documentary would have at least started with wwi and the british occupation of palestine after the fall of the ottoman empire rather than picking up at wwii and mentioning some of the wwi details later doing so would have answered questions like why are the british so important here '' another example is keeping track of the people places and organizations which are often named in hebrew or arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated it made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where using more text on the screen more maps more recaps and perhaps more english translations would have improved things greatly methinks the film certainly has value not least because it is told by a participant and observer but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people places and issues at hand
the case high crimes begins with grainy footage of a bunch of bodies lined up in a grungy town while an elderly woman wails over and over we flash back to the happy marriage of claire ashley judd and tom kubik james caviezel who are trying to start a family she 's a successful lawyer he 's a successful marine their life is disrupted by a by some punks in a trend that is highly representative of the disjointed plotline of high crimes tom is suddenly arrested tom 's name is actually sergeant ron chapman and he is wanted for the execution of a bunch of people in another country but proclaims his innocence complicated by the fact that claire is pregnant so claire buckles down she decides to stand by her man and act as counsel on the case after meeting ron 's defense lieutenant terrence embry adam scott a newbie for sure claire 's not dumb she knows she needs help she pulls in alex cross i mean charles grimes played by morgan freeman complicating things is jackie amanda peet claire 's sister i 'm bringing high crimes up on charges of opaque plot points awful stereotypes and worst of all just being plain boring the charges are as follows high crime 1 using grimes ' alcoholism for laughs it 's not funny and it 's insulting to alcoholics high crime 2 portraying the marines as bloodthirsty incompetent thugs who terrorize women and the downtrodden it 's offensive to just about everyone in the armed forces high crime 3 the jackie character does n't need to be in the movie peet 's sole purpose is apparently to walk around in underwear so that judd does n't have to high crime 4 idiotic clues ambidextrous people do not all throw things back and forth in their hands that is certainly not indicative of a person being a criminal worse in the flashback sequences the main bad guy tosses an not an easy weapon to toss around back and forth in his hands all to demonstrate he 's ambidextrous and therefore the killer high crime 5 a long 115 minute plot with a depressing conclusion that does n't make up for any of the nonsense we had to put up with to get to the end lesser charges unbelievable plot points a civilian lawyer defending her military husband choppy editing what does the have to do with anything cheesy music that telegraphs when bad things are about to happen tm characters that appear out of nowhere and then disappear until conveniently needed and really stupid terror tactics by the shadowy bad guys your honor i find high crimes guilty of all of the above charges and recommend both judd and freeman be given better acting opportunities yuri zelster and grace cary bickley sent to writing school and director carl franklin sentenced to acting in the alf christmas special again
fine acting especially by morgan freeman unfortunately the drunk but brilliant lawyer is a bit of a cinematic cliche then we have to deal with the conspiracy by the military and the husband being the fall guy do n't read any further if you want to watch this movie so we go through this whole conspiracy investigation the general is sufficiently blackmailed to have the charges dropped then the guy ends up as having done it after all so then the conspiracy was really a bogus plot device to mislead the audience the phone taps ashley judd being followed getting beaten up etc etc etc all misdirection by the writers and director but the cast and acting were all good
other reviews rant about judd frankly after double jeopardy and high crimes i 'm not seeing the superb actress but that 's aside the point this movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else search for truth not innocence especially if you are an attorney
as much as i like morgan freeman and ashley judd i really wanted to like this film i enjoyed them in kiss the girls and i expected another interesting film their performances were the only bright spot but they could n't rescue this movie this film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream there was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible as many other reviewers noted i only wish i had read the reviews before i wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces it was so very predictable i rented 2 films yesterday and i had trouble watching both of them for very different reasons the other film was monster '' starring charlize theron and christina ricci i almost could n't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and i forgot that it was a movie it absolutely is a gripping story and theron richly deserved the best actress oscar that she received for it conversely i almost could n't watch high crimes because it was so ridiculous do yourself a favor and skip this one
funny and very inspirational good way to encourage young teenagers to build self esteem if there 's a will there 's a way anyone can dance
i think this dvd was corny i 've been getting dvds and vhs for years as i would rather exercise at home then spend time getting to a from the gym i 've seen some with poor cueing and others i do long enough that it 's time to move on to something new i 'm not sure how to pinpoint or put words to my impression of this but karen seemed very unreal and i want something more down to earth i like seeing strong women that i would like to be more like and while the guy and gal in the back were fine karen was just too annoying up front
touring is an emotional rollercoaster '' wow guys tell me something that steve perry did n't cover about twenty years ago when journey did their own 'my life on the road is hard '' video blah blah blah if you 're looking for new ideas or insights you are n't going to find them here if you are looking for any visual stimulation besides the random town through window '' good luck i admit i love their music and in print deathcab interviews well but this little filmstrip fails to capture either very well which probably is less of a critique on the band than the who knows what a better cutter might have come up with on the pro side they did shoot it all in and some of the extras the lightness demo in particular are excellent buy their music yes see them live yes buy this dvd only if you want something to while your doing your taxes
i really liked death cab until i bought ! if you enjoy a whole dvd of a band complaining about how hard it is to be on the road and singing the same songs every go for it ! they seem like a bunch of pretentious did not help their image i know its so tough touring the world playing the music you love but do n't make a whole dvd devoted to your whining yuck again
the music and dance moves are fun but a basic concept in exercise was missed here all of the shots are taken from the front unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the opposite side of the body that you are viewing you will be awfully confused it is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from behind so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body one of the few exercise videos that does this is the firm 's boomers '' too bad it 's not available anymore
korrect with this one i have n't seen her video and i would not buy a single one because i know exactly what 'tc ' is talking about this female moves waaaayyyy to fast for a person to grasp the moves how do i know you ask well i have comcast cable and and if you hit on demand '' she has a 12 minute session under 'life and fitness ' i think that 's the heading she is under the 'quick workouts ' section and she just ought 2 be because that 's just how quick she moves i guess in defense of the video it does n't say 'beginner ' but damn is just that some of tha ' moves can be a bit complicating and tha ' foot work confusing and it does n't take a rocket scientist to understand that you need to slow it down if you tryin ' ta ' teach it you see tha ' dancers on videos it requires a lot of energy she will have you to me anyway huffing and puffing a little to hard and to early in the game and never wanting to exercise again do n't get me wrong hmpff ! she moves great not stiff like some but if she wants to reach a broader audience slow down and put the routine together after a few practices of each step ! i am one who views 'instructional ' dvd 's times first i try them it helps you to memorize the routine direction of the body foot work to some extent but it does n't work with this chick instructors are suppose to motivate you but this female can kill any motivation a person has who is trying really hard to gain better health me she wo n't kill mine i 'll just move to someone who understands that first impressions applies to exercise instructors as well do n't give up ! i believe a good aerobic session be fun it will also help you burn a 'krap ' load of calories with a proper diet you just have to get the right instructor bcuz baaaaby she is not it ! ! ! ! !
three problems with this film 1. pacing the film 's pacing does n't vary it 's very boring as a matter of fact this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense speed '' however this film lacks the intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed 2. effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror '' scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting 3. triviality the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the so what '' question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that '' in light of points 1 and 2 this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake do n't waste your life alon
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here crash '' comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world '' my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here 's a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i do n't like any of these people so their pain does n't mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would 've worked but now there just is n't anything there as far as what 's actually in the movie we 've got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we 've got jared 's mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto 's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there 's no real attempt to make wayans into a person he 's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that 's it the doubly sad fact is that he 's the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it 's a wonder that the smack does n't cause them to cease to exist entirely well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually the bergman films i 've seen so that 's not really a fair comparison they love each other apparently but since i do n't even like either of them i 'm not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it would n't have been funny if i cared about her but we 've been over that and i want you people to know that i 'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie 's dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting '' which has characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba '' a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream '' so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that 's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream '' is n't helped any by darren aronofsky 's repetitive derivative the trouble is this movie has n't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they 're hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see a thousand times montages a million times and plenty of wonky junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai n't drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that does n't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky was n't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters were n't going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that 's a good ending grade ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows
i give this film one star for the acting which is often very good however the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness and debase every aspect of lower income urban people in all honesty i 've seen more joy in an african famine i sat through this film against my better judgement still if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty then i recommend a streetcar named desire '' kids '' last exit to brooklyn '' and traffic ''
this is one of my favorite movies but i was very disappointed with the dvd version in the middle of the movie you will have to get up go to your dvd player and flip the dvd over to the second side to see the rest of the movie i do n't know what bozo came up with that idea but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie who wants to get up and flip the dvd over in the middle of the suspense this format takes stupidity to the next level i would highly recommend the vhs since i have it and it 's wonderful i would not recommend the dvd until they do a better version the packaging is in paper and not durable at all another truly bad idea dvd 's should be in plastic cases not paper
this movie comes from john grisham 's novel of the same title most of the actions taking place in the novel were also presented in this movie the spotlight reviews goodly summarize the movie even when i do n't agree with their rankings the first movie 's problem is the character 's personalities less credible many times one reviewer well said the fbi 's personnel looks rather wimpy the merciless coal fletcher looks like a simple clerk while he is the real president in the novel on the other hand the novel 's heroine darby shaw losses her strong personality but at the same time behaves in obnoxious ways for example in one scene she asks her best female friend to spread a gossip in college but darby does not care whatsoever for her friend 's safety as in the novel darby even tells her that it 's not good for her darby to stay there '' darby does all the opposite in the novel next her friend does all what she says this not credible the second movie 's error is the way the show the events for example as i said fletcher is not portrayed as a tough way there 's even an scene where we see his seeing his family 's picture at his desk really charming however he is still punished in the movie any honest person who does not let to be impressed by the reputations of the actors and director should admit that the movie is not always understandable i watched this movie right when released in 1992 and i did n't understand it but the huge julia roberts ' success was on its highest so i did n't think much just considered it was sort of boring now i read the novel watched the movie again and understood the movie was flawed in fact all bad guys in the movie were only small fishes who chased darby i also complain that the movie shows some misbehaviour as good ones for example in one scene the president asks the fbi chief voyles to stop a crime investigation voyles offers to do it in exchange of favours this is plain corruption yet the movie made it look like a cocktail party ! in another scene one character callahan is about to start driving while drunk and darby only plays a little bit to stop him just to finally let him get on his car the movie added a few action scenes the novel does n't have yet it is quite boring the novel has less action yet it is more exciting
so i can see there are some julia roberts fans out there too bad just raving about her will never improve her acting skills an oxymoron actually the poor quality of this movie is astounding considering its director the cast excepting our girl julia and the book upon which it was based though he 's done some much better work when pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing hmm 'presumed innocent ' was a winner let 's follow that same formula and do another one it 'll sell '' unfortunately by the time the story from the book by john grisham got to the screen it lacked any of its original punch as for denzel he should be ashamed of himself he 's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach i guess he probably needed the cash for another house then again he 's opposite julia no further comment needed than save your money
i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for 19 bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is while the latter jinnai is without a doubt the best character in the series despite the fact that he is the antagonist you ca n't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story 's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series all four dismal episodes so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely and an effective leader even though he was also manic and delusional in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let 's face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty
i hate to say this about such an amazing show but unless you can find it for 19.95 or less do not buy it this season does not have an feature no comedy on tv should release a dvd without a bloopers reel scrubs has always been known for the best bloopers it 's why many of us shell out 30 for the season as soon as it hits the shelves interviews with the cast and crew are only valuable to the cast and crew and deleted scenes are useful to remind the writers that you care about them but the audience wants to be entertained with more than what we can see on comedy central in a few months seriously the show is in syndication now and the value of the actual episodes goes way south after that give me more to make me laugh
do n't let a propoganda wheel fool you of the truth 1. the miami herald gained access to all florida ballots and did their own recount at their own time who won bush ! http 2. there is a case that african american voters were turned away however where is the same case for the many haitan american voters who were also turned away in droves who are known to be sympathetic towards republican causes the filmmakers had a chance to make a point about voter rights and election problems they turned this to an attack against president bush and republicans instead sadly their message will only be heard by instead of the world because of their decisio
bottom line 1. if you liked gore you will love it and visa versa 2. it is plain and simple 3. nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough english to distinguish gore from bush '' democrats wanted quantity and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just could n't get right
this film is disappointing considering the acting talent used in it the story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble and is supposedley framed his father the cop deniro must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime it is not very suspenseful and the end result regardless what avenue they take is dull there is no wonder for who really committed the crime who framed who or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie it just falls flat and it 's to bad that deniro wasted his time and talents being in this film if you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame try recent movies like along came a spider man on fire or collateral deeper plots without the predictable outcomes
ok i 've only just seen this film for the first time so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect but this is not a particularly good film i mean it has its choice moments where it really comes together the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed any scene with is almost guaranteed classic status samuel jackson 's in it and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his similarity but that 's really my problem with this film serious issues are reduced to a series of archetypes straight out of central casting and they 're all here the homey black grandparents the nation of islam convert the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth take the french film 'la haine ' for instance it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society boyz n tha hood but its characters actually feel tormented instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment rather than just running through a laundry list of problems it really gets to the heart of something bigger some grander alienation that urban youths feel which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do plus if you can believe it the in 'la haine ' is quite a bit better so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film keep the remote aimed and ready finger on the button maybe about a of this film is really worth watching whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising oh yeah and there 's a really sex scene thrown in for no particular reason oh also the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking but it really just cheapens this one
i have not yet received this item hopefully it is on its way it has been over three weeks
these plays were okay i 'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre definitely no tyler perry quality on that note but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he didn't
when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue you may as well turn it off the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash
in good company '' goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it did n't make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it is n't an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace
maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat '' on top of that the acting was horrible this movie did n't take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor
other reviewers who detail the silly and are right this is ford 's jack ryan was sometimes a step behind but in a believable way the audience was right beside ryan and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action boy did he take action ben affleck 's jack ryan is terminally lost pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive or at least interesting this is going to go down as the star wars prequel '' of clancy movies the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love
its tough when you watch and work out to a video that has people leading that should n't be on film this was a one time viewing that i can not watch or try agai
i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever rea
this is a crass emotional be it well produced manipulation that gives the viewer a warm fuzzy feeling while very slyly promoting war is a duty to your country or what have you at the same time manipulting the viewers emotions very very effectively war is mass indescriminate death of fooled young men and innocent civilians directed by millionaires who 's prime purpose is to profit from the killing think for a minute about what you 're being told behind this mass of emotional manipulation
continuing the ashley judd series of movies that i for some reason keep putting on my netflix list i decided to give judd a second chance by watching double jeopardy by now we all know the formula pretty young lead and older grizzled veteran team up to fight crime only in this case the twist is that libby parsons judd is actually on the wrong side of the law libby lives in perfect harmony with her husband nick bruce greenwood and son matty benjamin weir only nick is a particularly vile brand of sleazeball while away on a boating trip and after a scene that involves far more of judd than twisted every showed libby wakes up with her husband missing and blood on her hands literally she is tried and convicted for murder sounds like a quick end to the movie right not exactly libby discovers that her husband is still alive and has since shacked up with libby 's best friend angie green annabeth gish as one inmate succinctly explains libby can kill her husband since she ca n't be convicted of the same crime twice why because that would be double jeopardy ! the state says you already killed your husband right so when you get out of here you track him down and you can kill him you can walk up to him in times square put a gun to his head and pull the trigger and there 's nothing they can do about it ! kinda makes you feel all warm and tingly inside do n't it '' this is of course patently untrue in movieland double jeopardy makes it seem like killing her husband would let her get off without any punishment in reality libby could be tried by the state government instead of the federal government for another separate but related crime or worst of all end up with her son being taken away from her the real driving force in the movie is libby 's love for her son a child that obviously ca n't be left in the manipulating clutches of her murderous husband in essence the whole premise of the movie is a tease it 's not even important whether or not double jeopardy applies it 's clear that libby does n't want to kill her husband anyway i do n't want to kill you nick '' says libby i just want you to suffer '' she wants her son back and that 's that somewhere in the middle of this mess is the redoubtable tommy lee jones as travis lehman in the same role of a parole officer he played in the fugitive and marshals his role is largely irrelevant except to represent the threat of the law that dogs libby 's ever step everyone speaks their lines with the appropriate level of enthusiasm but really there 's not a whole lot for anyone to do mostly libby pines for her son slowly unraveling the tangled web her husband has weaved to cover up his hasty departure from life and marriage somehow libby does n't manage to age at all in the years she 's been in prison the best part of the film is when libby dressed to the nines confronts her husband at a charity auction if the film were half as good as that scene it would have been truly something instead we have a lackluster script a flimsy premise and the talents of tommy lee jones wasted on what amounts to the female fugitive
the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or it is actually completely false the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered or is otherwise the victim but what you did in distinct criminal incidents even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone if you go back and murder them again '' then that is a new incident and double jeopardy does not apply in movies intended to be fantastic diverging this much from reality might be but this is a mainstream legal thriller it 's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women do n't for no apparent reason but the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means or they just accurately banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is
after reading the storyline of this movie it seems like a framing movie so i did n't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out
the first movie was fantastic the second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better this third movie was absolute trash and i will never buy it
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd 's characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he does n't have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her is not like other people basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think blinks i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that 's it flat and mechanical
the dvd did n't work and returning it could n't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless
the whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer in short the disjointed story line goes like this troubled teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit whose face resembled iron maiden 's eddie ! who gives him he escapes death a jet engine crashing through his roof because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny he discovers some old hag named roberta sparrow he knew was an ex teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes ' same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected ' are you still with me ! ! ! i love and fiction but all this is beyond ridiculous ! that my friends is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens ' film is about ! i mean 'gigli ' was a better film for chrissakes ! even the time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable in the end the only redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like the church duran duran joy division and tears for fears hardly enough to save the film though if you must rent 'dd ' if your curiosity is piqued but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your or your parents ' money
man did i want to like this movie hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a gem was really tantalizing but this film is really really mediocre first we have city going on bad mid life crisis stuff with susan clark and hackman trying to communicate '' about their failing relationship it 's tough on hackmans character harry '' see 'cause he used to be an nfl player and now he 's reduced to being a private eye she hates it he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech do n't get me wrong this is no megaforce '' where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable this is just mediocre buy harper '' with paul newman instead
this show deserved to get cancelled and there 's a very simple reason this is supposedly dry subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry subtle comedy it 's a show that was presented to the fox audience an audeince that normally likes the most inane kind of humor that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it meanwhile to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor the comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke it 's clear how forced and contrived it is how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor something they clearly do n't understand it 's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat it 's just an awkward mess but those are n't the people this show is targeted at it 's targeted at that fox audience who has never even seen dry humor before and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them they think this show is brilliant because it 's a little smarter than mad tv or at least thinks it is and since those are the people who are seeing the show you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is if the show were on hbo or some other network exposed to a different kind of audience you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works so why did this show get cancelled when so many people think it 's so amazing if it 's so great people would have actually watched it right so where were the ratings the fact is the people who love this show are a very vocal minority the audience for dry humor did n't watch this show because it 's not funny but the audience who was fooled by this show as vocal as they are was just too small they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it this is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for tv as its apologists claim no it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes
four brothers '' is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood '' has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys ' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers '' is filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more
almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders but the movie 's not a total wash after all it 's got a great soundtrack
i got this film because i 'm from detroit where this takes place it 's a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe
i do not understand what the hype about this dvd is i baught it according to reviews but unfortunatly was very dissapointed i def felt a burn in my upper abs but you are laying on your back the entire time there is no changing positions and targeting the abs from diferent angles to me it was basically crunch after crunch after crunch would not recommend it unless you want buldge in your upper abs
what filth what utter tripe as if the early 90 's did n't have enough white people bad everyone else good '' movies along comes this sick unimaginative racist garbage i see by the ratings that many viewers like this movie some of whom appear unable to spell the most primitive words the english language has to offer let me ask you wannabe vatos locos this this movie had been about white people instead of latino people would you have thought this movie was racist think about it white people starting gangs on the street and in prison based on the principle of outkilling and outbreeding other races of people oh but when people do it suddenly it 's not racist more bs hollywood bigoted drivel by the way how is your vatos locos movement doing hmm has it been producing successful members of society or just more fodder for prison gang rape exactly you were racist degenerate losers back then and you 're racist degenerate losers now though i doubt you 'll ever learn vatos locos forever ! ha ha ha ha ha what an absolute joke what an insult to humanity grow up
i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent ! ! as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans after conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you 're under arrest '' they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino 's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior do n't waste your money or rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too
it 's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick clean minimalist thriller it 's not that much of the added material particularly the internal affairs feels and unnecessary it 's not even that pacino 's character is a shell of the dangerously detective of the original that one of the more complicated characters frya francke has been reduced down to set dressing or that the ending ruins the film 's moral atmosphere it 's the fact that nolan a sublimely talented director is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads pacino does the bit again taking it over the top in every single scene hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the hometown girl and robin williams well he 's robin williams the kids in this film katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson turn in fine performances that while hardly which they could n't be considering how far their roles have been pared down are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries ' mugging see the film for their performances but make sure you rent it and do n't pay too much to do so
unfortunately and as usual idiotic directors and editors have ruined a great show ! panning zooming cutting god it 's awful i remember hearing that bob was upset by it and apologized to the cast the really sad thing is that the show staged by kathy dobie bob 's long time assistant was beautifully recreated and then ruined by those fools filming during the big sex ballet '' the shoot from behind with glaring lights so that you really have no sense of what the dance is the sound it bad the cutting is bad and kat stinks all that said it will be your only chance to see what broadway dancers used to look like get it for the history by the way if you want to see another show that was totally ruined by bad cutting see sunday in the park with george this beautiful show was destroyed by idiotic editors !

a hospital understaffed going under then they make a mistake and kill a patient meanwhile a new patient with a dangerous rash is brought into the hospital and from there they all catch it blah blah blah sounds like it should be a decent movie it does have some creepy parts unfortunately it loses focus on its themes while trying to make you figure out what the heck is going on this is a ghost story medical misadventure or telenovela it goes all over the place and never satisfies technical issues are done poorly a good example is when one ghost appears they then hide her head in the mirror ooh so spookie for a year old but then there are her hands and arms in the mirror but all those criticisms are nothing compared to the worst acting ever ! ! ! the dialogue is absurd and the actors ' reactions are just painfully overdone the actors go from confused and sullen to emotionally anguished and screeching for no reason i can accept ghosts boogeymen flying knife throwing turkeys if i must but rns and mds who freak out when a patient needs resucitation who become emotionally unstable when a patient falls out of bed oh dear god do n't give that patient an aspirin ! ! ! ! what is then worse is their lesser reactions to an infection that makes look like a paper cut a doctor was mean to me '' manic crying and screeching that guy just exploded '' consternation what stupid stupid stupid stupid a last resort if you 've never seen it bottom of the ' barrel if you have never seen the genre try any other movie first
this film was boring and convoluted one big mess that you should not waste your precious cash on
i consider myself a huge pixar fan this is easily the most insipid pixar movie ever pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one i have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie pixar if you are listening please please dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of stuff i expect more from you
i 'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming but i feel ripped off just the same
it was terrible ! lili played a good part of course but the rest was just plain stupid
while i 've been a big fan of ghost in the shell these stories are the worst yet i 've watched the first three episodes on cartoon network as the dvd is not out yet in make up '' the story is flawed in that paz would have never been allowed to roam free '' while an exact copy cat of himself is on the lose killing people in poker face '' the emperial '' america is such and statement especially when the amercian un forces have the american flag sewed on their uniforms backwards ! this may have been an error but i doubt it in pat the tachikoma 's voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it 's hard to follow most if is a rehash on previous episodes with their childest voices they should n't be used as a main plot of the story
if you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking if you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again ! this video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing club '' clothing instead of spandex i was very disappointed with this purchase
personally i found this workout extremely difficult to follow the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand i grew frustrated other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition as i have obviously tried but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill both of which i believe are integral to any workout and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output one should n't have to teach themselves the moves to a less significant degree i agree with the reviews that comment on the cheesiness '' of the video at first such cheesiness made me laugh and then as i grew frustrated it merely made me further annoyed what i feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor marie forleo 's unsuccessful motivation attempts which are not only redundant but suggestive in a most unnecessary way i do n't mean to sound so aggressively negative i just wish i had been able to learn the moves because they did look like fun
i bought this dvd because of all of the good reviews i read here on i was disappointed the workout is only 30 minutes and couple that with the low intensity and i do n't think it 's worth the money so i 'm not totally negative i will say that it is fun and well instructed but i 'm definietly going to have to combine this with other dvd 's to get a good workout
this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them does n't seem to work if they did n't have the best prices for movies i 'd leave
i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch '' that is how good it is
wow what a disappointment great actors with a script from a fantastic book i loved the book so much i just could n't wait to see the movie and i missed it theaters so i watched it this weekend from netflix what can i say it 's boring ! i 'm not a huge fan of tom hanks especially with this hair it 's ok to hate me but i love iam mccellan and jean reno but these great actors just could n't save this movie and sofie neveau was so much more interesting in the book do n't waste your time on this one
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it the dvd we just purchased was horrible they chopped out so much of the movie it made it it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
i 'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about christianity by now thanks to this film and the book of the same title most individuals interested in christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus that being said i will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses as a movie the code leaves much to be desired there are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in the louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect for example langdon and detective neveu after successfully evading captain feche in the museum strike a series of clues writings bloodstains keys that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover langdon and detective neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions if might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction ian mckellen a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent lacks complete credibility in this film so what went catastrophically wrong well it was n't the book or its author dan brown who has been selling copies of the code faster then they can count them and although the performances were at best questionable by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie the most obvious answer as to why the code is so deficient is ron howard the director howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present the da vinci code in a manner believable as a film not history to the audience i think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with and had a supposition of jesus and his relationship to mary magdalene
musicals are historically slight in the plot department and this movie is no exception three stars one fading one rising and one coasting do not help matters either rita is the fading star it was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow the make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes and her hair and costumes are just bad novak is the rising star although i do n't get the 50 's obsession with bubble headed busty bleach blond bimbos it would help if she could act but sadly her range is very limited i truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic since she was unable to convey it herself then there is frank just coasting on his charm and cool does n't seem plausible that a hep cat like him who could bag any doll '' dame '' or mouse would fall for either of these gals anyway i gave it 2 stars because of snuffy the dog he stole every scene he was in although that was n't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie
this movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them for a theater lover this is heartbreaking what a disappointing story if a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a adulterer even the ending was changed and not for the better the dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing a pretty face is not enough
the dvd is n't a good abs workout or a cardio video the section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes the instructor was motivational but i did n't find the moves that creative or intense
the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we do n't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience do n't know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she is n't so that 's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes fortunately we 're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this does n't turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero '' who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that 's true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film 'dreamboat ' takes the turn as lead character and it 's his story we 're following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it 's her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out 'dreamboat ' and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters do n't have the same truth in mind it 's about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it 's not the comic book variety is n't fun for an audience it 's just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that 's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed
a very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level the movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue i 've heard better lines in 'fast times at richmond high ' thank you altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing do n't believe the great reviews about this film the film might appeal to the crowds fantasizing about how 'cool ' college life might be with all the 'cool ' people and 'parties ' if you 're not in that category skip this boring film and save both your time and your money
thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and
i gave this film two stars one star because i liked all the good character actors and another star for the quirky tune 'i 'm easy ' sung by surprised keith bateman gibson was one of the funniest stars of ' as was lily was approached by altman to star in this after several others backed it tries to be serious i find myself does play a very serious part as the mother of a deaf she played the role the good in this are wrong for the one in the real nashville music business could understand how outside people '' could make a credible film on them the film did not play well and was quickly 's a strange and unique film to watch though its lasting effect is one associated with the film really understand what the scene in film just reinforces silly steorotypes of the south
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash '' and godsford park '' and then stink up the joint with this what 's up with that
this film is unbelievably dull it 's clocked at 2 hours and 40 minutes but i could n't swear to it because after just under one hour i had to turn it off it was so boring because there was no plot critics seem to like movies with no plot i do n't seinfeld was a show about nothing but it was funny this movie is not funny if you want to see a good funny robert altman movie watch
the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this to catch it on tbs or something
yeah ok ice cube is a bounty hunter and mike epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys am i right on that right the story is great but not that great so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky thats what it was like for me folks god i almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this for cube and epps and eva mendes fans only and if you wan na see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it then this is the film for you
this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have billing but blink and you 'll miss him
in a visual perspective it 's provocative shocking and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words but overall the movie creeped me out
it 's a cute premise but looks as though it were filmed by a group of kids for a school project the dance moves were briefly too briefly demonstrated additionally some of the attitude '' displayed was questionable for younger kids
i knew renting this movie was a mistake the minute the dvd menu came up what 's with these documentary makers do they think we have the attention spans of lobotomized cocker spaniels why does every damn documentary produced in the last ten years look like it was edited by someone with tourette 's syndrome on speed by chance i saw the great dictator '' and strangelove '' right before i saw this stupid movie and if you want to see biting satire and mockery of the powerful go see those for all you bush haters i am reviewing the movie not the allegations made in it
i found this documentary left out some information about the bush family that i thought would be included the documentary did not cover george bush 's grandfather 's working relationship with the nazi party during the second world war nor did the doc spend much time on the rest of george 's relatives and family members the doc did n't include as much information as i thought that it would and the material that it covered has already been covered in other documentaries like fahrenheit the host of the documentary had to assert his fedora for no reason which was more distracting and annoying to see in what i expected to be a hard hitting serious documentary
this is a classic example of what liberals resort to ever since becoming unable to win at the ballot box
this is a very uninforming movie i 'm usually a fan of a good propaganda movie but this is just bad there is no relevent information here they simply tell you ideas that you most likely allready had in your head without confirming them with hard evidence if you want to watch an actually worth while journalistic film about the bush ties then get martial law 911 rise of the police state now that is one brilliant peice of wor
denzel washington is probably my favorite actor even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate he shone tom hanks well lem me quit hating the guy this is a movie tom did a creditable job and we had extreme with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy a passionate one though since he 's still a latino after all actually this is a hollywood message movie '' and you know what that means it 's about as subtle as michael moore those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie those who do n't agree with the message stay as far away from it as possible there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy the way they stared at him reminded me of lao wei in china '' experiences denzel 's character was reminded of segregation even though he 's too young to remember it and started to care about tom hanks ' character aids discrimination is bad actually any discrimination at all is bad and that 's the movie 's message i agree with the message but still that 's all we 've got as a totally irrelevant if the name sam francisco '' means anything to you you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination i love a great courtroom drama this one was merely good with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a film they had to take a few shortcuts here sad ai n't it but even so a film that i 'm glad i saw once not twice once is enough thank you
i just wanted to get my 1 star recorded as payback to this movie for wasting my time although i did start doing other things halfway through the only positive thing i can say is that the actor portraying blevins the third wheel did a fine job when he was n't onscreen i was wondering what he was up to and wishing i could be spending my time with him instead of the other two dullards we are unfortunately stuck with penelope cruz adds zero to the movie do n't know if it 's due to editing or acting and do n't really care can you tell i 'm disgusted if you 're a movie fan or a western fan you should be too
all the pretty horses in the first few moments you know how the film will go wrong voice is often misused in movies based on books as a way to capture some of the original author 's especially damning here we hear the miscast matt damon offering cole 's commentary on what has happened where he lives what is wrong with it and thus why he must go the problem is that commentary does n't exist in the novel in fact we never get inside a character 's head except through witnessing acts and listening to this is true of all of mccarthy 's work he writes in essence beautiful screenplays stories that are told in carefully controlled images and well honed and realistic dialogue director thorton and screenwriting tally make the huge mistake of trying to give this film a literary '' feel most certainly they were overwhelmed by the beauty and the poetry of the descriptions of place and action offered in the novel and i suppose some of the choices they 've made were out of a kind of panic damon who is too old and earnest in the wrong ways for the part may have been likewise intimidated by the source material and decided to make the character his own as opposed to mccarthy 's the grady of the novel is not one who is just pure and straightforward rather he is a character at odds with the darker ways of the world for it can be navigated only through careful use of reason and he is a character who does n't just choose to remain more true to his feelings but who can hardly help it a character emblematic of a stubborn type of innocence that carries with it an infectious aura of see it and its consequences later on in the third book of the trilogy cities on the plain to create a work film which does n't understand and showcase this trait is to do not even the minimal of justice to its source a good film can be made of mccarthy 's work it will take boldness and a screenwriter and a director who realize that the poetry of the prose can only be the poetry of the cinematography and that beyond that the plots and what they represent and the efficiency of the dialogue is enough maybe even more than enough
after 40 minutes of objective viewing and shot after superfluous shot i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from kong is not an epic it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing if you will but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this jackson no more 'epic shots please
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ! peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
i had higher expectations when i purchased this dvd i was not disappointed technically but i was extremely disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of rachel york she could n't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop jazz or traditional musical theatre sound her voice was all over the place furthermore i found her character very annoying she was screechy and not at all vunerable i preferred kathryn grayson 's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable witty and charming as well as screechy demanding and somewhat tyrannical truly i could barely watch this entire video and at the end i could have cared less if fred and lilli got together i think that was the most powerful statement for me the production was acted or directed with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top can today 's directors please leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves everything need not be a commentary ! i wish i had seen marin mazzie because i heard she was incredible rent this before buying it or better yet do what i did and buy it used it hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth
imho none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with howard keel kathryn grayson etc these shows are all about the music if the music does n't make it the whole production is n't worth two cents
my enjoyment of the pbs telecast was just fitful the production itself was just breathtaking faithful to the time period expensive detailed and colorful the costumes were of a quality one rarely sees anymore imaginative designs the attention to detail and color coordination was all beautifully done the two stars brent barrett as and rachel york as are both handsome exceptional in this regard and looked their parts to the hilt york especially looked like a lady of the theatre while barrett really does look like a matinee idol i was far less pleased with their performances and singing it 's not that i do n't doubt their talents they obviously have star quality but whose idea was it to have fred and lilli behave like spoiled bratty whiny children the kind you see on tv sitcoms immature silly and really really these two were quite unsavory ridiculous even unsympathetic characters everything was way furthermore all of the constant mugging overacting excessive broadness and exaggeration of expressions wore thin after a short while rachel york repeatedly screamed shrieked yelled caterwauled and went beyond behaving like a mere shrew the show turned into the screaming of the shrew this lilli had no sophistication class dignity warmth irony or even wit even her sarcasms and irascibilities were all wrong too she was a harpy and little else brent barrett was a little better but he still came across like an excitable high school kid fredric graham should be a actor type albeit vain hammy insecure and prone to an inflated sense of his greatness but a child he 's not fred should reek of martini and savvy and sophistication yet edgy rattled in a way only overambitious actors can be it 's strange seeing barrett this tall athletically built actor made to behave like an overgrown teenager sort of like one of those men depicted in sitcoms childish and an irritating even his speaking voice as used here when under pressure cracks and acquires that think tom cruise when he yells he 's not anywhere believable as an aspiring classical actor i had even more misgivings about york 's and barrett 's singing yet i ca n't blame them exactly very few people on broadway nowadays exhibit the kind of fundamental classical training that was obligatory at one point i could n't tell whether york knew what she was doing her singing displayed a combination of pop vocal crooning along with some jazzy inflections yet there were hints here and there of some operatic leanings as a result none of her songs coalesced properly it seemed as if each register wherever the song in question took her revealed a different kind of stylistic realm barrett again was a little better but he too lacks a truly fundamental technique the middle part of his range seems natural and easy but the higher he goes the tone spreads and sounds constricted all at once you ca n't take a pop voice production of tone and expect it to bloom properly moreover barrett was often afflicted with a troubling vibrato from what i can hear when he speaks properly there is quite a beautiful resonant voice in there somewhere but he 's misusing it at practically every turn a digression watching howard keel in the film version i 'm more convinced than ever that his performance as is the classic embodiment of the role in every way keel was among singers an outstanding instinctive actor and brought to the role the kind of distinction it required it did not hurt that he was tall distinguished and imposing he looked great as petruchio so shakespeareanly dashing keel 's fred graham was exaggeratedly vain ambitious and yet somehow mature and imbued with depth barrett did n't even begin to convey these latter qualities and keel 's voice deep vibrant correctly produced and gorgeous in tone quality was one of the best of its kind for the baritone roles to be had his accounts of the songs are matchless more troublesome though was how york and barrett interpreted their songs even the simplest melodies were tugged pulled underlined and bent out of shape as though to make the audience understand every little inflection and bring across the mood with all these exaggerated '' espressivo '' effects but all these gimmicks and schticky touches ruin the songs i hate men '' was the most idiotically overacted spectacle i 've ever witnessed wunderbar '' is a beautiful melody whose words are parodical yet the tune in its beauty should be retained and preserved york and barrett tried to make the song the magical moment it can be but their voices did not blend and the song failed to surge as it should as alfred drake and patricia morison made it so ditto for so in love '' still a bit overemotive and swoony by york though it was mercifully spared from being mangled in this production barrett came closest to producing the most moving moment near the end in this tune for the most part though most of the songs as performed here did n't work for me porter 's music was poorly represented the voices did n't serve the score and porter 's lyrics were banged up and slammed in every which way and loose one of the pleasures of the two original cast albums the first in mono the second done especially for the stereo era was lisa kirk 's lois kirk brought a special brand of street smart sultriness to the role helped by that deep knowingly sensual timbre she owned her renditions of lois 's songs are dynamite are broadway classics and what 's more made the role into a real character not just the secondary comedy lead it made for a terrific contrast to patricia morison's lady of the theatre voice and personality nancy anderson in the pbs telecast was made to embody a completely different lois altogether and i hated it lois was here into a dimwitted kewpie doll she spoke and sang in a pinched '' girl '' tone and so the songs failed to come to life the rest of the cast did fine the too darn hot '' number was wonderful spicy insinuating and catchy but it serves little point in analysing the other factors because the main elements were too compromised for me to enjoy the show as a whole
i was very excited to see this having seen the original cast lead by marin mazzie and brian stokes mitchell on broadway for some reason the energy of this cast does not transfer into the audience brent barrett i 'm sorry to say is a sad replacement for stokes nancy anderson who has been wonderful in other roles is squeaky and annoying in this one the one reason i 'd give to watch this is rachel york who seems to be perfect in just about every role she takes on i saw and loved marin mazzie but rachel york can certainly hold her own she has a wonderful voice amazing comic timing and is quite beautiful on top of it all she embodies lily vanessi brilliantly in this production it 's just a shame that her fellow ca n't do the same
this was a terrible production with no life and seemed jumpy and disjointed it also felt thrown together and not well rehearsed with number dragging on longer than they should and others rushed rachel york was ok she was better in scarlet pimpernel but this is not her best performance at all all in all a disponting version and hard to see how it won a tony for best then this is n't the original cast from that tony winning revival so that may be the problem
i was surprised at the ending of this film that i did n't see the above caption at the beginning of the film this movie to me was comparable to american television movies where something terrible happens to a family and how they cope with it it was an italian film but on the whole it was of the same viewing quality as these movies maybe a little less slick in appearance also some of the scenes were so banal like just before the boy drowns a sense of danger is created by the girl on the moped kicking one of her friends on another moped the close passing of a truck as the father drives to his patient etc or when the boys ' casket is nailed shut and is screwed shut interchanged with images of the mourning father how fat can you lay it on especially the beginning of the movie is excruciating a very portrait of the family if they were black they would be called the huxtables this is of course to offset the second part of the movie with the first first routine and happiness the second chaos and sadness the above are just some things i noticed about the movie which did n't make sense to me i wo n't even go into the storyline which is rather unplausible at some points even though it is completely predictable what bothers me most though is that all of this must have been done on purpose but why the end result is a bland film which may have been made with a lot of care but just does n't come across this is the first movie i have seen by this director i have heard that his other movies are better i hope so because this film has n't made a great impression on me
i have to agree with the other reviewers legend of the rangers '' looked promising but ultimately did n't deliver the sets and effects are excellent and the actinng 's not bad and of course it was great seeing andreas katsulas reprise his role as narn ambassador now citizen g'kar however these three elements could n't save the film the mysterious alien race threatening the liandra 's crew were too much like the shadows of the series if you 're a fan you 'll want this film but if you 're looking for an introduction to go with the season box sets not jms ' best which is sad because it had promise
i loved and crusade i hated this well maybe hate is too strong a word i strongly disliked it i 'm gon na make this short and sweet the plot stunk the idea a race as old and powerful as they presented in the pilot could 've gone by the first ones '' and not have an influence in the shadow wars of the original series is completely ludicris to me the acting was far from normal universe quality that hologram targeting system thing was totally and completely disaterous gawd awful ! ! ! the story never went anywhere the whole time i was waiting for the movie to progress it never did the special effects where fantastic though work there
strengths soundtrack by christopher franke performance by andreas katsulas in half interesting idea of weapons system weaknesses plot was mostly stupid tragic underutilization of g'kar as a character in the second half unconvincing sense of scale for the leanndra why call for a healer '' how many healers are on board this tiny ship felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie
this movie '' which was obviously meant to be a pilot but was aired as a feature lacks nearly everything that made babylon 5 a great show it 's set in the same universe and contains the same races and ships but the plotting feels like well a failed pilot g'kar 's scenes in rangers '' are an embarassment to the character after a spectacular sendoff on the original series he the universe apparently having regressed two or three seasons ' worth of character development there is no reason for him to be present except to spout off some gratuitous quotes from babylon 5 and remind us that we are watching a show overall this show would be without much value if it stood alone as an episode of the mythos it is worth even less
hi i have not receive my item yat thanks
in my country '' is certainly a well meaning film filled with dignity it means to explore the atrocities committed in the age of apartheid can justice be served can south africa move on how complicit is the average man there are certainly important topics and issues to be dealt with but rarely have i seen them served up so falsely and dispassionately everything in in my country '' is a construct you 've got juliette binoche as the face of white shame samuel jackson as black rage though he 's an american brendan gleeson as the villain binoche 's assistant as the tolerant and understanding african and her boss as the face of white indifference of course this story is told from the vantage point of the white lady and the american as these stories rarely examine issues from the african viewpoint even the testimony of atrocities which should be a dramatic highpoint are so staged so false with the requisite swoons from the audience at shocking '' revelations and binoche is ever present to provide the tears but as the emotion is n't genuinely developed i continued to sit there feeling rather empty at the whole exercise the africans are never portrayed as significant indivduals but as understanding and forgiving souls i 'd have appreciated a bit of emotional complexity at any point ! if the pairing of juliette binoche and samuel jackson seems an odd match trust me it is as characters with opposing views they are put together rather conveniently no actual friendship is ever developed we 're just supposed to take it at face value that these two would hang out together well i did n't believe it for a second it was necessary for the plot so it happened why bother with actual character development there 's a more important message to be delivered by having them debate of course to make matters worse a romantic entanglement evolves there 's not much drama there either as binoche seemingly has an indifference to her husband and children if she 's conflicted about anything it certainly never shows and as if matters are n't bad enough there 's a and obvious ending that is supposed to be a revelatory twist but i can only say it once more without bothering to make the characters real who cares a message can only take you so far i 'd have rather have watched a relevant speech because no one here was concerned with drama
samuel jackson juliette binoche i thought it 's gon na be a wonderful movie to my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen in my entire life a married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she 's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone what a ! hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie won some money with this crap movie by losing their chance to ever film again ! never ever i will watch a movie with samuel jackson or juliette binoche again i 'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of movie '' that wastes your precious time
in my country '' is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting this film based on the narrative writings of stellar south african journalist antjie krog somehow gets a starring duo of a frenchwoman and irishman playing afrikaaners and an american samuel jackson ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky contrived melodrama that never existed in krog 's tale this is most unfortunate because krog 's stories her take on south africa 's truth and reconciliation commission is one that should be heard far and wide unfortunately the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a liaison between binoche and jackson 's characters how did it turn out take a look at the dvd extras samuel jackson is nowhere to be found this is a man who knows quality and knows junk he must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could good move smart guy
i was disappointed with this dvd i usually like all of denise austin 's video workouts so i bought this one for my little sister she was n't interested in it and i can see why everything seems too choreographed and then kids are fake they do n't look like normal '' kids they 're obviously or something i also bought billy blanks tae bo kicks for my little sister and she loved it ! ! i would recommend this dvd if you 're looking for something for a child
i have been buying workout 's with denise austin for years and have been very happy with them however since denise is no longer with artisan she is now with lions gate the quality has changed the camera man ca n't seem to sit still when i buy a workout dvd it 's not because i want to look at a pertty face far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we or as in this case our need to do by the second workout the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow still it is not the quality i am used to from denise it could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment
denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults this video is n't kid friendly and does n't have a good feel for kids to be honest it is very close to most of denise 's exercise videos for adults what denise has forgotten or may have never known is kids are kids and they need to be treated accordingly and that means with exercise videos to a good choice for kids is kick to get fit kids this video is done by a qualified kid 's fitness professional not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids and just hoping they can do them my kids are not at all happy with this program there are 6 10 years old and they were bored turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes mostly because they did n't understand the movements and then found most of the other movements very hard to do once again the forgotten point kids are kids and they need to be treated accordingly one last point in the video denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children 's exercise fitness this is all good except they all forgot one very important detail you must be able to teach instruct children at a level they understand just because you know something about exercise it does n't mean you are able to teach it to children knowledge is one thing teaching instructing is another and the fact is some people are just not very good at instructing children a point that is very clearly displayed within this program
sixth sense unbreakable are so much better than signs and i 'm sorry to say whatever night shyamalan originally had he 's lost when sixth sense came out he was tipped as the next big thing but i 'm sorry to say it 's no longer there in my mind he can not match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of sixth sense signs just fails miserably the concept was a good idea but the execution was terrible it reminded me very much of blair witch project as in what little action there was happens off screen and the torches as well it 's also definitely not mel gibson 's best film even the actors appear to struggle with the script and not really much happens apart from one brief glimpse of an alien oooh fascinating the problem i think that signs has is that it 's already following many other far superior alien movies aliens attacking the earth has been done and lots more memorable than this there 's also the overly religious theme which the film probably would have done better either toning down or scrapping altogether it was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film the scenes between gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy the finale does n't really make the film better the discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious ! why come to earth the surface of is mostly covered in water and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour ! and then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology and then ca n't break into a wooden house ! are you kidding me but the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs who sensed something was not right time to get myself a dog but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment can not detect the aliens entering our atmosphere but a baby monitor can ! huh ! a film to stay well away from thankfully i did n't spend my hard earned ha ! money on it but borrowed it from a friend i shall approach night shyamalan 's films with trepidation from now oh and when a director decides to give himself a speaking role in his own film make it a short one
so alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to well wo n't give the plot away but trust me they 're not here to guests on martha stewart and i find the plot therefore and all of these aliens as terror sources '' movies just can i say this not fair to aliens ! ok i do n't have an aluminum foil hat on i just think its childish stephen greer md 's hidden truth '' book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from hollywood no more friendly types just constantly the message of terror from the skies this trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable and how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie oh you do n't want to
not since sixth sense '' with the most obvious and telegraphed twist have i seen a bigger load of hooey this guys inability to tell a story without glaringly obvious chasms in the plot is only equalled by his obviously tenuous grasp of christian theology and a bit like an o'level pupil writing a thesis on nuclear fission the mere concept of this plot using an alien invasion as proof of gods existence flys in the face of the most fundamental of christian crikey and all this from an
i will admit that paula is inspirational but she does n't give you enough time to learn '' the move before putting you in full gear i loved the music and paula 's upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast this video will definitely get your heart a pumpin'
i rented this movie from hollywood video it was a struggle not to turn it off and watch the news the movie was cheaply made and the acting is mediocre it is insulting to our intelligence by trying to make us believe what is happening could be reality they try hard to conceal the identity of the vigilante for most of the picture the vigilante knows when and where anything bad is about to happen our detective hero finally catches up to the vigilante just after the vigilante wipes out a bad man the detective having the drop on this killer and instead of revealing the identity of this super person says go away there are many sequences just as unbelievable as this
this video left much to be desired the dvd was cheaply made i urge you not to buy this video ! ! this is 20 thrown out the window this video was filmed in someones house i would never buy this if i knew ! !
i did n't enjoy the film i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what 's the difference it 's king lear a downer of a play there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he 's wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he 's an annoyance
i 've had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week it was on tv here otherwise i do n't think i would have watched it my instincts would have been correct an action technothriller stealth has a predictable plot a new elite team of 3 pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots including a disrespect for authority mayhem ensues people die the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence and they work together to save the female pilot who 's gone down in north korea the plot direction and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads josh lucas jessica biel jamie foxx that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart i 'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads and came away disappointed me i was expecting little so i guess my expectations were met though i will say i was amused by the last line
this movie had some good potental in the opening after that it looses all grip on everything the plot of the movie is based on a new jsf style creation fighter and a new vto l controlled artificially by a ai '' one thing leads to another the ai '' goes haywire during a lighting storm it starts acting on it 's own to destroy threats '' one thing leads to another their in tajikistan setting off dirty nuclear weapons north korea russia for absoulutly no reason breaking numerus international laws at one point in the movie the star of the movie falon 1 '' helps destroy intercepting fighters with the ai '' whois hes ment to track down breaking a bunch of laws himself and is treated like a hero at the end it 's a backwards movie do n't watch it please don't
if you have bothered to read all the other reviews here i think you will get the point but still unsure think of knightrider from the sure edi used the same voice ! ! then add some thunderbird puppets thats a bit mean at least they had personality then add a dash of on a budget oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old ! a bit scathing you may feel but deservedly so afraid seriously watch some paint dry for a couple of hours at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz
they call it brainless fun but it 's not even fun yes stealth '' is that bad movie that 's actually so bad it 's no fun it starts out bad from the beginning with an title sequence dating this film in the near future '' which should trip alarms for anybody whose ever watched an episode of mystery science theater 3000 '' the heroes of our story three pilots assigned to fly us fighters called talons '' are reluctantly joined by a fourth pilot a robotic fighter jet called edi trouble starts immediately when edi develops an acute case of and faster than you can say i 'm sorry dave i really ca n't do that '' edi is ignoring orders and raising all sorts of havoc it 's hard to get more specific without ruining the plot because there really is n't any plot the story we see on the screen hints at several different that never form into a single story we have the plot about stopping crazy edi '' the plot about the evil admiral played by sam shepard who will do anything he can to keep the lid on edi when he goes bad we have jessica biel as a fighter pilot running from the bad guys after she 's shutdown over north korea then we have josh lucas as the other talon pilot whose on the run from some goons who are trying to oh who cares none of these plots go anywhere but what about them effex stealth '' offers us hours of aerial dogfighting in unsurpassed cgi unsurpassed because the movie demonstrates that there are some things that simply ca n't be left to computer animation even though they 're next generation aircraft the talon fighters never convincingly look like any airplanes and the aerial effects here look little more believable than those done over 20 years ago in firefox '' or deal of the century '' or nowadays on any flight simulator game run on any the effects compound the error by maximizing use of impossible shots '' shots that could n't be seen by a human perspective such as those that cut across the sky and directly inside the subject aircraft it 's a clever shot but not a terrible smart one they never stop reminding us that these are effects it 's probably too much effort to explain that even elite fighter pilots do n't want to be confused by a flight panel that suddenly starts broadcasting images of a bunch of terrorists sitting down as if for a cnn or that none of the pilots come off as even casual aviators stealth '' is one of those mindless movies that effete snobbish reviewers like to blame on teenage boys but this flick lost a ton of money stealthy profits which is only strong proof that the monster audience of mindless boys is itself a delusion of these frustrated critics and studio execs or even stronger proof that those mindless teenage boys may be smarter than anybody realizes
i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance '' never had contestants who mastered it
i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said oh it was okay '' but did n't elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny with jokes or punchlines that fell flat horrible acting totally predictable and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you 're really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then you 'd be better off to go home empty handed there 's not even much eye candy to recommend which is a nice fallback if there 's nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling just because you like a movie should n't mean you give it 5 stars especially when it 's as bad as this one i mean i liked freddy vs jason but there 's no way i 'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars this is bottom of the barrel
despite being a comedy show this turned out to be a rather depressing experience there were a few amusing bits here and there mostly there but the targets of the satire were very lame most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990 's so they are extremely dated the information 411 '' 90210 '' and yakmin shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch as bad as anything on snl i only made it through the first 8 episodes and skipped the last 5. the commentary on episode 8 was more interesting check out garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates sexuality '' i still do n't know what she meant by that than the actual episode as we know ben stiller became a star playing neurotic clumsy nerds andy has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next courtney love in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable and sometimes wretched films even though she does have talent and bob odenkirk did show and recently as of november 2006 directed the awful let 's go to prison the only sketches i remember in which i mildy laughed were the b minus time traveler '' sketch stick with monty python 's flying circus which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy
after seeing some of the other amazon reviews of this movie and the fact that jason swartzman was in it after having seen him for the first time in rushmore '' a wonderful film i had to purchase a copy of this dvd for myself to view it 's got a wonderful cast of fine actors but i found this movie really dumb one critic on the dvd box claimed this was laugh out loud funny '' really what movie was he watching i strained a chuckle here and there but that was about it for me the lily tomlin dustin hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script i know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie but i did n't find much to snicker about
it is a far stretch to call this a documentary '' a comedy would be more appropriate i think there was more scientific fact in the day after tomorrow
hopelessly misguided overwhelmingly biographical smartly directed al gore 's never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on dvd ! beware though that dvd is made of plastic which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including gasp ! oil the recipe for the movie however is 1 part science 3 parts personal anecdotes and 4 parts slideshow fun ! gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus this is of course after he invented the internet on which to start his new campaign for president his movie is almost entirely about his own life a fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science it is n't necessarily bad science it is just far from representational however i wo n't waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by gore there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that what needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary there are components of informative dialogue and presentations but this is really all about al gore not global warming there is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the problem '' this is my big criticism the movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance al gore 's availability for political office even in that light it still operates dishonestly gore chastises the bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming however even when gore was running the country with bill clinton they did nothing in fact gore 's proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get kyoto passed but was stopped by the republicans is bogus the clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables they never even submitted it to the senate for ratification in this fashion the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another in the end the movie is full of misleading science and statistics complete lies and fabrications and it focuses more on the nobility of gore than on any perceived global issue the only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited the message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style it 's just not a message that anyone should hear or trust
when the scientific facts about climate change are seriously looked into the only inconvenient truth is vice president gore needs to find another celebrity cause a passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory it quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late and early did n't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming what should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it 's theorists is to vote for a certain political party sorry nice try al perhaps if you spent more time cleaning up the heavy metal pollution found on your own property you would convince more people
from the inventor of the internet the inspiration of love story the guy on the cover of rolling stone and the winner '' of the presidency in 2000. garbage not worth watching
as an environmental scientist i find these political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful while they rally the convinced having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful to wit about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage about the movie '' it 's actually a filmation of the presentation al gore has made for some time on global warming in it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of and other gasses the audience is bombarded with a long series of charts graphs and suppositions that make for a compelling argument if one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation and this is where this production goes terribly wrong the fact checking was terrible the data was obvious and and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause two examples an inconvenient truth asserts that a rise of 20 feet is a realistic prospect yet the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the western nations warns of rise in the four to 35 inches range in the century gore discusses the earth 's atmosphere as relatively thin and declares that the problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide '' hello thickness has nothing to do with global warming people carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from earth 's surface meaning that the vibration warms the which makes things hotter further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense since it does n't play a role my warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process no matter how noble the cause may be
guess i 'm in the minority about this but this play not a movie left me thinking that i wasted my money i enjoyed madea she is a great character i never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems for me the only thing funny about it was when madea took the stage the rest of it was simply boring
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless
the whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer in short the disjointed story line goes like this troubled teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit whose face resembled iron maiden 's eddie ! who gives him he escapes death a jet engine crashing through his roof because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny he discovers some old hag named roberta sparrow he knew was an ex teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes ' same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected ' are you still with me ! ! ! i love and fiction but all this is beyond ridiculous ! that my friends is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens ' film is about ! i mean 'gigli ' was a better film for chrissakes ! even the time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable in the end the only redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like the church duran duran joy division and tears for fears hardly enough to save the film though if you must rent 'dd ' if your curiosity is piqued but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your or your parents ' money

this collection is more of a documentary on the history of steel cage matches in the wwe the documentary itself would be okay for a television viewing but not a slightly overpriced dvd that advertises itself as something that it is n't there were some matches that barely had any blood if any up and beyond that most of these matches could almost be considered match ups as far as quality one that that was upsetting are that there are no wcw cage matches circa 1990 on the disc wargames in that era were the only place a wrestling fan could find great bloody matches guilt free it was rare to see blood on wcw any other times but when you did it was well worth the wait i do n't even feel this is worthy of a rundown if you find it cheap used definitely pick it up but i 'd recommend waiting until it 's in the 3.99 bin at your local pharmacy
the original british series the office like watching a clever intelligent and hilarious comedian robin williams for instance perform a monologue that is so funny and satisfying you 'll wish you could replay it forever in your head watching the profoundly and tasteless version of the office like listening to a teenager who thinks he 's robin williams tell a fart joke you 'll wish to get the hell away from him after about two seconds what is it about the united states that we ruin everything this series is obnoxious it 's annoying and i hope it dies a painful death
cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
if you love your dog and wish to truly earn his respect and trust please resist the pull of the glamour and glitz of milan 's shows and do n't bother buying this book his very basic premise of exercise training and love remain the only idea i agree with as a trainer and behaviorist myself milan ignores prevailing research by using his forceful choke and drag '' methods these methods can create different problems ultimately compare this book to positive perspectives love your dog train your dog by pat miller you will create pets through a form of benign leadership clear communication love and trust to form a willing relationship using miller 's methods patricia mcconnell and karen london phd have written many fabulous and informative books on training and behavioral issues such as the cautious canine feisty fido i 'll be home soon way to go ! and feeling outnumbered these books are short easy to read and packed with lots of useful realistic tips if you truly love your dog please stay away from this book
being a fan of cesar i expected something new and informative this dvd is nothing more than a bunch of selected episodes from his series so if you already have his episodes on dvd do n't buy this unless you want the episodes on one disk
if you want to see milan demonstrate his personal rapport with animals this dvd will fill the bill however if you are seeking advice and instruction on how to overcome aggression in your pet this dvd will not be of much help the dvd is really nothing but an infommercial praising milan 's talents i seriously doubt that the dogs he works with in the dvd maintain their behavior after he leaves the strategies he uses such as having the aggressive dog walk beside his pack dog are not practical for the average dog owner if someone were going to hire milan as a personal dog trainer this item would certainly serve as a recommendation but it is woefully lacking as instruction on how to overcome aggression in a dog
this was a mess this movie gave me the feeling that i was was watching a really bad made for tv film i was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was everyone just seemed like they were through their roles viggo mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan all in all this film was predictable formulaic and a bore please save your money for something worthwhile
i wanted to see this film in theaters i am a cronen fan i admit i was n't really a huge fan on viggo mortensen i never read the book but somehow i was drawn to this film indirectly so i wait for the dvd which is n't such a bad dvd as it is a film firstly there are no surprises any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer the dvd cover or the dvd ad viggo 's performance as a whole was n't too shabby ed harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie so in this small secluded town tom stall aka 'joey turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero although it turns out tom stall was n't much of a hero as he was a villain that 's about it the movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet the sex scenes felt out of place more than anything i could n't stress that enough i 'm going to be blunt they are too random they are in bad taste they are uncomfortable they are very much disliked by me personally and finally the ending the ending was probably the most empty finish i 've ever witnessed tom stall goes after his brother takes care of him drives back and sits down for a nice meal with the family three words fade to black i give this movie 2 out of 5 stars for two reasons some of the action scenes were interesting and ed harris i would not recommend this film
if there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was history of violence '' on critics top ten list everyone was talking about the performances of viggo and maria and ed so i went into it with high expectations honestly it was n't horrible but it was n't worth all the worship that the hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either the story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of ed harris who in my opinion had the best performance overall ed fogarty is in the mob and seems to think that viggo tom is joey cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge tom and his wife edie played by maria bello have two children a farmhouse and a diner and tom insist that he is n't joey the story goes on dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex maria bello has never been one of my favorite actresses i think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair evidence is in the movie she brings the level of believability down and makes viggo 's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent we soon figure out that tom is indeed joey and after we say goodbye to ed harris 's character of which i was just disappointed to see c'mon he was awesome ! goes to see his brother richie william hurt to make amends for disappearing and soon realizes that richie wants him dead so more killing more blood and is finally free of his past if his family would take him back of course they do really his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table his daughter sets a place for him and the movie is over there was no aha moment the action was n't anything new the story was predictable and the setting was been there done that '' viggo is an amazing actor and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into the shift of reality was barely noticeable maria bello needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough sexy stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly it does n't work for her she can not pull it off so i do n't recommend this movie its slow its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be
this movie had a halfway decent set up and good acting but the storyline deteriorated as the secrets were revealed and the ending made no sense that 's 91 minutes of my life that i will never get back honestly my time would have been better spent sitting in an empty room staring off into space at least then i could pass it off as meditating
the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great i 'll try and remember that next time the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward you 'll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it happy viewing
when i first saw the previews i thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie of course i thought the same about white noise i guess the lesson here is that hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end like the sixth sense i think hollywood is more interested in making a good trailer than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office the forgotten is no exception the first half an hour or so is very good and joseph ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from julianne moore and dominic west however the movie quickly begins to fall apart like white noise and becomes less and less believable i was hoping for a logical explanation especially since the box of the movie read the biggest since the sixth sense '' however the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was nothing at all like when the ending came for sixth sense i bought this movie for 2 so i ca n't complain but so much but am still amazed at hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining cohesive movie without so many holes the only thing that is forgotten '' is i have forgotten when creepy psychological movies were good
i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it and absolutely loved it ! it is so smart funny and heartbreaking without ever being sappy so naturally i was curious about the movie too i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too not much could go wrong and while the story line followed the book more or less the movie turned out terrible i could not have been more disappointed ! ! first of all jack nicholson is completely miscast because he essentially plays himself as usual not the guy that mark is supposed to be he is the opposite of charming funny tender lovable somebody that the character of the wife rachel would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely you suspect all along that he is a cad therefore rachel 's utter shock at his betrayal does n't make sense besides he is too old for the role ! meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy but much better in her role as rachel still she ca n't carry the movie alone and her love scenes with nicholson are flat there is no spark there i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel and whether she really did write all the scenes the wedding scene where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing while the wedding guests wait is out of place not to mention boring not to mention heavy handed a total dud
a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron 's husband jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull
this movie made me sick to my stomach here we have a woman like nora ephron a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries she turns into a needy desperate women whom evidently believes her own is determined by having babies one after another i ususally love all of meryl 's movies but i could not stand seeing her turn into a needy always pregnant homemaker '' if i were a man i would have run awary screaming too
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i did n't see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i 'll give it another chance '' bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that 's about as boring as this movie so why the markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time
after reading the reviews here i thought this would be a great quick and to the point workout but that is definitely not the case typically i do the video after already having done cardio so was very irritated to find a long cardio workout before the ab exercises began also she spends too much time giving instructions for each exercise i found myself wishing she would just hurry up the whole time i also bought the 8 minute video series and maybe that is why this one is so disappointing i recommend buying 8 minute ab if you are in a hurry and do n't want to deal with an annoying instructor
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc can turn candy into cuisine
very poor audio quality i still enjoy dan zanes songs on disney channel but this dvd is a different story never played it again ever since it arrived and we checked it out the first day bought after reading other reviews dont know why others are raving about could be his friends
i watched this movie and i have no idea what it was about admittedly it had the usual action movie tropes improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things i 'm a big fan of charlize theron in a sheer body suit lots of explosions a vast behind the scenes conspiracy well that 's kind of redundant most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the imperial storm troopers in star wars look like marine snipers but other than that what was this movie about it 's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes throw them up against the wall see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results what comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand aeon flux '' is plan 9 from outer space '' with better looking actors and a huge production budget well no it 's not even that say what you will about ed wood he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them but it 's doubtful that anyone involved in aeon flux '' viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck and it shows save your money in a few years this will be on showtime late at night as a replacement for beastmaster iii '' and if you 're up late you can watch it then
save your money and time even you like some of the actors the movie is a pure flunk ! !
this movie has its moments unlike most action flicks that tend to boast more action than a watered down story this actually has a story worth paying attention to however it follows the same formula as every other female action movie she 's fighting for some undergroung syndicate the best asassin they have to offer avenge someone 's death and nobody can beat her to include the one 's who might have trained or are equally skilled there are some cool shootouts and fights but i 'm kind of gettin sick and tire of this same pattern if you want a real action flick check transporter
i do n't think these dvd 's are that great i 'm not sure if i just do n't like mari winsor or if i do n't like pilates but i bought these dvd 's and only used them a few times before i lost interest some of the moves are n't that easy and others do n't seem to do anything at all i plan to stick with taibo
the care and attention given to character and relationship development in seasons are gone from silly plots many based on trends divorce rates bored housewives in rebellion aerobics consumerism made my eyes roll the suburban episode was the first asian characters on the series were japanese tourists with big cameras and lo and behold latent martial arts skills that came in handy at the end it 's like season 4 was all about being campy and i missed the good writing it was such a different direction for the show than in previous seasons the romance element is inexplicably headed the character of laura holt has practically become an ice queen and remington is left to make cheesy passes and be happy with a goodnight kiss what was up with in the last season 4 episode meanwhile the writers seemed to turn their interest towards beautifying mildred who has had a fashion transformation she also delivers every time she opens her mouth i agree that the airline and butler episodes were better
douglas as van gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself van gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist 's message like all the great artists modiliani gauguin and van gogh were haunted by the demons of their past which inevitably lead to their self destruction an excellent film to all not just art historians
to violent for anyone ! this movie is horrible the cast is good but the plot stinks ! its just this family who have super powers then this kid wanted to be incredibles side kick in a way incredible says no so then he hates him then the kid turns evil and kills people and wants every body to like him thats origanal there are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes and there is way to much violence killing guns punching bombs and they say stupid words sometimes i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence so i do not recommend this movie to anyone especially the 2 disc special edition !
three problems with this film 1. pacing the film 's pacing does n't vary it 's very boring as a matter of fact this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense speed '' however this film lacks the intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed 2. effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror '' scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting 3. triviality the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the so what '' question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that '' in light of points 1 and 2 this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake do n't waste your life alon
it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification this is a very dull shapeless stilted movie i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds but since it is above all a piece of propaganda i 'm compelled to condemn it as history what it presents is the war between the states '' version of the civil war in which the gallant southerners defend their homes their beloved hills and dales their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north there are only two black characters both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters otherwise slavery is beside the point the generalship of lee and jackson of course is idolized while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools the battle scenes are perfectly predictable guys charge on foot other guys shoot the fields are littered with bodies would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting how real is it to show only one train and that southern in a war won more by transportation than by musketry if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy scholarly book arguing about slavery by william lee miller a professor at the university of virginia it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives over slavery in the years before the election of lincoln the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides blue and grey
it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame it was a mistake to take stephen lang and put him in the role of jackson jackson was considered even by his contemporaries a military genius but crazy by half the film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be shakespearean the prayer scene in the morning puke ! it could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene most of the women '' folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded and i hate to say it but i was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever i was glad to be rid of her her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor i get it jackson was such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual '' give me a break i hate being force feed like that a better director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly then there is chamberlain quoting shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares there is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film i would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been a narrative like gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige if you must see it borrow it rent it but do n't waste money buying it unless it is in the 3 bin at the local dirtmart gettysburg is much better i actually missed sheen and i hate that guy
susan ward coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward then give this a movie a try if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future don '' t find it here
while i was watching this movie i thought to myself am i going to die have i gone to horrible movie hell '' you see i was trapped in a theater it 's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you ca n't leave cause b actors are pretending they can act just because they 're fat the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it 's grossly bright outside and it 's a sunday afternoon and you 're in a car and you 've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape in conclusion this movie turns me into melting snow but i suppose there are worse movies see my review on gummo
when i received this for christmas the year of its release i was unaware of the framing issues i had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements on top of that there were warbling sound issues with part 2 and the michael fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu this was reported on many websites also the trailers were all full screen not widescreen apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 the thing that angers me the most is that since i couldnt return part 1 to universal initially ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen i can live with it in fullscreen and i am not gon na exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with universal thanks for nothing pass this one up until its reissued with new features !
the of this film was potentially interesting but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable one star each for cross and black whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable i would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching melvin goes to dinner
directors actors and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral it 's understandable as it 's a worthy goal 99.5 of them fail perhaps it 's a lack of education maybe it 's poor upbringing that has reinforced and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in hollywood directly leads to this end the only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles and this is not a new concept it 's typically an element of every movie it seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy this falls into the latter category i want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun
i think i 've seen almost everything bob 's been involved with and this just did n't do it for me if you have friends and they are n't complete dullards you 've probably had most of the conversations you 'll see in this movie
i was really looking forward to this i 've seen cheap trick live and they really put on a good show i do n't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio it is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse muffled audio and underpowered vocals i have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert dvd that i 've ever heard i 'm giving it 2 stars because i think it was a good show to see live if you were there but the audio quality or lack of it ruined it for me
let me start off by saying that i have higher degrees in art art history music and romance languages so i am an admitted art snob '' having said that i would recommend that you try the baby einstein baby van gogh world of colors '' and baby mozart '' videos instead of this brainy baby video i find this brainy baby video to be slow boring insipid condescending and visually uninteresting i can not wait to put in something else wait you say is n't this about the baby who is watching it well i first realized that it is truly boring and not just me '' by watching my 's reaction to it she is now 10 months old and still does not like it she consistently snubbed her nose at this video she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do she has never had this reaction to the einstein videos i mentioned i tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better but after 4 months of this approach she still is not interested however the einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning and still do here are the specifics that i think are the problem the visuals are weak and not enough my daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys the female is distracting and annoying rather than engaging and instructional as intended the flow is not as coherent as the einstein videos which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video there is no charm or sense of humor like the einstein videos no i do not have any connection whatsoever to the baby einstein folks i 'm just saying that the brainy baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging if you 're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together
the premise that one could change specific events in ones ' past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i do n't condemn the film 's corollary either that each change produces new unforseeable tragedies it 's the way the story is told its dialogue and plot its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities it is therefore fitting that the director 's preferred ending is included here it is the perfect catharsis for teens who wish i was never born !
the movie starts off very slowly with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher 's character it 's at least an hour before we see the adult kutcher although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene the premise is good and it has some good momentum in the middle which is why i gave it two stars the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done but the overall story line is very weak and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story also the movie has too many references to kutcher 's real life circumstances such as the reference to '' they distract from the story and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle which is too bad if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie skip this one
reality bites seemed fresh when it was first released giving voice to a generation with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of x '' that was overeducated underemployed plagued by the flashy trashy commercialism of mtv and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college it was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass cruel arena of materialism can be tough providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth the very stuff of real movies instead we have a swan dive into a pizza hut commercial held together by a plot so it would have been considered exhausted in 1930. winona ryder is winning as lelaina but one can only imagine the sats of football players at a college where she is valedictorian her documentary '' is appallingly narcissistic reflecting the characteristic gen x notion that if it 's about me it 's art and it 's important '' ethan hawke does an excellent job as troy the very archetype of supercilious entitlement we are expected to root for him but it 's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus stiller who directed a talented fellow almost impossible to look at plays michael the '' smooth successful and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of gen x culture if culture is the right word he 's an executive at an corporation that he improves lelaina 's preposterous documentary '' rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity is the film 's dirty little secret viewers surprised by who wins lelaina 's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and liberace was gay indeed when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie janeane garofalo is outstanding as always and john mahoney shines as the tv morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact a bastard his performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film or on tv than the rest of this film put together in fact reality is great this picture would have benefited from some
many reviewers and critics said it best what do you do when the hero '' of the film ethan hawke is a complete a winona ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give ed wood a run for his money and stiller who is supposed to be the bad guy actually is n't that bad of a human being and winona 's friends are the smarmy arrogant generation x punks who think they know everything when the reality is forgive the pun they do n't know jack past generations would quote tolstoy and shakespeare generation x quotes tv commercials scooby doo cartoons star wars and bad sitcoms generation x is probably the most insincere generation ever detaching themselves and calling themselves ironic '' when all they really do is indulge in pretentious is this film an accurate portrayal of them yes in some ways is the film worth watching yeah at least once stiller gives a decent performance it 's nicely shot and garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth this is probably due to the fact that garofalo actually has some substance herself as opposed to the character she plays check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film
i 've seen ethan hawk 's best performance ever in this movie it was great wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me maybe i 'm not right but in my opinion this movie does not worth to buy does not even worth to rent but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it 's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally it 's worth to be watch once at tv ! by the way i forgot to mention that this movie has a great cd soundtrack really great worth to buy
if this is the generation i am supposed to belong to i want to disown it ben stiller 's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage and are now trying to find their way in the world the movies messege is that we are a lost generation but that is not are parent 's fault where this movie tries to lay the blame the kids in this movie are just lazy more or less and they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives indeed troy ethan hawke even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him winona ryder plays waify lelina who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends one day she meets michael ben stiller who is their age but has made a good career out of the tv industry ethan hates him for his honest approach to life and so the battle for lelina 's love begins i really was n't too impressed with this movie it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool tortured artist when they should get off the couch and go get a job
this movie was terrible went into the theater skepical because i heard that the screenwriters were untested well this disastorpiece is what you get as a result the movie did so poorly that it bankrupted square pictures the dialouge was filled with one liners wasted several talented actors like donald sutherland the drama seemed artificial and the story was just bad what i did like about this movie is that it showed that computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by pixar monsters inc was actually far better than this this movie is just bad it i want to see them make a movie out of final fantasy 6 which was the best of the series in my opinio
the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
my friend bought this set and so i was able to view it before purchasing it myself and i wo n't be purchasing it i had seen the long long trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies i have ever seen one of those films where you ca n't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do we enjoy most of the i love lucy series but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows the aggrivating ones and this film was just an overly long aggrivating i love lucy episode there is funny humor and aggrivating humor '' and this was definitely the type yes it was interesting to see lucy and desi doing films together but overall these films are just tolerable and none are ones i would rewatch for enjoyment too many girls was definitely a b picture really really bad in so many ways poorly written script cheap scenery you never got the feeling they were in college except at the football game which seemed so similar to the football game the marx brothers participated in in horse feathers ! too much partying singing dancing what was this school majoring in theatre and opera it just is a really bad picture yes neat to see lucy and desi and how they met and see them so young together but otherwise a real time waster in my mind the funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra ! of the three forever darling is probably the best but again that seemed lacking '' somewhere the color was that beautiful almost surreal 50 's color that i like the yosemite scenery was beautiful too but i think the angel stuff could have been much better developed he was out of the scene too long at times the part i liked best was lucy imagining herself in the movie with james mason because it was quite funny but the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the i love lucy mold and i was bored with it quickly i know die hard fans of lucy and desi will buy this no matter what and that 's fine but for others i advise you see them first you may like them but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically there are lots better movies out there that i would rather buy ! i rate these 2 stars one star to me is torturous '' to watch these are n't that bad but almost
i am a space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley the cast was solid the director has talent and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well right nope this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense the formula kept repeating over and over something goes wrong houston advises astronauts do something all is well lather rinse repeat boring very boring i never once flet any real tension except for the initial problem '' which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end the problem is that all of the issues '' the men faced were handled so rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked it was just yeah attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened maybe a few times but only for a minute or two some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting how so i must ask nothing really happened it was not emotional at all since the struggles '' of the men were so poorly portrayed to each his own i guess but 4 stars geeez just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks ! the family interactions were pretty standard crying wife kids asking questions annoying media attention etc etc yeah i could feel for the characters to some extent but again this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and special effects too bad i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored not recommended
i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too to this day i pray i do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average again as a who has worked hard to take the right road in life i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race prison sex babies drinking beer young kids doing a drive by mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa please ! ! ! ! wake up ! we need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message what message that doing the things shown in this movie are bad i think we knew that already ! what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual s out there who found the movie offensive edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie adios amigos ! ! !
american me in review lousy predictable story there are two maybe three characters in this movie that have some depth but most are generic sterotypes but since the script has such transparent and worthless dialogue it 's almost not even the actors fault almost i am not a particular fan of this type of movie but if you watch lock down '' you 'll see what a movie in this genre should be after all i 've heard about american me i thought it would be good it was n't even decent and the extras are laughable
slight insubstantial bit of fluff about a young art restorer kate beckinsale a begrimed flemish painting she 's commissioned to clean up and an ancient murder mystery chronicled in the painting and happening again ! ! ! you see the painting depicts a doge playing a game of chess with a knight while the doge 's wife sits at a window and looks on they 're all casting meaningfully sidelong glances at each other beneath the painting is a text in latin asking killed the knight ' as soon as kate starts scraping off the old lacquer and paint that cover the inscription folks around her start falling like ten pins and to ratchet up the mystery some chess pieces are left at her doorstep after every murder naturally the police are ruling all the murders death by natural causes kate enlists a spanish gypsy chess genius beds are hopped with impunity while i 'm wondering why the heck i rented this one in the first place i 'd never heard of kate beckinsale and this one did n't convert me i do n't think it had anything to do with her she has a certain gamin charm and the couple of scenes convinced me her charms did n't stop with her smile the story is so lumbering and hokey though a bad soap opera unnaturally conjoined to a bad mystery that i found it hard to rouse interest between the au natural bits did n't help much that i figured it out before the first chess piece fell either recommended only for beckinsale fans or at least those who unlike me know who she is and are interested in seeing her in an early movie
it 's a real shame complete idiocy that number 1 this show is n't sold as a season package number 2 that they ca n't sell it at an affordable rate for example if there was a dvd that had a complete season for around 20 or a dvd that had the complete seasons for no more than this would make sense it was a great show but come on now lets be sensible reasonable about thi
the best part of my dvd is the fbi warning at the beginning and the theme song i am 4 episodes into to the first dvd and i have not laughed even once the humor is not clever it is chris elliot falling down and hurting himself over and over again or exposing himself to radiation and then someone cranks up the laugh track i liked chris okay on david letterman he was n't the main attraction but his skits there were okay and i appreciated them unfortunately so far in this first season this series sucks it is n't funny it is n't clever the idea behind the series a loser who still lives with his parents and has a paper route has promise the execution is pathetic let me give you an example of one of the most clever things on the show chris falls in love with a gal in the episode and he confides in gus that everywhere he looks he sees this girl 's face gus points out that he has pictures of her put up all over his room and the camera shows lots of pictures of this girl all over his wall big laughs from the audience '' now if that sounds funny to you and put a smile on your face you will love this series later on this gal throws a rock from her window and hits chris in the head again the laugh track is cranked up for me i do n't know if i will watch past this episode there are many good reviews here which are an absolute mystery to me maybe the key is if married with children '' is your idea of high comedy then get a life '' maybe right down your alley notice on several reviews people recall how great this series was when they were 11 or 13 but when they see it again they are suprised as to how bad it is now maybe this would appeal to your 12 year old kid and maybe if your intellect level is that of a 12 year old this could be the show for you friends '' which is not my idea of a great show by the way is probably too subtle for you
this was a very unscriptural movie and a very poor portrayal of king david it was a waste of time professional production work and big name actors do not a good movie make maybe hollywood has its own way of viewing things but when making a movie of a written text as well known as this one it is better to stick to what the text says david did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with goliath he collected them ahead of time the affair with bathsheba was at his idea and initiation not hers he did not have a tantrum when god told him he could not build the temple enough said
i watched about fifeteen minutes before i got enough it was so it was insulting besides that it 's a bore
the real king david was a man after god 's own heart as testified of in the bible but in this movie david is portrayed as self willed defiant and unwilling to be rebuked the movie puts at odds david who is a prophet himself and god 's true prophet nathan in the bible god does send nathan to speak his word and david hears it as such see 2 samuel 12 for a example of david and nathans interaction the message of this movie seems to be 'follow your own heart ' as oppose to what god 's word written or spoken the bible says he who trusts in his own heart is a fool '' proverbs and the heart is decietful above all things and desperately wicked '' jeremiah so my point is do not believe every spirit but test the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world '' and test all things by the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work '' 2 timothy and give attention to reading to exhortation to doctrine meditate on these things give yourself entirely to them that your progress may be evident to all take heed to yourself and to the doctrine continue in them for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you '' 1 timothy
i 've read the other reviews and i do n't know what version they got but the dvd i received has more than a brief scene of david with his wife breasts clearly exposed in bed that scene alone would not be allowed in a movie there is another scene where david is viewing bathsheba bathing she is standing completely nude and you can see everything then the camera pans in close for a waist up '' scene and bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body this is diffinetly an scene this movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed people need to read their bibles before making such a claim there are many scenes that are accurate but there are many that are not one example is that in the movie bathsheba would n't sleep with david while her husband was alive not true in scipture in the bible david saw her had her called to the palace and slept with her then david sent a letter to have uriah killed would of been a decent movie without the smut
oh i forgot everyone in ancient israel spoke with an english accent that 's right this movie is just plain uninteresting to begin with an entirely different actor plays david for the first 30 minutes of this movie he 's supposed to be the young david but when richard gere finally appears as david they look absolutely nothing alike the story just wonders it does n't seem very well directed and i found it very hard to stay interested get david the bible collection '' dvd it is much much better
this movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes i fell asleep several times trying to get through it good sleep aid not such a great film i had way higher expectations from watching the other amazing miyazaki films this movie is n't a bad edition to miyazaki 's portfolio but it 's not even close to his best
elmo 's fire '' is one of those movies that could have been better should have been better and yet it just was n't it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the the brat pack well everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall who were spared this misstep maybe this was supposed to be the breakfast club after college '' but while the breakfast club '' had characters even stereotypical characters that you could relate to there is absolutely no one with the exception of emilio estevez ' character that you care enough about to relate to in this film the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois but georgetown where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college yeah right judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage problem is nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy or maybe it 's just the pearls emilio estevez is a future attorney working as a and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell mare winningham is a dowdy type girl who is still holding on to her virginity working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her she instead fantasizes about rob lowe who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band who has dropped out of school married a white looking groupie had a child with her and has now separated from her and taking up with other groupies demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking has a serious coke problem stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol sounds promising huh well in what is an early portend of the melrose place '' to come sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is dumps his ass immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job estevez after screwing up a lucrative job by hosting a party there travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home lowe in between his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus moore after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother has all her furnishings repossessed loses her job and freaks out not exactly the breakfast club '' the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves with the exception of estevez ' character they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped their every action every line of dialogue seems like just that they seem very one dimensional their angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that winningham 's character could have been salvagable that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was and yet she still gave her virginity to him maybe if winningham was n't so bright or she was a college freshman it would be understandable but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent lowe really had little to do with his role maybe if he had played the role nelson had as the roving lothario with sheedy waiting at home it might have gone over better with his looks it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player moore basically plays herself interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems mirroring her character but was later rehired while the title song later become a minor hit elmo 's fire '' itself missed the mark
of all the hateful characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio macdowell is n't stalking hilarious and is n't kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you 've ever seen i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them all to be friends '' to which they both reply the classic cinema line ehhhh '' wow now that 's drama
this was the movie that gave us the brat pack a staple of a certain cultural set the term brat pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in elmo 's fire on a boozy night of partying since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who were n't in the movie anthony michael hall for example suffered a bit of a ripple effect here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl 's bedroom wall out of all the dramedies of the john hughes movies this was the one i liked the least maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college it was trying to be the next generation graduate '' movie and i did n't relate when my time came maybe it had to do with the fact that i have been let down by many people and did n't have that network of friends in similar situations and the isolation i felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia i guess i was just a little more bitter plus as my life was surrounded by work and little else i did n't have all the dramas going on they did that was kind of sad the one scene where rob lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team it proves you really ca n't go home again and there are some clinging to the past not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties this caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset it 's not a bad story but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold
i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman i also purchased it because of someone else 's amazon review they sounded like they really knew what they were talking about i am glad i bought it used because if it were new i would feel that i 'd been cheated the movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor 's office there was no sense of suspense and i was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea mind you i 'm not the type who requires action and special effects to be happy the dialogue throughout was tedious and trite the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line as well as the director and the editor the plot was in some respects totally illogical and at other times nonsensical even previous scenes do n't tie in neatly enough at the end the plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible the choices the characters make whether restless bored frustrated do n't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film like a greedy unwashed vampire the movie features a wealthy bored couple i was also bored but i 'm not wealthy however ! all the actors did their best within the limitations of this film polly walker was very convincing as a sensitive but hypercritical wife in fact i 'd say she provided the best performance and her character was the most and human they should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character norman reedus was fairly genuine as the young man although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive he failed to grab my empathy which makes the plot of the movie more implausible that a jaded wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment alan rickman did his usual subtle work but it was so subtle that i thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming his attempt at an american accent did not fly too well later in the movie however he becomes much more interesting the end lacked passion and was not surprising at all it was entirely predictable for rickmanistas yes you get to see alan naked so just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy i have always admired alan rickman i 'm a big fan but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted directed film so i give it two stars
maybe it 's just me but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene '' convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very film and the dialogue is not enough to carry it off
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done my review focuses on one aspect of the film indeed one character that of martha martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck even the film credits include the nickname ' besides the character 's surname evidently feeling the need to labour the point portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student later when the cult status of the ' that is murdered students becomes apparent martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic but her attempt is shown as a failure at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled in an electric wheelchair ryder 's character having finished her voyage of rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun the image of martha in her wheelchair an object of pity for ryder and for the audience signifies to us fears of being different of not being beautiful of not being loved and respected martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker and though some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both we may yet still fear martha and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own even is in physical and social reality we are more like martha for this reason ' fails as an exploration of the ' of high school a description often used by firefly 's joss whedon those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ' as the protagonists probably the majority of us ultimately may find the subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow leaving a bitter the way ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers sadly this is happening even today in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' to quote paul campos and even at best it is lazy
the move is one of my favorite films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it
this dvd gets only 2 stars because the tv screen format of this dvd production is really ridiculous but the movie is one of my favorites number 4 on my all time best movies list the feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70 's sci fi movie like 'andromeda ' than of a 60 's movie austere and unemotional like colossus himself quietly and punctuously narrated minimalistically acted and with minimal action a movie for the brain as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world i like the outdated look of the technology in the movie screens led displays printout terminals etc really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60 's and then fears of computers surpassing human beings attention ! spoiler ! the movie has no happy end the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end just as it is in jones ' novel 'colossus ' on which the movie is based and that 's another reason why i like the movie so much one of the few movies without a forseeable and boring happy ending the absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending by the way contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer this movie almost has the quality of a kubrick
ok i 'm a scifi fan i read the scifi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me and it really was good right up to the end just one problem they forgot to write the end what happened did they run out of money did the writer write himself into a corner there was no climax conclusion or resolution you can argue till you are blue in the face about pan scan '' i prefer movies with an ending if you are looking for a great unfinished story this one is for you
i used to be a step aerobics fanatic i am just now progressing from my physical therapy into a more normal '' workout regimen after herneating a disk in my lower back last year and thought this video would be a nice compliment to my elliptical workouts while i thought the lower body workout was solid i thought the upper body workout was mediocre and i was disappointed in the abdominal exercises i thought it was bad form to encourage beginners to hold on to the back of the legs for crunches most of all i would not recommend this workout for anyone who has experienced a major back injury in the past i followed all of the instructor 's directions for beginners and am currently in the most back pain i have experienced since last august
im really astounded by how well this movie has been rated i love depp and i thought it was terrible i think he wanted to do something a bit different and dark but this movie is just sort of pointless it 's about the english restoration and the rebirth of the theatre during a time when sex and murder and general taboo subjects were unacceptable but rampant it takes the nature of the period to the extreme and was overall terrible it acted like it was very profound but conveyed very little it had potential to be an incredible movie but if you 're looking for a depp just pick up something else
i found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent it should be rated i did n't know johnny '' could stoop so low it made me want to barf ! !
discala was emotionally and physically to play an allegedly desirable woman she would however be perfectly cast as a shallow narcissist oh that 's right she has already scored that role on the sopranos
the film opens with three men arriving at a house they draw their pistols and rush in shots are fired and tuco escapes then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house searching for jackson '' he learns the new name of bill carson '' they were part of a gang of robbers there is an exchange of opinions shots are fired the bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss and perform another job next we see a wanted man captured by three men another man shows up to eliminate the competition like a lion driving away hyenas the wanted man is turned in for the reward but his hanging is prevented and he rides away to be recycled can you believe this tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him the tables are turned this is like a cartoon just like it looks like it is over for blondie '' a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story ! a dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll now tuco must care for blondie '' because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure as they ride away they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them the gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms another joke now they are prisoners and sent to a camp was there really combat in the southwest this film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters tuco manages to escape from the train later blondie '' escapes and they meet again there is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal they arrive at a huge cemetery much too large for the small town shown in this film obviously staged and so there is a showdown between the good the bad and the ugly scratch one rival the film ends with a sick joke about hanging i wonder why some people rate this film highly the vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language is n't it funny the most interesting part is how a style western was created by europeans after they became obsolete in hollywood not that they ca n't do better
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was too much blood killing and the like it was totally historically inaccurate and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his yet he does not even load either time and somehow without even aiming the canon he knocks his 'friend ' off his horse the movie is a failure crappy junky just plain dumb stupid pathetic i am not going to waste any more words on it just you do your money do n't buy it it 's not worth 50 cents
yeah ok ice cube is a bounty hunter and mike epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys am i right on that right the story is great but not that great so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky thats what it was like for me folks god i almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this for cube and epps and eva mendes fans only and if you wan na see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it then this is the film for you
although i knew this movie might not fit my expectations i still ordered all three parts in a box from british amazon much because of its cult status among horror fans actually i wanted to watch this since i was a boy and i was right as well as many reviewers i mean about expectations it 's alive '' appeared to be rather boring and not scary at all the only pluses i saw in it are great work by john ryan i always adored him and that nostalgic feeling i got while watching and by nostalgic i mean the epoch of itself shown in the film and the way movie was shot nowdays we used to see monsters from the first minutes on screen and in it 's alive '' we get to see the evil baby just closer to the end anyway i think the film lacks some brutality and real horror maybe they 'll come up with something more infernal in the sequel which is being planned as i heard but in general it 's alive '' is quite ok for a low budget movie that does n't claim to be a masterpiece of horror genre buy it if you like old cheesy horror films especially those which became legends a long time ago
babies do n't scare me except when i have to change a dirty diaper the storyline of it 's alive '' simply did not interest me and i found myself bored bored and bored i do n't think this storyline works very well and as a result i think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie if you want to make this into some kind of a politically motivated flick as a reviewer mentioned above that is fine but that 's the only way anyone would be able to read any interest into this plot because the actual movie itself for entertainment purposes is sadly inept
okay it 's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis on the other hand the film lacks true suspense i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum the pacing is too slow at times and it just does n't stand up that well today the actors who took part in this did n't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel why there was a sequel is beyond me i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time at the most this is a rent not a buy i guess good for it 's time but perhaps a would pump some needed life into the story
this 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover '' and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there 's a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon '' in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks thomas ' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell
this movie could 've been something had they gotten some real actors a script and a director well they did n't and this movie is an embarassment to mankind
i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch '' that is how good it is
this follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic a christmas story '' is a pretty disappointing affair the movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie kiernan culkin and charles grodin taking over for peter billingsley and darren mcgavin were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two mary steenburgen takes over melinda dillon 's role as mom the film deals with ralphie 's young childhood in the 40 's kind of bland and boring if your a christmas story '' fanatic like me you will be disappointed as well it 's not a bad movie at all it 's just not what one would of hoped it would 've been following the previous classic
i own all of these movies already and i can honestly tell you this collection is a rip off they 're asking way too much for so few movies now you add a few more classics and make them all special editions then hell yeah i 'll pay 500 for it but this just is n't worth it collection set or not
this set was produced way too early disney made too few of these sets although at the time it was released only 15 percent of americans had a dvd player to further insult disney fans they put in a stupid sequel i mean come on just put in lion king 1 at least or a movie that was a little older this set should be burned i 'm a collector and i do n't even think personally that it has any collector value as all the movies are being released lady the tramp on and little mermaid so whatever wait for the platinum 2 disc sets i still have my 101 dalmations on laserdisc SMILE
pinocchio 24.50 101 dalmatians 19.99 mulan 22.49 hercules 22.49 peter pan 29.99 lion king not lkii 22.49 lady and the tramp 24.00 jungle book 22.99 little mermaid 18.99 grand total 207.93 all of them are special editions and i 've not the listed reduced private seller price thats the straight up corporate sham price i regularly shop for and i could n't imagine a pretty case with plate gold finish costing more than 80 bucks thats 287.93 you could still take your sweetheart to the movies and benigans for some baked potato soup for this inflated price i 'm not sure but i do n't think this case is platinum makes you look any younger make you fly or will help you sleep better so i think i 've made my point
if havoc '' was anne hathaway 's all '' vehicle she needs to check the engine hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as bijou phillips and joseph in this drivel hathaway and her friends the plc '' as they call themselves are products of palisades in california bored with their seemingly bland lives they adopt the gangsta '' mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize in truth they 're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable posers we 've all encountered this type before you see them at the mall wearing the most expensive rocca '' wear and and fubu '' even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing they think that they have no identity of their own so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be in this tale hathaway 's group has a with a latino gang drawn to these outlaws hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an party hathaway then returns with one of her friends bijou phillips and the two take the downward spiral into supposed gang life in the end however something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang their actions cause a number of things to occur the results of those actions are status quo for their social status although the film is pulled down by a lot of seems to have channeled jamie kennedy 's malibu 's most wanted '' character the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed latino gang headed up by freddy rodriguez first of all i 'd think that a real gang would have taken out the plc '' without flinching secondly had four innocent '' little girls actually made it into the gang 's party i 'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance instead rodriguez backs off on the posers of the plc '' and seemingly falls for hathaway 's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie havoc '' is a dud unbelievable uneventful and definitely a rental
what can i say about the truly inspired film havoc '' that has n't been said before barbara kopple an academy award winning documentarian taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture sounds like a recipe for success ! add a talented cast of appealing actors given really meaty roles awesome ! not so much '' havoc '' is unfortuanately an unmitigated disaster you wo n't believe your eyes the kids the gangs the streets of everything just rings so false the last time i saw so many posers playing '' street toughs was at my junior high auditions for grease '' and i think we could have taken these kids a lot has been made about the shocking '' sexual content of the film anyone shocked '' by this movie probably does n't see very many movies anne hathaway does appear naked which seems to be a selling point but she and everyone else deserves better i 'd actually have rated the movie about a 4 because it 's a campy mess ! ! ! if someone had realized that this was a exploitation flick and sold it as such i 'd have bought into it no though this is a serious movie '' and important '' document of our time sadly on that scale these kids need to go back to school because they failed
maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking but i doubt it since vanilla ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new i went to high school with kids like this and i 've bought the eminem cd and there 's a little more to them than the stupidity but let 's discuss the movie anne hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in east seeing her boyfriend beat down she 's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating then she goes to parties gets into even more trouble and starts losing her jerry ghetto talk the mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there 's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner but well he 's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner actually he 's coming off like a gangsta yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat yes it 's ironic that she 's trying to dress ghetto while he 's trying not very hard to dress suburban wife beater is suburban the movie 's climax is a scene in which anne and bijou ask the guys if they can join their crew '' and if the gang did n't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked they sure have it then and really who does n't know that that 's gang initiation standard started by the hell 's angels in 1965 after that disaster both anne and bijous say no but bijou takes a little more time saying no the movie unravels as anne hathaway discovers her inner white girl and her friends act even more stupid there 's a neat scene between her and bijou philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people but it 's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie the one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate dj squalls ' character from hustle flow and hustle flow in and of itself since that 's a white character in a black world that does n't fall into either extreme of wigger or doogie howser he 's just himself whereever he goes he 's someone the morons of this movie could learn from but really would n't you rather just see them all shot dead
so there i was surfing the net listening to suicide kings in the background thinking okay so i just won the young indian jones trading card set what else should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it ! a ha ! here we go a movie with britney murphy as score ! well i was sadly sadly very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly if you like quirky black comedies this movie is for you but not for me ! sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she does n't want to marry him it all just sucked sean though is still of course sexy sexy ! and so is brtney but i think she looks better as a thin than a baby fat brunette
'if these walls could talk ' was dissapointing it was too disjointed for me to gat any real understanding of the message i would not suggest any of my peers to purchase the dvd
not enough t a for me michelle williams did n't show enough
i know i know elaine stritch is a legend '' she makes sure you know it believe me maybe i 'm the only one in the universe who felt like smacking her but i felt like smacking her she offers a few bon mots about old hollywood and broadway however the rest seems like a vanity piece i got the feeling that she 's been practicing these naked '' little soliloquies for her audience of one in front of the mirror for years maybe that is the point of the show i do n't know perhaps some think she should be humored because she 's 80 but crikey i just found most of it insufferable sorry
the reviewers here are rating the performer not the show stritch looks haggard sings horribly and most of her stories are only interesting to her a dreadful performance all around
we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch can anyone say buzz and woody chicken run the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story 2. how many times can you do the joke worse still is the dialogue the painfully unfunny and the animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another and that once again we see a lack of locations or interest there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest this film is a piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry
and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake the narritor 's voice was monotone i wanted to shout at his pompous snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples with the narritor granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko when you take people on a educating journey such as nine hours long invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying check please ''
i 've been waiting for this season literally for years it contained notice the past tense the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show it was in the emergency clinic in the episode my sister my sitter '' where the scene pans around showing the patients smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down when i first saw that many years ago i literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like i needed a padded room she did n't even understand the joke when i explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of hiding '' the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable this dvd cut has been cut and makes smithers reply about not letting lisa ahead of him make no sense one of my favorite things about the simpsons was that they did n't care who they offended well they went pc and now i 'm highly offended ! if they had n't messed with it i would give them 5 stars or more realistically i would n't have bothered to write this review quit tampering with the show fox ! !
please think this dvd is recorded in 1986. more worse this is recorded as a documentary sound quality is worst after i bought this and dvd of company '' same worst sound quality documentary i suspect the word concert '' or soundtrack '' in dvd title
this is not follies in concert '' it is the reader 's digest version many numbers have been truncated and many omitted most notably waiting for the boys upstairs '' and the road i did n't take '' while the concert itself ran over 130 minutes the dvd is made from a 90 minute video tape include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews and the concert is basically cut in half in addition the dvd is video tape quality and the sound is unstable all in all a very disappointing recording for sondheim lovers
this movie has some great moments that give one hope for what it could have been emma thompson in particular shines in her role as the candidate 's wife however a terribly hokey script full of metaphors about the moon and wild boars characters who are too underwritten to win the empathy of the audience a running time that 's 45 minutes longer than it needs to be and a really really really bad score seriously the worst i 've heard in a major studio release film it sounds like a 's piano recital or something sink this movie into the bottom of the commercial stratosphere most disappointing of all are the two characters the audience is supposed to have the most empathy for there 's libby played by kathy bates whose character trajectory is unbelievably manipulative sadly i ca n't be more specific about this without spoiling a major plot twist '' suffice it to say that filmmakers try to manipulate you into feeling something for both her and her cause not through good writing but through an action that it made little sense for her to take then there 's henry burton the campaign manager through whose eyes we see all of this his innocence and idealism are supposed to be challenged over and over again but the screenplay never presents him with any real moral delimmas instead he gets just a lot of sad music playing over a completely unresolved subplot with his girlfriend a background involving him being the grandson of a civil rights leader that is never delved into and a character that is never fully developed when the credits roll we still have no idea who he is and what it is he stands for and the same can be said of this entire movie the dvd has no extras to speak of just production notes and a trailer that make it hardly worth having a dvd instead of a video characters in this movie talk a lot about the importance of making history the true events it 's based on did in fact make history the fact that this film is actually a fictionalization of the clintons is no secret but at this point i think it 's safe to say that this is one aspect of the clinton administration even democrats do n't want to revist so there 's little hope of nostalgia ever saving this movie from the only spot in history it has managed to earn the ash heaps
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done my review focuses on one aspect of the film indeed one character that of martha martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck even the film credits include the nickname ' besides the character 's surname evidently feeling the need to labour the point portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student later when the cult status of the ' that is murdered students becomes apparent martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic but her attempt is shown as a failure at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled in an electric wheelchair ryder 's character having finished her voyage of rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun the image of martha in her wheelchair an object of pity for ryder and for the audience signifies to us fears of being different of not being beautiful of not being loved and respected martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker and though some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both we may yet still fear martha and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own even is in physical and social reality we are more like martha for this reason ' fails as an exploration of the ' of high school a description often used by firefly 's joss whedon those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ' as the protagonists probably the majority of us ultimately may find the subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow leaving a bitter the way ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers sadly this is happening even today in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' to quote paul campos and even at best it is lazy
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless
the whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer in short the disjointed story line goes like this troubled teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit whose face resembled iron maiden 's eddie ! who gives him he escapes death a jet engine crashing through his roof because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny he discovers some old hag named roberta sparrow he knew was an ex teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes ' same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected ' are you still with me ! ! ! i love and fiction but all this is beyond ridiculous ! that my friends is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens ' film is about ! i mean 'gigli ' was a better film for chrissakes ! even the time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable in the end the only redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like the church duran duran joy division and tears for fears hardly enough to save the film though if you must rent 'dd ' if your curiosity is piqued but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your or your parents ' money
i have to say that i was disappointed with this dvd the variety of dance styles it shows is nice but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful i 'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only dvd i 've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style which i 've become interested in lately
i guess this dvd is okay for learning some basic movements but her technique is off
how high is a film that lends nothing i repeat nothing to the film community at large i have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the cheech chong of the new millennium with the man pairing while most seem to agree that this is a horrible film very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be when i use the word racist i mean that it builds upon the degenerate that african americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society while there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing method man and redman must be to both the film community but also to their own culture i have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films but this one left my jaw on the floor several times the blatant swings at african american stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director jesse dylan but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film nothing was original nothing was exciting was the pairing of redman and method man an idea of comedic proportions i think not as you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought why method man and redman who completely different people were nothing more than the same character in this film with the very subtle hints of method man being smarter nothing could separate the equality of these two characters that is why they failed as a comic team think of matthau and lemmon or the above example of cheech chong what made these teams work while the how high team crashed and burned what worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together but with method man and redman they were the same i was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film what tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive what dylan did to counter the similarity between man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters the jock the frat boy the asian which was again another racist moment and the rich white boy just felt and were old watch college films from the and you will see these same combinations but what makes the films from the different is that they used them with originality how high from beginning to end was anything but original i must admit after watching this film of which harvard was willing to loan their name to i do n't want to go to harvard they should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage how high is a dark spot in harvard 's history do you know what makes it even worse this film was n't even created at or anywhere near harvard again dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film how high has no redeeming qualities ooops i stand corrected the only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when spalding gray spoke how did they get him and fred willard to do this film i have said it once i will say it again some actors just need their bills paid inconsistency incompetence and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud what destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general it is nothing there is no original story at all with how high going to college working for your grades winning over the heart of the president right at the last minute this was nothing short of a cut and paste '' film that had no backbone and horrid acting ! i do not like jesse dylan 's style of directing while i think kicking and screaming is his prized film due greatly to will ferrell all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes the john adams scene in how high is a prime example the benjamin franklin moments is another the unconcluded truth serum '' can be considered another how high was just scene after scene of inconsistency lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated ! i blame a majority of the issues with this film on jesse dylan if he would have tightened the script created unique and '' characters and eliminated the racism he may have had the quintessential weed '' film in hollywood now all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for sad overall this was one of the worst films that i have witnessed never have i been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as i have with how high the actors all around were horrible the story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age this film would never be considered a comedy nothing was funny nothing will make you laugh the only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits the ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life grade out of
to answer another customer yes unfortunately i did actually see the entire movie from hiidious beginning to its aweful end i do so totally wish i could sue the people who made how high to get back the moments of my life wasted watching this dreck ! thank goodness a friend of mine rented it instead of my having brought this trash i might share a movie i loved with people to a point but watching this movie was like taking a late night stroll through solid matter seperation tanks of sewage treatment plant in the heat of a still humid sweltering summer evening not an experience one wishes to relive or share with others generally i do not like druggie movies but i have liked a few car wash which way is up even cheech and chong has more entertainment value than this critter oh i saw the all the black lackeys in the dvd including the harvard token and to that i say one drop of dignity will not put out an inferno of toady stupidity i know humor when i see it i just wish this how high had even the least little bit of humor in it for me to see i even like a good black exploitation movie like i 'm gon na get you sucka '' which has no redeeming attributes but it was farce in weird and stupid way that did not suggest the kind of patently negative message how high touts i often do not go into too much detail about a film because as bad as i might find something i wo n't be a spoiler my tastes in movies and books are generally not the mainstream which is cool by me even if i hate a movie i will respect the artist enough not to ruin a movie for those others who might like it where i come from not being a spoiler is just simple respect likely something not everyone can understand this ranks as the most racially insulting vile stupid dvd i have ever seen the premise of the story is that black people black men in this particular case are so lame loathesome and hopelessly dumb that they can not logically be considered worthy of advancing to harvard or other such ivy league colleges without the help of magical dope '' i honestly suspect the only person needing and using magical drugs was the dope who wrote this dreck only to place this spawn of his profound never ended stupidity on dvd i think less of this foolish dvd than i do those old racist movies that portrayed all black people as simple house boys '' bowing and scraping their way through life with the sole goal of pleasin da masta '' at least older racially debased films lay legitimate claim to being products of a largely ignorant social and intellectual neanderthal nation mired in institutional hate biogotry and oppression what makes this dvd especially bad is the fact that this is the new face of bigoted negativity in our modern age where some hip hop lackey 's gladly take money to create messages that oppress and sell out our own black children the suggestion that black people are by nature of birth genetics alone inferior is wrapped into the core message of this dvd 's storyline to watch this dvd youo must buy into its supposition that black people need magic weed dope or some other supernatural transcending experience to become the intellectual equals of those who attend ivy league colleges which is the very height of today 's more furtive ignorant stupid mindless bigotry disguised as comedy this dvd functions as a racist tool to rob black men of their dignity inner strength and self worth by suggesting as truth the lie that we need magic '' to become the equals of those in this society who are afforded opportunities to acheive great things tell all the dopes who made this racist dvd you are not buying into their bright new package of old tired racist lies preaching the hate filled gospel of supposed inheirent black inferiority by leaving this dvd trash on the shelf to rot please do not buy this racist dvd media tool that insults the dignity and intelligence of every black man that has and will ever live i pray every black white red yellow whatever your race are stronger and better than sinking low enough to buy this racist filth
i 'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia i had not seen this movie as a child those that say it 's faithful to the book must have read something other than lewis carroll 's alice however the kitsch value is considerable cheezy music and costumes pure 1985. that being said the jabberwock was pretty cool in that '' sort of way also the set design was very handsome it 's too bad that the lighting technology of the time could n't have been more varied everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional the film that comes closest to tenniel 's original alice illustrations is the 1933 paramount b w version it 's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on turner classics
sure this movie is a classic but is it any good frankly i found it to be tedious in the extreme it 's certainly pleasant to look at the sets are quite amazing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story as described in detail in many other reviews here has potential as both a thriller and a essay ultimately it is neither the acting is top notch as are all of the special effects those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory in fact all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic but the whole thing never rises to its premise its thriller '' aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed the only key that can stop the nuke ! the resolution is an afterthought a quick fix in the extreme and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is narrowly whew ! averted the characters are thin at best and stock at worst this movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early thought technology would be like in the mid yawn i must laugh at the whole bit it means nothing to the plot and is the ultimate contrivance if a deadly virus actually came back from space there would certainly be action on many fronts with plenty of interesting conflict to go around some people would try to understand it others would want only to kill it there 's some potentially interesting tension right there some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public others would want to warn them again that could have been a good source of tension someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon mentioned in passing but never developed while others would try very hard to prevent that more tension i 'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly scenes which it actually contains this movie is the poster child for boring science fiction and it would not have had to be that way i have n't read the book but i bet it 's a lot better at its core this movie is a boring dud
yeah it 's a bummer that they did n't include hearts of darkness but putting redux and the original together was irresistable although i much prefer the original i was enraged that some idiot decided to put half of each movie on 1 disc instead of the original on one and redux on the other all i can say is wtf ! ! ! if you prefer to sit back to enjoy films in their entirety do yourself a favor and do n't buy the complete dossier it 's such a shame too the packaging was insanely cool
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is cool this time he 's trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film it 's like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the lakers and the staples center get a plug it 's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it as usual uma 's acting is simply dreadful i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad how she became a star '' in hollywood is beyond me she is not attractive nor can she act she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles they call her john travolta is not much better his version of cool '' just does n't do it for me his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes they were so funny i had to see them again cedric the entertainer was also pretty good
the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said hey do n't forget the book ! '' but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit be cool '' provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there 's too little to sustain a feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a the rock does the best he can but again 's a gay bodyguard ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he 's an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman 's performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there 's just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch shorty'again or read cool '
all style '' and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer '' please go away i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over
first off special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality but at least this is better than the abomination that was jaws the only dinosaur movie i can think of that 's worse than this is raptor which consists of parts of the three carnosaur movies cut pasted together it has some redeeming feature in that ian malcom and john somedoy i forget his last name the guy who owns the park were actually interesting characters i guess steve speilberg finally realised that attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey 's rear end about unfortunately the boring stereotypical alan grant was the central character in this if you want to watch a steven spielburg movie that 's actually good watch or something or the lost world jurassic park '' even though recommending a sequel may seem lame the sequel is a million times better than this if you want to see a dinosaur movie then watch either the sequel to this movie or arthur conan doyle 's the lost world '' i would also recomend the 'carnosaur ' movies but i think they 're out of print if you want to see a movie where sam neill plays an interesting chracter watch 'in the mouth of madness ' or 'triangle' but definitely avoid this movie the only reason i even own it is because it was sold in a box set with the lost world jurassic park
the documentary is not free of biased opinions obvious and politicized does not say the all truth
that which is original in this program is biased and untrue that which is true is not original this piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship such as rats lice and history '' by hans zinsser it makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating diamond 's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous national geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this
three problems with this film 1. pacing the film 's pacing does n't vary it 's very boring as a matter of fact this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense speed '' however this film lacks the intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed 2. effects too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions and there is an overabundance of imaging the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling horror '' scenes furthermore they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole the upshot the film relies too heavily on the art of editing to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting 3. triviality the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the so what '' question the viewer is left with a sense of i sat through the film for that '' in light of points 1 and 2 this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake do n't waste your life alon
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information and to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond we are truly in trouble the truth is out there and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd but this dvd is maybe worth a glance but not a long hard look
one star is evidently the required minimun this documentory in my opinion distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda if you are looking for the truth you wo n't find it here there are people who by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other americans spread for one or more reasons for personal or political agenda or both in some cases such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country this is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent americans consider as evidenced by the nature of their words acts and reasoning they have a right say their piece and present their documentary regardless of their motive caution beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives ! when a person organization or government wants to see america harmed and americans dead i being an american consider their comments as a serious threat to americans american interest and america 's security americans who doe n't consider such declorations as a threat are either people or my enemy there is no third option
in 1998 clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction terrorist are americas greatest threat clinton swept the first bombing of wtc under the rug the failed the american people numnerous times america fights terrorist who are the true infidels they will kill behead drag our bodies down streets every chance they can many are in total denial of how terriorst in iraq iran syria and other countries are it is amazing how americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies terrorist
cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich do we wait until then to change the moral that 's pathetic and so is this movie
man ! this movie is soooooo boring i literally slept through this movie if i die not having watched it again ill be happy i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs old but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wan na cr
this is horrendous movie i will never claim it as the movie of my generation it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the 80 's '' the others are breakdancing the yuppie lifestyle power hungry women with manly handshakes new wave music and junk movies like this i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself and what he can get out of life he ridicules his friend because he 's sick and does n't feel like driving ferris around especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for it was a good day '' i do n't care what decade it was or what was cool back then or now manipulating your friends is not '' i repeat '' not '' cool i know with john and johnette public this is something of a sexual relase i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny
a tribute is defined as a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude respect or admiration '' that is what you have here but if you want a true picture of that incredible morning do n't waste your time and money look elsewhere
yes it 's about good fellas '' yes it 's peopled with alumni from the sopranos '' weakly cracking wise and there are too many requisite and cinemagraphic moments the plot is pretty weak the downloading of money from a satellite requires a great deal of imaginative assent the development of the story is uneven and the acting is transparently bad on not just a few occasions still the provenzano shows flashes and this would have been a very good project for a cinema student is that what it was what you have to like about it is what he tries to do not dislike what he does n't do provenzano occasionally gives us just now and again the atmosphere of the but these are far far better than any portrayed in the sopranos '' the dedication to business the rock mentality the utterly cold sides that appear inhuman in short the other '' side of the human coin are nicely revealed in some very chilling scenes uncle ordering the death of his nephew 's friends before his eyes johnny irish bashing heads or killing the torture scene to paraphrase tessio in godfather i '' nothing personal just business '' of course it has been alleged that the members of the underworld carted away and sold much metal from the wtc towers in the immediate aftermath of just business '' thus there is none of that revolting soap opera component that is increasingly dominating the sopranos '' has become indeed the sopranos '' jumped the shark many moons ago so try this one on for size sure its production values are poor some scenes are painful you keep comparing to other but there are some hidden gems for those who look yeah i agree johnny irish was a good character the fbi guy however was agony to watch two stars for effort and for promise serious cinema students should check out provenzano 's next
when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media
would that the bard himself had directed ian contorts and convolutes judi despises and denies the whole stage to television adaptation loses the gripping starkness of the theatrical intent brits being brits bringing the bard to the modern masses how more cliche can it get in 1976 this may have seemed the definitive version and lord knows it made mckellen and dench but i still hold out hope against hope that an actor and actress will come forth and give this play the truly powerful pitch it deserves for the pallette of film
splendid actress judi but she 's no lady macbeth judith anderson got it right ! mckellen wanders about helplessly
this has got to be one of the most horrible macbeth adaptions i 've ever seen first of all there are no real sets most of the time the actors are performing in front of white and greyish backgrounds this also seems to me like one of those shakespeare adaptions with actors playing the lead roles who 'd probably say we 're playing these parts just because we can '' i mean their voices sound wonderful and very appropriate but they do n't really look the way you 'd expect a medieval scottish king and queen to look too modern in appearance actually some of the costumes in this performance seemed too modern also i have to touch on this because he 's my favorite character banquo in this production was absolutely horrible ! he looked too old for the part i imagine the actual character as being in his mid 30 's to early 40 's and most of the time sounded dark and menacing not at all like the innocent banquo from the play another thing which i knew was coming since most people producing prissy costume drama macbeths believe the theory that it is merely a hallucination is that they cheated us out of seeing banquo 's ghost ! not that i really cared to see what it 'd look like in this version but still rrgh ! what is it with the whole thing it does n't make sense since the goings on in the play were supernatural enough to include a real ghost but i 'm getting are n't i anyway i would not recommend this version as it is a perfect example of something i really really dislike the stereotypical fancy shakespeare
well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy '' or out of the ordinary '' or made by that great director '' its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless the movie is about incest it is about sex and adolescence and ironically it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews the best part of this movie is eva green or more precisely eva green 's body i did n't care about her acting i thought it was mediocre i just sat there and drunk her body in wishing that i was that lucky actor whats his name again the only reason to watch this movie is eva green if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation then i am glad it happened the movie is visually rich in fact its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see but i will take it he captures and celebrates eve green 's stunning body every square millimeter of it including her genitals the movie is for a reason to perfection other than that there is nothing else in the movie the story is utterly insipid the old movie clips the discussion '' of morality or whatever nothing interesting the music is another plus point bottomline watch it for eva green 's body it deserves five stars but the movie deserves only two
despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie this is really pretty sick stuff with little or no redeeming social context objectively sick just is n't erotic no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so those who think differently really ought to either a focus a little more b examine their true motives or c get a life
having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie 's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater can not communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he does n't use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who is n't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but is n't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
jack is obviously not well ginger 's kit sounds like an 80 's pop band and eric should just throw away that awful sounding strat ok we ca n't have a replica i know eric 's choice of notes is just not as good as it used to be he was way more adventurous back in the day no more of the lyrical phrasing the calm excitement and melodies under extreme pressure all gone and replaced with just going through the motions i hope jack and ginger make a buck out of it they certainly deserve it the music died the day clapton picked up a stratocaster he never really bonded with it anyway it looks like a lounge band playing covers very polite and laidback and nothing new to say
whatever ills are in the world it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided and totally movie for example instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and if they chose that job freely it must be their best option no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise as opportunities increase over time by having more corporations and not less to create more competition for these people 's labor and as the country becomes wealthier these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where labor laws at the urging of the un turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs as sad as it may be were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process but all the industrialized nations went through that process shortcuts '' usually produce results which are even worse however the results speak for themselves in very short period of time for example hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china india and around the world thanks for the evil '' capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also cost of living is very low there so these pennies really can go a long way do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people i guess to let people starve to death then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes and may act like a separate being '' as far the law in concerned but does a corporation have a nose feet stomach can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis of course not than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it several of the main spokepersons '' in the movie chomsky michael moore rifkin and others are renowned for their comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie you 're basically bombarded by arguments with very little of the other side presented despite the director 's claim of the opposite claim it 's more like 80 -20 just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes hey let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! dvd players or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need chomsky of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want according to him he says that you should do more important things '' like perhaps studying lingistics which he teaches but which very few care about the movie does make some correct and good observations especially regarding polution however i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the government do so many things for private companies with public funds just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies forbid government corporate welfare of any kind forbid subsidies to companies cut the suffocating red tape and regulation esp in developing countries but in the west too cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing give people all around the world a better life increase competition etc if these and other governments and not corporations ' problems were eliminated the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to century rural lifestile spoken about with much admiration people with no understanding about economics how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for
this documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies by law have an obligation to their stockholders rather than to society at large but this is n't the only case where 'people ' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities what about doctors when a doctor treats you by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you should n't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way should n't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you and what about accountants and lawyers every time an accountant handles someone 's money he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person 's life savings and give it to charity it 's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests what about the greater good and your lawyer should never act mainly for you each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally rather than giving special emphasis to her own client let 's get serious in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy it must first meet all obligations to others or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line as an ongoing business companies have reason to care about their reputations about earning loyalty from their employees etc yes some companies have done bad things just as some people have done bad things can every single person be condemned as a psychopath simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths corporations like people can do harmful dangerous things there 's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred but it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations just as it regulates people the example of bolivia where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater is an example of the failure of government why would the government give such rights to anyone even itself but when government regulation has been adequate privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous corporations and individuals should be regulated by governments if outrages are not detected and punished then government has failed but we should n't abolish government or corporations or people simply because none are perfect we should 1 hold governments accountable for performing their role 2 hold corporations accountable for legal violations through fines and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases as has happened many many times and 3 use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions if you really care about the poor around the world then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs on bad government
there is a lot of traffic in rome especially on the raccordo annulare '' where accidents are also frequent the traffic is noisy and dirty especially when it rains romans swear when they drive and also when they do n't there are many american tourists in rome especially around the fountains in the piazzas where they cluster and sing american songs italian men hit on women tourists who resist their advances se vedi gente che lavora allora non roma '' romans do not work no some of them do and in fact morning till night but rome is not what it used to be everybody knew each other and was polite while now everybody is rushed and rude besides the free love of today has substituted the brothels of yesterday yes some of the brothels were chic while others less so rome was bombed in the second world war in fact bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical performance the public then proceeded to the shelter where flirting and lovemaking would ensue the roman aristocracy is close to the papal court they run parties together even fashion shows cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the pope how to rule the church and yes ! motoryclists can and do go around the colosseum providing a tasteless final sequence one leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time does fellini really have nothing at all to say about the eternal city after all his years there nothing except the standard collection of stereotypes about italians stereotypes that occur in every scurrilous joke that are met on the pages of every trashy guide it is true that there are a few nice sequences especially the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes and then the great anna magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell fellini she wo n't talk to him that is perhaps also a scene worth watching but the rest is commercial cinema vai a dormi ' federico ''
i adore terms of endearment it 's a movie that time and time again has never failed to touch my heart and make my cry i have known about the evening star '' for a long time but i just got around to seeing it for the first time while it was fortunate that shirley maclaine reprised her role as aurora the film did n't have the same chemistry that made terms of endearment such a memorable and much loved film the cast was just off with nobody except for marion ross delivering a much appreciated and genuine performance aurora returns in the evening star as a woman who has been weakened and instead of seeing her as she was and as she was loved we see her adapt to the lives of her loser grandchildren with little contest it 's not the same aurora from the first film the aurora we see in evening star does n't have the same essence of houston class '' the same sharp wit and overall she is a different woman than the aurora you grew used to in terms of endearment watching this movie was painful just because it was so predictable and well it was just lacking that soul that made the first film so special this movie was put together so poorly and it really shows emotional scenes are poorly done because whomever wrote the screenplay really tried to make everything so when there was a crisis it became an emotional spectacle with the entire cast instead of an intimate and thoughtful event between certain characters when tragedy would strike you 'd have a room full of characters you do n't care about dilluting the scene and creating a disconnect in the moment i give the film 1 star and that is only because we get a moment of time with jack nicholson marion ross did a good job and shirley maclaine came back to do her very best under the circumstances these people are the only minute saving factor in this entire upset of a film honestly though if you really love terms of endearment you may find yourself let down by the evening star i personally wish that i had n't of watched it and allowed for the story to end with the first film overall i advise if you loved terms of endearment never watch this film
roger ebert a review i greatly respect and normally agree with raved about this flick roger i love you but you missed the boat on this one i 'm not going to review the plot because it 's been done by several reviewers already suffice it to say david lynch did n't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman english okay class who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig 's head on page 72 in lord of the flies david how about you '' and now want to inflict it on you the unwitting movie watching public thanks lynch but i 'll pass i did n't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of crime and punishment and i did n't enjoy it in scene after scene of mulholland drive to add insult to injury lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense rationalizing it by saying life often does n't make sense this habit of his is less noticible in this film than say twin peaks mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless yeah it 's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life but more along the lines of i would 've won powerball this week except i spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the renfaire what the heck was i thinking '' or i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie what the heck was i thinking '' but i 've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf i must live a sheltered life or something lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his dvd believing his movie must be watched in its entirety or not at all i 'd advise the second to be fair in this case i do n't think he 's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance but rather by the knowledge that every male if given the chance would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action c'mon all you 5 star givers admit it ! you find the movie pretentious and silly but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy ! to reiterate if i wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence i 'll rewatch dallas if i wanted to see a nice rack i 'll take my top off and look in the mirror who needs mulholland drive
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant it was n't a bad '' movie it simply was n't a good '' one boooooooring
north country has a few things going for it and plenty against it the magnificent photography and gritty settings give a rare view to the forboding iron range in northern minnesota and the script and performaces by talent have the best of intentions unfortunately the sum of this film is less than its parts the storyline is simply too familiar and cliched even the town and factory settings smack of silkwood '' the backstories of spousal abuse family dysfunction and gasp lou gehrig 's disease are right out of a lifetime '' are the dramatized '' scenes of a labor meeting and the tepid courtroom confrontations the perfomances are mixed while harrelson walks thru his role with one eye on his paycheck theron uglied up '' yet again has her eye on oscar she scored an undeserved nomination for this role as she fails to convince on all fronts the best performances come from supporting players mcdormand is excellent as the ironically named glory who is beaten down the the union and by life spacek is equally effective as theron 's mother she played a similar role in marie '' in 1985 overall worth watching for the scenery and supporting cast
if north country '' did n't say that it was set in 1989 you 'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters which can only be classified as neanderthal '' though that might be an insult to neanderthals and indeed you would be right not to believe it for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975 a full decade and a half before the time of the movie the drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the clarence thomas senate hearings of 1991 images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie it 's a maneuver that does n't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie with charlize theron once again herself up for great drama north country '' tells the true but highly fictionalized story of lois jensen here referred to as josie aimes a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern minnesota steel mine only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make henry higgins look like alan alda in comparison when she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant the unenlightened townsfolk or even her own female who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs eventually she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine in 1988 actually a full three years before the clarence hill spectacle resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country there is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one but north country '' feels strangely and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world yes i realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be but that still make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie moreover north country '' ca n't quite shake that air of stultifying that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues as a result the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero villain and victim molds with very little shading in between despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story the film is riddled with push button moments and implausible instant conversions and damned if the whole thing does n't have the look and feel of a lifetime original movie just with higher priced stars in its cast frances mcdormand woody harrelson sissy spacek and richard jenkins the dead father from six feet under '' and while the acting is decent the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters perhaps it 's just that after movies like norma rae '' silkwood '' and erin brockovich '' which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised north country '' comes up a day late and a dollar short in the department
unless you enjoy lots of meaningless violence this movie is a total bore three guys and a pregnant courtney love rob a bank and escape to a western town there is a lot of shooting and a lot of people die and that is pretty much the depth of the plotline a few funny lines in there but definately not enough to be considered a comedy you know it 's a bad movie when an hour 's gone by and you 're still waiting for the point do n't waste your money on this one
straight to hell '' is a complete waste of money the only reason i continued to watch was to see how dennis hopper and grace jones could possibly elevate the film but even their brief and unsatisfying appearances could not resuscitate this dead
this film is forgotten amongst 1950 's movies for good reason it fails to deliver any type of philosophical moral to the story as the few best of the 1950 's films did and the monster scenes are way too brief as most 1950 's monster movies at least got that much right ! this island earth is a loser in my opinion it starts out very promising and good but by the middle of the film all you have seen in the way of monsters '' are people with large foreheads they finally get to the monster part of the movie in the last 10 minutes but it is way too little too late to be worthwhile there is also no redeeming moral to the story ala ' the day the earth stood still the brief monster sighting at the end could have been much better they have a great looking monster costume which looks to have been a major influence on the very famous mars attacks ! trading cards classic series but this island earth does very little with the only monster in the film one interesting role is played by the future professor on gilligan 's island which is probably the most memorable movie trivia item of this film this dvd was a waste of time and money in my opinion stay away
no truth to any of it sickeningly manipulative pure trite hollywood garbage i never write negative reviews but shame on these people the only laugh i got was at the film 's expense during the horrendous now notorious butterfly scene a complete insult to the intelligence of the american filmgoer or any other nation for that matter
sorry i 'm more of an action viewer it broke my heart to hear the gettysburg address and not see any of the battle the series teases you by placing the setting in gettysburg yet no emphasis was place on one of the most historic battles in american history stick to ted turner 's gettysburg '' if you like action
i 'm not a professional critic or one that watches many movies i just love 80 's movies and since this movie had good reviews i had to watch it i was so dissapointed with the nerd and the rebel 's bad acting in the movie it was just horrible ! i like the storyline and the soundtrack but the acting really ruined everything if you just want to watch it to see some skin and not for good quality acting then this is your movie
i love this show it is very entertaining informative and got ta be there '' i have seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again
unfortunately i have not seen the movie i ordered the wrong version i wanted the one with nicolas cage
brangelina '' shooting big guns at each other did n't do it for me no matter how beautiful they the stars or the guns are my wife said it reminded her of the war of the roses '' with michael douglas and kathleen turner which i enjoyed other than the very basic premise of hubby and wife trying to kill each other i could n't see much in common between that clever and entertaining film and this very predictable star and firepower vehicle maybe it was intended as a date movie for dual markets big guns for the guys and tabloid stars for the girls it 's appeal escaped me
i was trying to watch this film to the end but i almost could not do it the biggest problem with this film that there is no original story line absolutely 0 '' chemistry between brad and angelina acting talent also equals to zero cheap all the way through waste your time a pitty brangelina got paid for making this film i should have got paid for watching it fall for old hollywood tricks make up your own mind and rent another movie
ah true love dinner by candlelight holding hands in the moonlight snapping a new clip on your glock while your significant other sprays you with love missiles i appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon yet smith annoys more than it entertains true there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut a couple who unbeknownst to one another are professional assassins just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train add to that the erotic chemistry between brad and angelina my eyebrows are still singed after watching them but all the sexiness and lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of pitt 's detached smirk and jolie 's constant flirtation with wackiness as the fighting boy is there fighting escalates i was suddenly asking myself would n't it be great if they popped each other off '' maybe in the sequel while we 're at it would someone please feed angelina a steak mashed potatos nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim but come on lose the east africa look in the long run smith 's biggest problem was the fact vince vaughn did n't appear enough at least he gets paid to be annoying mikel
this movie is so bad that i simply could n't finish it why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi 's honor ' is beyond my wits this movie was just dumb and childish totally ridiculous and shallow
the plot is so contrived and the acting is just so bad my copy is in a landfill somewhere right on top of al pacino 's career
contrary to the format '' information in the product details '' section this dvd and justice for all '' does not include a letterbox or widescreen presentation only the pan scan presentation is included i know this because i purchased the item based on this information only to find this out upon inspection and playing of the dvd
this is the most horrible documentary i 've ever watched the narrator 's tone is dreadful sounds as if the dvd were made for children and the are torturous there are some high points snips of interviews from johnny and others but there is very little performance beyond what i assume would be fair use '' further this dvd really does n't add anything nor does it shed any new light on johnny cash the a e biography dvd is far more enriching edit i feel i really need to protect people from this product first many of the interviews are found on other products second the packaging is painfully misleading it suggests it has concert footage of the nixon concert i could n't find it apart from a few seconds of footage third it 's just plain boring i 've read the biographies i 'm not looking for a documentary but i 'm also not looking for a documentary if you 're just going to repeat what others have said what 's the point if i could give it zero stars i would
i guess i should have read the reviews first and rented this from netflix of getting excited over the dvds and buying it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no one wants to hear anyone talk during the songs ! ! ! ! ! and everyone wants to see the entire song not sound clips not a good way to sell to fans ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! extremely dissappointing
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of
i never saw this movie until i was 16. the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now
i 've been a fan of bruce campbell for a long time ever since seeing army of darkness and brisco county actually in the early nineties bruce campbell burst on to the scene with an original and fresh personae that was rolling on the floor hilarious at times i remember being devastated when they stopped producing brisco county and then so excited when they announced jack of all trades i did n't get to see the jack series though as it was n't carried in my area i decided to rectify that last month and order the series as a kind of an early christmas present to myself unfortunately i was sorely disappointed i am not sure whether i would have found this series funny or entertaining a dozen years ago when it was released but after watching the first two episodes i just did n't care to watch any more of them i felt that the half hour format did n't permit any real character development or permit them to write any really interesting plots to build on the wild wild west promise of the show or maybe it is just that i am older and my tastes have changed but for whatever reason the show did not grab me at all and i do n't see myself wasting any more time watching additional episodes i love watching bruce campbell but the magic of brisco county just did n't seem to be present in this series if you are a real bruce campbell fan though you might go ahead and give this a try just because it fell flat for me does n't mean it will for you i think bruce campbell is a and maybe i just hit this on a bad day long live bruce
this movie based on the thomas harris book is a remake of the movie 'manhunter ' the story leads up to the events of the popular silence of the lambs film red dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of hanibal lecter unfortunately the supply of thomas harris books was exhausted so they revisited and retitled this prequel to the silence of the lambs in thomas harris 's book and the original manhunter lecter was an intriguing support character only but now hollywood has discovered that hannibal 's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in red dragon to add or lenghten scenes with lecter and put him center stage the original manhunter was a fine film directed by michael mann it featured brian cox bourne identity as lecter and william peterson csi as special agent graham this movie is lacking in all aspects to the original and to the book while anthony hopkins 's portrayal is as good as cox 's edward norton is clearly out of his depth he is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that agent graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families performances by harvey keitel and ralph fiennes are also wasted here my or rent the original
mccully 1 adam mccully instructor lee hobbs engl 101.025 18 november 2005 red dragon when i heard that universal studios was making a prequel to silence of the lambs i 'll admit that i was a little skeptical throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which more or less is what this prequel was caddyshack ii godfather iii and bill and ted 's bogus journey all horrible follow ups to great films so naturally i was a little worried that the film red dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film any movie that follows a great film like silence of the lambs has a lot to live up to personally i thought that the first sequel to silence of the lambs hannibal did n't quite achieve that and neither did red dragon it was a decent movie but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first do n't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value but since it did n't come first i had already come to expect that i thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films but clearly their work shows otherwise all in all this movie disappointed me for several reasons as i mentioned before the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that i as a fan of the films had come to expect but mostly it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors i 've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception
opening statements harry potter and the sorcerors stone takes after the book by rowling the book was excelent the movie was not plot this movie as do the books take after the life of harry potter a wizard that lives with his aunt and uncle along with with his cousin dudley ok they got that part right but they keep on keepinbg out key sceans like the part when snape refs harry 's quiditch game and the parts that they did keep in were pretty poorly done many parts had a lot of attemps at comedy but they did not succed also the animation was terrible play station 1 graphics were better then that ! but they did keep on the plot pretty good plot score cast let me start out by saying that the actors that are showing their true colors now were terrible back then danaile radcliff plays harry poorly at that he is awsome today but terrible in the first one same with emma watson and rupurt grint awsome now terrible back then richard harris did an awsome job as usual in his role as dumbledore also allen rickman as snape did awsome not sure if it was the writing or just their acting skills but the acting did poorly except richard harris and allen rickman casting music john williams was very famous for his music in such films as star wars saving private ryan and war of the worlds came back to do harry potter and boy did he deliver the music in this movie was very well done the theme was very good and also he made the music as it went along with the movie so closing statements harry potter and the sorcerors stone a poor movie off of a perfect book is that what rowling gets for all her hard work in making the books i was really board in this movie and i had thought that reading words from pages was a lot funner then looking at images on a screan though some actors were good and the music was excelent you cant just live off of those two things final score is needed a new accoun
did nicholson read the script before signing for this movie was he broke that he had to act has he reached senility to accept to play in such a poor scenario well as a fan i am totally disappointed do n't waste your money for this it is not worth
i turned it off after 20 minutes
i love the walk away the pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite it 's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me
the fog '' is a fairly typical representative of a john carpenter movie it certainly has its moments yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of what might have been '' in this sense it reminds me a bit of michael mann 's 1985 version of paul wilson 's the keep '' another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good stripped to the bone the fog '' is the story of a small new england fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial or bicentennial anniversary of some type on the eve of this occasion the local priest a drunken sot played by hal holbrook discovers that the town like all horror movie small towns has a terrible secret linked to its founding this discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake and is moving towards the town various characters in the town including a local tom atkins a nubile jamie lee curtis a radio deejay adrienne barbeau and so on are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it and how it is related to the terrible secret '' an old sin for which the townsfolk mist pay as you can see while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool and when i popped the fog '' into my ancient dvd player recently i did so after a hiatus of many years with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong in this i was disappointed like the keep '' the fog '' never gets any better unlike the keep '' it actually gets worse on paper this should not have happened besides carpenter who was coming off efforts like assault on precinct 13 '' and halloween '' there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original halloween '' crew besides carptenter and jamie lee curtis there is also the girl who played annie michael 's first onscreen victim as well as the guy who played the sheriff in both h and replacing the ubiquitous donald pleasance is hal halbrook and the venerable john houseman makes an appearance in the film 's opening as a creepy storytellin ' sea captain even janet leigh is involved as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a fog victim ironically tis is part of the film 's problem and it has many first off there are far too many characters the film is cluttered with them and for some reason carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end we needed more killings not less second the performances this movie has good actors but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid the worst of it is ladeled onto adrienne barbeau who gets to repeat idiocies like my son is trapped ! trapped by the fog ! '' and look out into the darkness beware of the fog ! '' gag third the villain s carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film but he never delivers on it there is no real payoff this is because he could n't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was in the fog was the actual baddie '' of the film the result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges the fog '' might as well be a run o ' the mill flood faceless and impersonal the movie does have its moments the creepy opening the moments of atmospheric horror at sea and the excellent cinematography which is used to particular effect on the creepy but in the end these fail to outweigh the movie 's many flaws as of today i still regard carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there on the one hand he gave us halloween escape from new york and the thing all classics cult or otherwise on the other hand he also gave us crap like prince of darkness and the unwatchable ghosts of mars in between there are the fun but flawed outings like they live and in the mouth of madness i would like to say that the fog falls in this last category but i really ca n't it just is n't very good and that 's the sad fact of it bottom line beware the fog
unlike most people here i very much enjoyed season 3. it had a compelling story line and numerous villains who were played superbly i do n't understand all the season 3 hate but apparently it 's mostly to do with people being angry that syd and vaughan were n't together and having to pay attention across multiple weeks season 3 ended with syd finding a top secret file about her dated 1976. jack walks in to find a sobbing syd telling her that she was never meant to find that file reasonable people would assume that the file contains something momentous about syd 's life instead season 4 tells us that a top secret file about sydnew bristow dated 1976 was instead about the very recent killing of irina derevko huh someone needs to teach the cia how to properly title and date files that is the first of numerous disappointments in season 4 and i suppose it 's good that they get such a stinker out of the way early so that you do n't get any more hopes up the credibility of the series is ruined when the writers place arvin sloane in charge of a cia unit i mean seriously when is the cia just going to shoot this guy in the face and get it over with is this the of time the government places sloane in some great position of power after it 's revealed that he 's a terrorist of the highest order i do n't know i 've lost track worse than the sheer stupidity of the government placing sloane in charge is the reaction of all the key characters of the show remember how sloane blew up dixon 's wife well dixon is all smiles as he willingly subjugates himself to his new boss sloane it 's the same with all the characters and in one fell swoop it destroys the entire credibility of the series
without a doubt the season had some pivotal moments but too few and far between and without a clear story arc for sydney the return of lena olin gave it a shot in the arm but too little too late dull villains and dispensing with the cliffhangers were major mistakes that effectively rendered the show toothless a relentless snorefest considering the brilliance of previous seasons
this season crearly shows that abrams is commited to something else lost that zombie thing in the final chapters must be a bad joke the killer robot helicopter chapter was nonsense i 'm very disappointed with the whole season
if they 're releasing 2 volumes per season does n't that mean that there will be 18 sets since the show was on 9 years at 35 a volume that 's over 600.00 !
that sounds cruel but it 's true even without memories of audrey hepburn harrison ford is not as weirdly sinister as the miscast humphrey bogart was and greg kinnear and nancy marchand are delightful but pollack 's direction takes its cue from a twinkly score that sounds at times like satie more often like sophistication '' being spooned by rogers as bogie would say skip it
'' free radicals '' is a stark meditation on the randomness of life matching style to theme this austrian film relates a half dozen or so barely connected stories all of which deal with the part fate and luck play in determining the direction of our lives in some cases the characters are the victims of accidents or illness while in others they becomes prisoners of their own needs and desires in all the cases however the characters live a drab loveless existence filled with unfulfilled dreams and loneliness although the film begins with an interesting premise the overall effect is so and depressing that we really ca n't enjoy the movie on anything but the most purely intellectual level the people here just seem so miserable and unhappy that we want to get away from them as quickly as possible and head back to our own lives imperfect though they might be perhaps by including so many characters the film dilutes its focus making it hard for us to fully identify with any one person and make us care about his or her fate despite good acting this crazy quilt approach turns the movie into more of a clinical exercise than a deeper involving human drama and lends it an air of greater pretentiousness than it might otherwise have had enter the world of free radicals '' if you must but you might want to take some prozac along with you to help get you through it
i really did n't enjoy the movie but i had to finish it the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the fundamentalist that i know but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word no one actually reads a bible in the movie consequently most made many decisions i hated the reality '' of the movie but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is
bought this dvd for only 10 dollars at a shopping centre only because they did n't have this movie to rent at the video shop after so much publicity trailers ads on busses you 'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around however i nearly fell asleep in it had to turn away more than a few times in boredom and cliched to infinity just watch the ending pathetic and predictable if you like predictable movies this dvd will be your new best friend if not try something with a bit more imagination
before i saw this movie i was warned that is was and that the writers of the screenplay did n't have a clue as to what following christ is really all about after seeing the movie i am convinced of the latter but only somewhat of the former mandy moore does a great job playing a legalistic '' type named hilary who goes beyond witnessing '' in her attempts at converting others by using crisis intervention tactics like blocking the hallways with her and her friends or attempting to kidnap the subject and throwing into their van for treatment for hilary christianity is all about behavior modification she lacks heart winds up with bitterness her only hope at the end comes from her wheelchair bound brother a nonbeliever who offers to help her with her problems one can only assume that rather than correcting her misperceptions of jesus he will instead try to deprogram her of her faith hilary 's nemesis who she constantly tries to convert is cassandra played by eva amurri cassandra a jewish girl determined not to convert brings to mind matthew she has heard the word and understandeth it not '' as a person who received the seed '' by the wayside she becomes a hero in the end for having a big heart though she still chooses the earthly path rather than the spiritual one thinking she only needs to rely on herself mary played wonderfully by jena malone for her innocence seems to turn against god a bit too easily when in trouble see matthew blaming god when it was she who forgot to bring protection along seems very shortsighted for a girl with such strong willed faith but many young christians do feel persecuted when they do n't get what they pray for a sign of spiritual immaturity the problem with this movie is that no one has spiritual maturity including the writers of the screenplay even the most sinful pastor will answer yes '' when asked by a young gay teenager banned from prom night if jesus still loves him this one does n't know what to say there are no answers given to the audience of this film most of whom are young people looking for answers so i will give a short one here saint augustine said something that at first sounds irresponsible when not fully understood he said love god and then do as you please '' what he meant is that when we really love jesus intensely for who he is and what he sacrificed for us our hearts will change sinful behavior we used to commit no longer has the same appeal to us as before being obedient to god brings us pleasure when we have true love and devotion to christ we are still sinners but no longer by desire not perfect but forgiven would it have been so difficult to include just one character at a christian school who mentions this the difficulty lies in finding screenwriters in hollywood who have a clue about it do n't get me wrong all of the characters in this movie were essential ! but they forgot the most essential of all
i 'm sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target to imply that christians are typically mean and is pure racism this is just as evil as implying that all jews are rich or that all have rhythem what has jesus himself done to warrant such out of hollywood the man has suffered enough on the cross leave him alone
the first thing you should know about the hurricane is that it was based on two books one of which the sixteenth round was written by rubin carter the second thing you should know is that rubin carter is not a man of exemplary honesty the third thing you should know is that the other book lazarus and the hurricane on which this movie was based was written by two of the canadians who bought into carter 's hokum as have so many after them i will not go into a list of the patently false claims that carter makes in his book since other posters here have already done a good job of that instead i 'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews these are divided into three groups the first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride if you belong in this group i do not fault you hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public but let me ask you this if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title hero '' would you still rate it highly if your answer is yes '' then you belong in the second group those who gave this movie a on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies to this group i have this to say if a filmmaker wants to present a story he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right it 's called integrity and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability you say this is a dramatization and not a documentary well even a dramatization should be done with some integrity i can go along with some minor embellishments here and there but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story that in my book is unforgivable and so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie 's dishonesty vested interest does not render their arguments invalid finally to the third group those who actually believe that carter is in fact a i ask you to please open your eyes there is absolutely no documentation to support carter 's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile that he was a civil rights activist that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image on the other hand there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man 's delusional fantasies you say that cal deal the man behind is a racist please visit also know this deal went into the rubin carter case actually believing that carter was innocent it took just one interview for deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in carter 's statements he went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed carter as a liar many accounts today have it that carter is a changed man i sincerely hope this is a real change and not just a show but whatever the case the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash i 'm not counting on that though
for what purpose these lies about the life of this man are the liberal film makers racists who do n't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man facts in the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times ! in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved fact giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape the depitction is another lie another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder fact is that carter 's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights as carter 's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america shame norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood did n't care they just like the message looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet america bashing and race baiting is alive and well earning oscars and making for big box office a shame
i bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored in other words i had no desire to continue reading it much of what he says are n't his ideas he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers so it 's probably better just to buy their books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others he apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he 's done before or from others to get rich dyer definitely has an intention and it 's to get rich by selling his mediocre books
i have been as a red sox fan as they come the past of my life i love the sox the ups and downs of rooting for them and new england i hate this dvd for 90 minutes the viewer must endure watching a number of barely distinguishable red sox fans follow the team during the 2003 season most of these people annoyed the hell out of me it 's unbearable i do n't want to watch a bunch of whiny overly jerks on my tv i also thought there would be some of players there was nothing worth mentioning really every once in a while there 's an annoying shot of kevin millar acting like a 'tard or talking about something that makes no sence in fact there are more scenes in this film that have no point of reference or capture dialogue in the middle of a sentence that i never knew what the hell anyone was talking about it 's like a bad film school project it blows i sat down all excited to watch this thing after they won the this year and i all i got was one big
i am a big baseball fan so i forced myself to sit through the whole thing this movie was very slow and it completely lost my attention the combination of a strong cast and great original material taken from the play should have equaled a fun movie i normally like movies like this where the action takes place in one setting this being a minor league ballpark unfortunately i paid the price of my enthusiasm this movie plodded along at a snail like pace was n't funny and the plot was too unbelievable the protagonists in the movie fight bicker with their wives and even fall in love all within 2 hours of a baseball game i recommend the play instead
the special effects are quite good the plot pacing acting internal consistency and internal logic much less so even fantasy must have some internal logic to maintain willing suspension of disbelief it needs some tension some drama and some surprises dinotopia lacks much of this most of the plot twists are foreshadowed well in advance the major suprises mostly come from hopelessly illogical acts by the major characters an example someone tries to kill a character in waterfall city the victim survives and is rescued not only does it never seem that any charges are brought against the villain he reappears later and is accepted warrily by our heros the plotting is obvious when it is hoplessly muddled there is foreshadowing about a major secret of the dinosaurs a missing commandment on the obilisk of rules '' when revealed the secret is an the motives of the carivore villains are unexplored are they as intelligent as the herbavores why are they guarding the entrances to the underground ruins tradition even the suprise '' appearance of one character is too well foreshadowed to be a surprise more of a huh '' thought so no explanation is given for the one bit of driving tension why the mysterious sunstones are wearing out and why anyone would expect those underground not to be failing at the same rate no explanation is even remotely tendered for how a 200 mile wide island of such diverse terrain could possibly be hidden in the atlantic given the wreckage and the islanders ' knowledge of a war with germany the atlantic makes more sense than the pacific even a nod towards time travel dimentional portals etc would have been handy all in all the pretty pictures are n't worth 4 hours of your time
not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes it 's tantamount to watching old batman episodes as soon as something develops in comes the cheesy music the added scenes were poorly produced which is why they did n't make the original cut the interviews seemed contrived i 'm not impressed the older version supersedes the new
ugh ! i made it through forty minutes when having reached my limit of 1500 cliches per film i gave up what a shallow piece of tripe ! i should have known at the very beginning when a woman who had apparently lost a family member to a traffic accident said mournfully that she could no longer get close to anyone '' for fear they would be taken away '' it goes downhill from there folks if such a thing can be imagined
i bought this based on the excellent reviews and was very disappointed we played it at a gathering and no one wanted to continue the dvd after the first minute
after waiting so long to see some of these great films in widescreen dvd it is a major disappointment to see the quality of the transfers in this collection as another reviewer has noted naked spur is not good and cheyenne social club looks like the entire film was transferred out of focus low bit rate to make two features fit on the two sided dvd who knows hard to believe the source material is marred in this way i bought the collection cheyenne and firecreek are available on their own as a set that may or may not be better i 've seen warner features 30 years older that look much better shame on you time warner
when you receive this set they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf for an additional 2.98 what arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder century fox entertainment should be boycotted they make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents all in addition to the original cost of the discs i love the simpsons but i am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is cool this time he 's trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film it 's like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the lakers and the staples center get a plug it 's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it as usual uma 's acting is simply dreadful i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad how she became a star '' in hollywood is beyond me she is not attractive nor can she act she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles they call her john travolta is not much better his version of cool '' just does n't do it for me his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes they were so funny i had to see them again cedric the entertainer was also pretty good
the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said hey do n't forget the book ! '' but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit be cool '' provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there 's too little to sustain a feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a the rock does the best he can but again 's a gay bodyguard ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he 's an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman 's performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there 's just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch shorty'again or read cool '
all style '' and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer '' please go away i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over
my son loves real life '' trucks and big machines so i thought these would be fun for him to watch they are not in fact they do n't even hold his attention dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on dave i have since bought the i love cat machines series and they are fantastic
i am a teacher that has taught for twelve years both in preschool and grade school i bought this dvd for my son who is 17 months he was born premature and is considered speech delayed and i was thinking that this dvd might help i was very disappointed this dvd is nothing other than moving flash cards the screen shows several items and repeats the item 's names over and over i understand the concept but it failed to keep my son 's attention even when i sat and watched it with him trying to redirect him toward the the second and third time viewing he would n't watch it at all this dvd is going up for sale on ! save your money and just use real objects in your house in which your child shows interest point to those objects play with them and name them this will be a much more meaningful experience for your child if you are looking for entertaining dvds that hold a young child 's attention try the baby einstein series or the sesame street dvds
my 20 month old son is speech delayed and i bought this dvd based on all the positive reviews i 've seen maybe i 'm missing something but i thought it was horrible first of all it barely held my son 's attention but the worst part was that i absolutely can not stand the music ! i could barely make it through watching it even the first time same thing with volume 2. we bought the baby babble dvd about 6 weeks ago and i think it is much better than these bumblebee dvd 's my son can watch baby babble over and over and over again
this movie was obviously made by japanese fans of several american films it then tried to mix them all together in one film the main ones are the matrix reservoir dogs and night of the living dead especially the matrix we have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life then it is a genre gore film heavy with feuding yakuza elements our main character has the long black matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor the 360 camera movements of the matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the aspect instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action i really hated the matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the matrix already has a big strike against it as for the other elements they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite american movies that they wanted to include the gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting note that if you are looking for something different than typical american movies by checking out those wacky japanese movies you will not get it here
just kidding actually massachusetts has nothing to worry about the people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as martians would an effect fellini was deliberately going for the only reason i rented this disc is because john lennon once said that the beatles ' life on tour was like fellini 's satyricon i can only hope that the fab four 's nights in australia the philippines and japan were more fun than this movie more a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative satyricon just how does one pronounce it anyway bets eveything on its visuals some work and are impressive but after a half hour even diehard film buffs will tire of watching fellini try to top himself every five minutes i hated fellini 's la dolce vita but being a good sport i decided to give the famed italian director one more shot by watching this i do n't think i want to go for strike three anytime soon one could pretty much watch the scenes in any order as an added annoyance it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming just like they did in the spaghetti westerns since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists one only has imagery to go on so let me describe the movie in montage form we see large slabs of meat bonfires fat pedophiles fat homosexuals thin homosexuals a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice an annoying poet with a beautiful voice there are midgets galley slaves oily wrestling matches a sweaty minotaur heads chopped off mutilations suicides a man swinging from a noose lots of froliking little real sex and no eroticism an earthquake sabers centaurians dusty vistas squeaky wagons a painted woman painted men loin cloths art work and as cosmo kramer once said lots of unbridled enthusiasm what does it all add up to two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted if you want great imagery in a foreign film stick with werner herzog 's work
saw hart 's war '' the other night and could n't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days here are ten reasons why 1. this film is n't the great escape '' and even though he would probably like to think otherwise bruce willis is n't steve mcqueen even though willis received top billing this is a colin farrell vehicle 2. the vast majority of the target audience of year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration much less world war ii hart 's war '' may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812. anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets 3. as far as depicting life in a pow camp hart 's war '' is pretty much on par with hogan 's heroes '' the germans are nice guys with guns who do n't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything where did the gi 's get all those cigarettes anyway 4. any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him as depicted in hart 's war '' the camp commandant as portrayed by marcel lures would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army his collection of american records is a cute writer 's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps in reality the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic 5. the storyline is not completely unbelievable trials did take place in pow camps one good example being the pow 's who were tried and hung in andersonville however the whole idea that the camp 's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous 6. the idea that during the trial a group of pow 's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions the german army simply was n't that stupid 7. i saw this film once and did n't like it i thought that maybe the second time would be better it was n't 8. beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness hart 's war '' seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which for most pow 's was just day to day survival also the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n't spineless hapless dopes 9. bruce willis playing the same role in variations of die hard '' over and over and over again is tiring 10. better films about the same sort of subject matter are the tuskeegee airmen '' and stalag 17 '' hopefully in a few years hart 's war '' will be completely forgotten and these dvd 's will be rotting in some landfill
hart 's war had potential the last months of world war two as a backdrop with demoralized gi 's crammed into an overcrowded pow compound if this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the battle of the bulge then it could have had a chance instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots unintentionally the movie borrows from slaughterhouse five a soldier 's story the great escape and stalag 17. a cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple in hart 's war we find some good elements lost in a virtual mulligan stew in the story colin farrell 's character a rear echelon lawyer accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride unfortunately for farrell the germans have launched their attack in the ardennes the young lawyer is captured harshly interrogated and finally shipped out to a german stalag there he meets the senior pow officer played by bruce willis and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a pow a soldier is killed and a recently downed tuskegee airman is accused of murder yes you guessed it farrell takes on the aviator 's defense during the subsequent courts martial if director gregory hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged instead we have additions of colonel hart 's unexplained behavior an mass tunnel escape plot sabotage and the german commandant 's attempt to befriend the american lawyer as superfluous baggage hart 's war was filmed in the czech republic no doubt to cut costs a little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office still if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this dvd to your collection
unfortunately you shipped me a region 1 version when i am clearly in uk you then shipped a foc replacement again you then offered me a refund if i paid to ship them back to you as i have not been able to view either copy and can not give you a better review ''
i had several friends insist that i rent this film i 'm glad i did instead of buying it i was not bowled over as they obviously were quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film now i 'm not a hard guy to make laugh but there was only one point in this film where i actually laughed out loud other than that i found sordid lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced i love southern humor and even poking fun at southerners i ca n't tell you how much i love greater tuna fried green tomatos steel magnolias etc but this just did n't cut it for me the cast is a who 's who of excellent character actors beau bridges bonnie bedelia leslie jordan olivia for pete 's sake ! erik krieger delta burke and gobs of others no it 's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks i found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once there 's a scene with ty an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in west hollywood talking to his in the reception area of their therapist well as a theatre director i can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them there are various filming techniques that del shores the director uses that are just hackneyed filming from behind a person 's back so that only the back of one person 's head and the facing person are seen why it feels like a testimonial video '' from mtv 's real world rather than an actual film frankly and this is not always a bad thing the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film it can be a great thing ! look at altmans ' come back to the five and dime jimmy dean and you 'll see how a good stage to film movie is done but this well it 's just amateur hour from my perspective in all the film felt like a poor man 's greater tuna two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in texas ' smallest town which was a stage play and was filmed for hbo as a stage play rather than attempting to make it feel like a film i wanted to like this film but i just didn't
i am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf i had to return it
as a fan of kathy 's first video total fitness workout i was really looking forward to this one i hate to say this but it really stinks working out has to be fun concise get the job done etc etc this is n't fun and it 's way too long and just plain boring i turned it off after the first 15 minutes do n't bother buying this one it 's terrible ! ! it 's not an exercise routine that you would enjoy doing over and over what happened
i do n't usually bother reviewing things but i had to say something about this first off the positives it is hard and demanding my muscles were sore the next day that 's it the negatives well let 's start with the completely amateurish presentation she may be fit but she comes across as if she does n't have a clue what she 's talking about she does n't do mirror cueing which i think is a basic requirement in the cardio intervals she has to take breathers so just as you 're ready to go onto the next move you have to stop to let her catch up with you some of the moves in the cardio intervals i think are not good for lower backs lots of bending down touching the floor and back up again sort of thing the stretch section at the end is useless you do n't stretch your upper body at all and all the weights sections are for upper body and then they finish off with a water fight while some manic bloke shouts 'you did it ' over and over again at her if you can ignore her and switch off before he jumps out you will get a good workout but there are plenty of challenging dvds out there which are much more professional
i 'm a great fan of the avengers but after seeing the ultimate avengers i was hurt i thought it was much too graphic for children furthermore the story resembles the pilot series of the justice league '' i expected better from marvel i guest it 's just the signs of the times i mean kids are so accustomed to seeing blood and gore in their video games why not their cartoon series right no wonder some have no qualms about pulling guns on peers and shooting them in the head i can not in good conscience recommend this dvd to children i would be doing a disservice to society
i am a cartoon and a comic fan i have been for years i think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do the first ultimate avengers was at times but i thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch but the second ultimate avengers i thought this one took it a little too far there is a lot of hacking and slashing a lot of really brutal fight scenes and not alot of the avengers usually hero violence is punching the badguy out or throwing him through a wall but in this film they are trying to kill and that is hard to watch with a child in the room i watched it once with my daughter and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film for me i kinda liked it but i wo n't watch it very often for my daughter i would n't want her to watch it again
after watching the 1 ultimate avengers i was expecting a another action packed romp through the park but i realized this was truly the hulk make the movie extremely appealing with his rampage while decimating everything i expected to see even more of the hulk this time and pretty much got nothing yuk for the sidekicks no offense all the other hero 's are just sidekicks to the hulk blah blah while the black panther was cooler than i thought he would be this was boring where was the hulk marvel can you please do an american icon like the hulk some love and give him some air time hulk must smash and i cheered when he did finally show up but sorry this movie was mostly lame well i bought it and i am stuck with it i am feinding for the hulk to take it somebody villan or hero and open up a can o zzz please marvel enough with the aliens there are some really cook villians in the marvel universe really cool and i have been a fan of the avengers for decades but as much as i like indepence day the movie this avengers seemed more like a knock off do yourself a favor wait until it comes on cartoon network or something this was truly mediocre hulk smash ! ! ! !
i never saw this movie until i was 16. the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even '' absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !
i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since
i rented this movie from netflix recently expecting a wonderfully campy cheesy horror film wrong its just an hour and a half of boring film the plot is lacking the characters are annoying especially duane its simply a ridiculous film
after having seen this movie i understand why europeans arabs and everybody else hates americans there are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear the story idea is great but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he really fallen in love with the building everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself it 's a miracle to us how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining the movie is bad pretending it to be a satyre does n't make it any better
i can not believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we 've seen in films like baby boy '' almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word he did n't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance i do n't know what this film was about there are parts where there is a long silence with no talking the whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house there are a few scenes where the characters are running around without any obvious aim the film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying what was all that excitement about ''
how anyone could rate this movie stars is beyond belief this was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere as i watched this movie i could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama it was never very funny and both lead actors playing one white and one adopted black brother had scenes in the movie that were terrible romany malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body he jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them in his drawers he is talentless and idiotic as a brother '' in france that no one can relate to paul rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and grossly '' tells off everyone people he has known for less than a week ! the servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well but ca n't make up for the dismal rest ludicrous a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama this is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints
umm the title says pretty much how i feel about this movie soo much potential but it chokes they are a few nice scenes but not enough to watch it again and who really wants to see terry bradshaw 's body come on that was sick
failure to launch was quite of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast matthew mcconaughey sarah jessica parker and kathy bates among others a 35 man 's parents plot to have their son move out of the house ! by hiring a professional who feigns interest in him in short the acting is generally pretty good though nothing great the setting is above average while the dialogues and the plot are below average the major setbacks are in relation to 1 the weak plot and especially the weak dialogues for which the writers are to blame matthew mcconaughey sarah jessica parker and kathy bates were given weak lines what a waste of a good cast ! 2 the whole nephew '' issue was just ridiculous ! 3 the whole naked father thing 4 parents plotting to get rid of their child is absurd on a positive note zooey deschanel is delightful as kit let 's see more of her though the potential for a decent movie was definitely there it fails to take off primarily due to the writers in a nutshell it 's a mediocre movie and that 's about it wait till they show it on tv
with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance yet does n't stray too far from what he knows best there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers patton oswalt appears in a blink and you 'll miss him scene but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who 's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play bates is great as mcconaughey 's mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker 's flatmate parker should stick to television she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie a good date movie flick the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained special features are nothing too special a trailer and a few dodgy featurette 's a rainy night rental movie
i saw this movie while flipping through tv stations late one night actually it was early in the morning it said king arthur in the title so me being a fan of arthurian legend and having apparently missed this movie from i had some problems with it so the kid '' in question is playing baseball apparently he is not very good at it ie strikes out a lot after he strikes out to his a big gigantic earthquake came and sucked him into a big whole which apparently is some sort of or something they do n't really explain that well it 's a kids movie so i will give them that one for free anyways he gets spat out in the medieaval ages in camelot '' a few items about king arthur and his family arthur never reached old age in this movie he appeared as a grandfather figure and he also did n't have two daughters he had one son mordred as in this movie well most of the movie is spent with the people from that era usually the nobility and knights and arthur 's one daughter who is the kid 's age oggling at his backpack which he lukily brought with him of futuristic wonders '' and they have a jolly good time but he wants to get back home where 's merlin oh he 's a willy old face in a well yep so he gets about a days worth of knight training from a generous knight and suddenly he 's a master fighter and jouster as seen later in the film anyways the movie ends with him getting back and his new love arthur 's daughter and arthur being in the real world with him yeah like arthur would leave his kingdom for some kid and he 's sent back before the infamous strike out blah blah blah all in all kids may be impressed and like this movie i did n't find it too entertaining if you want a movie about a future guy '' in the past a conneticut yankee in king arthur 's court was way better this did n't do it for me and may not for a lot of other people
this dvd was both a waste of time only 49 minutes long and money if you enjoy pissing away your cash and wasting time waiting for something to be funny this is your dvd however if you like to laugh and work hard for your money and spend it wisely steer clear of this sorry gilbert i usually enjoy your humor but there was none of that here i actually feel sorry for the people who were at the taping of this disc having to sit though this wreck
absolutely filthy the title indicates jokes but there is nothing in here that resembles a joke it is a continual litany of filthy statements i am sorry i purchased this and only give it a 1 star because that is the lowest choice i would give it a 0 or lower
ok so lets make and extremely crappy zombie movie with grandpa's old movie camera and put a really cool picture on the dvd cover so it looks intriguing ! good lord folks this is bad ! quite rarely do i take a gamble and buy a movie that i have not heard about beforehand im positive it will never happen again even the 3.99 price tag on this dvd is far too costly as i am sure that i could find a decent drink coaster for cheaper anyone who likes this movie is either involved in its production or in a coma
it was selling for 9.99 in circuit city but passed it up prefer to rent first
the movie dead life '' by director william victor shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as night of the living dead or at least it tries to be unfortunately it 's a stupid attempt and being original through looking old which in itself is an irony looking at its writing there 's absolutely nothing to commend this movie on though this movie at least tries to give you an explanation as to the existence of zombies it 's as as a cat 's decision to chase a shiny object the common mistake made with romero 's films is that the story was n't well thought out since they never really explain the zombies except a bit in the original about a meteor however what people do n't realize is it does n't matter why romero 's films are satirical in nature they focus on a larger picture and disregard details that 's what makes them so great that 's what makes them films dead life makes some attempt and showing depth with its underlying theme except it 's stupid and unoriginal and really not shocking or in the slightest this movie is not shocking it 's not realistic even the gore scene '' everyone is referring to is only a stupid attempt at being shocking and but it comes off as just being tasteless people are giving this movie credit for having no money but really people have done better with less the acting is ridiculous the sound is poorly dubbed the camera is always out of focus and the special effects are lame it is a tasteless zombie romp with no point whatsoever it does n't deserve credit for having a low budget it makes no effort to make people think and makes no effort to be good period night of the living dead was a film this is not even close to reaching that level oh and it actually takes sound effects straight from the first resident evil game and dubs them in seriously
okay i admit they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends heres my problem they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera most of the scenes were blurry every now and again the focus was clear i mean c'mon when i was fourteen i made a short stop motion animation film using an old bell and howell super 8 cam and even then i paid attention to the enough of that now for the pros of the film the fx were good and there is one scene that will make most men wince the outdoor and some indoor settings had a notld feel overall i recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds at least you can say you saw it rent if you can if not buy used
for years i 've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for horror movies but i 'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is dead life do n't be fooled when i say this movie is shot on film it seriously looks like it was shot on a camera it 's perpetually grainy dark fuzzy and shaky and not in an artsy way my 200 video camera looks infinitely better than this the video quality is appropriate however as it 's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this the sound is murky and undecipherable the acting is strictly amateur hour the characters are with no distinction or purpose the story is the dialogue is a completely worthless bore there 's nothing remotely scary and the special effects including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a commodore 64 are laughable or at least i wish they were laughable that would 've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this high school student film it 's movies like this cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy but which get cherry spots on blockbuster shelves because they 're packaged with slick cover art that give horror movies in general and zombie movies in particular a bad name and that make horror fans so wary disgraceful !
let me start by saying that i love indipendent features and support them fully a movie like this threatens my support the actors i use that term loosly are just dreadful and have any emotion the dreadful sex scene is only dreadful in the fact that they wasted good film to shoot it the sfx are passable and the story is just a retread do not waste your time with this i have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features it reads exactly like the review that is quoted on the case if you want to see how good indipendent features can be purchase van bebbers the manson family or the upcoming actress apocolpse
unfocused repetitive and worst of all boring ! what should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame ronnie earle the district attorney at the center of the film says this is n't about democrats and republicans this is about cops and robbers '' if only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say instead from the start the big buy feels like a film you 've walked into thirty minutes late following the theme stated by earle of cops and robbers the big buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely wo n't notice somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story to bad it 's not being told here
with the exception of disc 6 this collection was very disappointing it was obvious that the show lost its charm after season 3 and was well on its way out before paul reubens little incident however if you liked herman the first collection under playhouse 1 is excellent it was fresh and innovative my 3 year old loves the first 6 discs disc 7 to disc 10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase they should have included disc 6 with the first set anything after that was simply not entertaining the quality of all the discs still is excellent
this movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity believability and budget and can we say just squish the leeches already not worth your time
i recently bought season 3 of greatest american hero '' what 's up though with the episodes being out of order ralph and pam are married in about 3 to 4 episodes disc 1 2 before we actually see the wedding on disc 3. it was disappointing when i started watching the episodes and realized this i decided to copy the episode guide so i could view the episodes in the right order the first two seasons released were in the right order possibly anchor bay manufactured season 3 wrong
elmo 's fire '' is one of those movies that could have been better should have been better and yet it just was n't it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the the brat pack well everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall who were spared this misstep maybe this was supposed to be the breakfast club after college '' but while the breakfast club '' had characters even stereotypical characters that you could relate to there is absolutely no one with the exception of emilio estevez ' character that you care enough about to relate to in this film the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois but georgetown where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college yeah right judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage problem is nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy or maybe it 's just the pearls emilio estevez is a future attorney working as a and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell mare winningham is a dowdy type girl who is still holding on to her virginity working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her she instead fantasizes about rob lowe who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band who has dropped out of school married a white looking groupie had a child with her and has now separated from her and taking up with other groupies demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking has a serious coke problem stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol sounds promising huh well in what is an early portend of the melrose place '' to come sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is dumps his ass immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job estevez after screwing up a lucrative job by hosting a party there travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home lowe in between his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus moore after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother has all her furnishings repossessed loses her job and freaks out not exactly the breakfast club '' the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves with the exception of estevez ' character they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped their every action every line of dialogue seems like just that they seem very one dimensional their angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that winningham 's character could have been salvagable that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was and yet she still gave her virginity to him maybe if winningham was n't so bright or she was a college freshman it would be understandable but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent lowe really had little to do with his role maybe if he had played the role nelson had as the roving lothario with sheedy waiting at home it might have gone over better with his looks it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player moore basically plays herself interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems mirroring her character but was later rehired while the title song later become a minor hit elmo 's fire '' itself missed the mark
of all the hateful characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio macdowell is n't stalking hilarious and is n't kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you 've ever seen i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them all to be friends '' to which they both reply the classic cinema line ehhhh '' wow now that 's drama
this was the movie that gave us the brat pack a staple of a certain cultural set the term brat pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in elmo 's fire on a boozy night of partying since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who were n't in the movie anthony michael hall for example suffered a bit of a ripple effect here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl 's bedroom wall out of all the dramedies of the john hughes movies this was the one i liked the least maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college it was trying to be the next generation graduate '' movie and i did n't relate when my time came maybe it had to do with the fact that i have been let down by many people and did n't have that network of friends in similar situations and the isolation i felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia i guess i was just a little more bitter plus as my life was surrounded by work and little else i did n't have all the dramas going on they did that was kind of sad the one scene where rob lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team it proves you really ca n't go home again and there are some clinging to the past not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties this caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset it 's not a bad story but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold
this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem '' be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history
a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis
to borrow from a previous reviewer a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering
i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor and fanatic as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the conflict she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary 's great desire and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just does n't cut it
the '' has got to be one of the most overrated overhyped shows that i have ever seen this side of friends '' this show makes me ashamed to be from is nothing appealing or compelling about a bunch of rich spoiled suburban white teens sorry i mean year old acters playing teenagers and their so called problems '' admit i tried to give this show a chance i tried to watch a few episodes and really i could n't make it passed the half an hour mark turning it to adult swim or some nick at night '' or something and speaking of white is '' suppose to stand for orange county '' or only caucasians '' i had no idea that their were no black mexican or asian people that lived in the '' peter gallagher 's character is suppose to be the bad guy '' huh please ! how about i snatch this chump off the '' streets toss him in a trunk and take him to long beach compton crenshaw or watts and then lets see how bad '' a guy he is then the bottom line is i ca n't stand this gay fake show and i ca n't stand all you losers that praise it even more ! and by the way this show do n't even belong in the same zip code as 90210 ! now put that in yo pipes and smoke it !
i never saw this movie until i was 16. the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now
i bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so i would n't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation unfortunately the routines were confusing and difficult to follow it also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving i was very disappointed especially after reading all the other great reviews 10 minutes into the workout i turned it off because my heart rate was n't what i wanted for a cardio workout i would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner
i was hoping for an exercize routine i could really use but this is so dancy and complicated that it 's tough to follow i enjoy aerobics in general but there are so many shoulder shimmies '' and hip circles '' in this video it makes me wonder if it was created for entertainment purposes rather than to give us a workout if you need a good workout that you can realistically follow consider something else
zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on mafia and on this tour its really hard to take and i 'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on shot to hell bls are a great group but zakk 's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles blessed hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the cds stoned and drunk and funeral bell are critically altered to the point where i had to skip them i 'm actually starting to suspect that zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect because i ca n't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way a few tunes sung this way i can handle buts its total overkill on this dvd the behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because zakk is a funny guy
the acting is so bad in this horror film prettey corney mov
i expected alot more from richard harris he was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of abraham also there was n't enough vocal input from god expecially since his promises to abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant there were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible i was somewhat annoyed that the movie had god saying that sarai 's name means princess and that he would change it to sarah which means queen this is not true ! ! in hebrew sarah means princess such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability
in dr yang 's dvd i expected to find a good reference for my practice of the yang 108 form but i am very displeased with the quality of the dvd for the price that i paid i expected a least good video quality when yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor there are close ups of the upper body and obviously the movement of the legs is not seen you get lost with changes of camera angles at some point you can see people in the background and the stage is not properly set up also and with all due respect his movements are weird i have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed definitively i do not recommend this dvd to any one who wants to use it as a reference you can use it as a movie
i have had the pleasure of teaching my hearing grandchildren to sign and i was looking forward to adding this video to our signing library i was disappointed with both the format and the word selection the format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and the words are of marginal interest to them market bakery florist etc my grandchildren are more interested in signs for words such as milk eat more all done mommy daddy baby etc perhaps this video is more appropriate for older children my grandchildren have learned more than forty signs from the my baby can talk videos they are simply enchanted by these videos even my older grandchildren continue to watch these videos with their younger siblings and they all interact with the videos while they watch i would recommend this series for preverbal babies and babies who are beginning to speak
as a counselor for families with young babies i have had the opportunity to review a number of language programs both sign and verbal for preverbal babies and babies who are just beginning to verbalize as with baby wordsworth the production quality of this dvd is excellent however the words and signs presented are not appropriate for either preverbal babies who are trying to communicate basic wants and needs or toddlers who are beginning to speak instead of offering words and signs such as eat drink milk more mommy daddy baby etc this program presents bank florist bakery etc not only is the choice of words and signs questionable but the visual distinctions between scenes such as cafe restaurant and market is difficult for a baby to understand the format is also geared towards older children five words and signs are presented in rapid succession and then extended scenes for each word are shown then the same five words and signs are offered again by a child of four years or older in addition the signs themselves are difficult for young babies as most of the signs are combinations of more than one sign such as ice cream '' plus store '' there are no babies signing or speaking in this production and no tutorial for parents of hearing babies who are teaching their babies to use sign language i recommend the my baby can talk '' series to teach either sign language or first spoken words to babies
i love radiohead repeat i love radiohead they put out the best 4 albums in a row since the beatles in the 60 's that being said this is the worst produced dvd i have ever ! it features perhaps 8 cameras with random selection of camera choice at almost exactly 4 second intervals it is almost impossible to become interested in any part of the proceedings because you do n't have the opportunity to watch any one of the fellas do anything for more than 4 seconds at a time i ca n't believe anyone allowed this to happen who thought this was a good idea he or she should be forced to watch this abomination it 's like staring into a strobe lite for an hour the only saving grace is that it is filmed '' at a time when the band was beginning to ferment play it but do n't you dare watch or your likely to wind up in convulsions on the floor come on boys enough is enough give us a good modern dvd in at least dolby i would n't care if you just used one camera please pretty please by the way would everyone please drop any references to the band called sorry my fingers wo n't allow me to type the complete name how did radiohead ever get linked with this completely unoriginal and mediocre band
or i should say was both badly drawn written and performed by terrible voice actors the dvd package and the disks are also badly made still using below average aol software for the transfer to disk are n't you warners you geeks
director bill condon cast tony todd kelly rowan william o'leary bill nunn matt clark david gianopoulos fay hauser joshua gibran mayweather timothy carhart veronica cartwright running time 93 minutes rated r for violence and gore and for some sexuality and language many horror fans absolutely worship the original candyman '' because it 's so genuinely scary and intelligently adapted from a clive barker story this sequel it looks more like a prequel actually with all those flashbacks is not entirely unwatchable it just immensely pales in comparison to the original like so many other redundant sequels do it seems though director bill condon and his army of crew members totally missed the point of barker 's tale and of the original film what began as a tale of enigmatic mystery and mystique brooding with paranoia is now been cut down to another hacker series that takes away from the brilliance of the 1992 original it 's mardi gras season in new orleans where school teacher annie tarrant kelly rowan proves to her class that there is no candyman by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times she should have listened to them because of course there is a candyman and her brother ethan william o'leary knows it as he 's been arrested for the murder of the smug fat bloke from the first film but of course he 's innocent and the real culprit is the killer back to wreak more havoc in the lives of annie 's family believing that ethan and her mother veronica cartwright are n't telling her the whole truth about his arrest and her father 's death annie delves into the legend herself farewell to the flesh '' departs from the original with annie 's deep dark family secret which is not only completely predictable but also totally uninteresting the supposed twists only start coming after way too much draggy where the movie tries to create mystery about the existence of the candyman even though we all know he 's real and we all know what 's going to happen from this point on the menace of the character has gone his appearances are too numerous and are n't scary and the moments when he pops up to stick his hook through someone 's back are completely expected basically this does nothing that the original did n't do better with the poor black area of town the missing kid the cops believing ethan carried out the candyman 's crimes and the candyman 's spell over annie all being derivative of the first movie the mardi gras setting adds some colour but has nothing to do with the story and gives us the irrelevant at times nonsensical radio show that weaves through the movie the change of location also weakens the candyman mythos because an urban legend in one part of a town i can believe but now apparently everyone in the civilised world has heard of and lives in fear of the candyman the film tries too hard to turn him into a horror icon along the lines of freddy or michael myers and it succeeds only too well because this time around the impact has gone too much detail is revealed about his origin and the story is a pale imitation of what 's already been done before
ok this movie is for either black people or white woman then you may enjoy it this is soo silly and corny i want my money back interesting idea but no thanks lo
nelson is correct ! ! half of the movie or dvd viewing experience is the sound ! ! ! this dvd is in mono ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! all the positives about this series remains the best of all time but the 3 cruise versions all have way way better sound and dvd extras i fully recommend the 5 alias '' seasons over this package because of the far superior sound and obvious similarities to the original mission impossible tv series
we discovered that this dvd of mission impossible the complete first season will not provide subtitles and no closed captions 1960 's tv mission impossible was my favorite tv show of all time we are hearing impaired both deaf and hard of hearing and we want to see what they said from this legendary tv classic show we survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations prejudice and bigotry such as audism please do n't buy this dvd without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from tv screen show to video without mastering of video techniques such as coloring subtitles etc paramount home video company often made cheap and flawed dvd video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality you will be deeply disappointed when you see this dvd of mission impossible the complete first season ''
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of
this is the time amazon has sent the wrong tape and blamed it on me i ordered the original alan rickman british edition and received the very bad us edition when returning it i was tolf that i ordered the wrong thing ! ! ! i still have the order acknowledgement showing purchase of the rickman edition someone never read what was ordered and returns do not show an option of wrong tape received good by amazo
i like hairdressing this movie is abour hairdressing and professor snape is fabulous as the hairdresser and so is matt sullivan the wise cracking boy who has gone without sex for 40 days is also a hairdresser as is josie i like hairdressing do you
my son loves airplanes and jets ! i bought this dvd based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video if you want a dvd that shows flying do not buy this dvd ! the name of the video should be watch the blue angles get ready to fly '' because that is what this video is in the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying then the next 25 minutes is no flying just talking and showing the blue angles getting ready for their show in the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show my son has never made it to that point he wants to see fly and i 'm now on a new search for a dvd that will do this for him
it 's hard to believe i watched the same movie as everyone else here this movie fails on every level it is n't a good action movie or a good silly movie or a good comedy or a good satire or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags terrible dialogue weak characters vapid plot and so on there is n't anything redeeming about god of cookery do n't be fooled into thinking you 'll like it because you like shaolin soccer iron chef rumble in the bronx ong bak or almost any other show or movie to which it might be compared god of cookery is just painful feeble and empty
kings and queen '' is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and minutes to no discernible point or purpose the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen '' might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance nora 's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i do n't think so perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning
contrary to the adorers of this film i find kings and queens to be tedious and long there are a few redeeming moments in the movie but they do n't make up for its needless wandering and at times bizarre path francophiles look elsewhere
i 'm giving this dvd a 1 star not because all three episodes are crappy but because 15 is such a let down do n't get me wrong 13 and 14 are a must see but in 15 way too much is changed within the personalities of the charachcters it just seems like there are totally different writers this time episode 16 is n't quite as bad as 15 but you can tell the story has been greatly thinned out compared to the first 14 episodes
if you are allergic to movies that have an overkill of cuteness '' be sure to have a barfbag handy when you watch this one luckily i recorded it from tv skimmed to the end just to make sure it did have the required happy ending and then erased it if i had actually owned it i would have burned it
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen julia roberts and richard gere should have given every cent they received on this movie for charity ! horrible acting and plot julia and richard i hope you get to read this one day
1. make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something 2. have every scene take place in the dark and your underworld must be lit by bulbs 3. clothe everyone in black leather particularly capes this especially works for the villains but in the interest of equal play the heroes can be edgy and wear black leather too if they 're villains shave their heads give them sunglasses for the dark ! 4. copying terry gilliam 's masterpiece brazil throw something retro like brimmed fedoras into the wardrobe 5. have a premise where our hero a lone guy wakes up or somehow finds himself in a world he does not remember getting into he must clear his name of something even if it 's just getting off pottery barn 's mailing list 6. have a mysterious woman who may or may not be in cohoots with the bad guys but who falls in love with our hero and wants to save him by the end of act ii 7. make damn sure she 's sultry though blondes are generally more popular these days in hollywood here dark brunettes work best 8. have lots of issues that revolve around our brains being dicked with throw in lots of tortured dialogue about alternative substitutes 9. this is very important use the rhetorical line at least once do you know what will happen if you find the kiber to rescue your on a bright light '' indeed he and we do n't this is supposed to get us all scared and anxious 10. our hero should have had if possible a happy childhood that turned tragic slaughtered parents work great here of course he does n't remember any of it at least at first 11. populate your world with lots of machines with tubes wires cables and ducts there also should be flashes of lightning that serve no purpose 12. make sure your sets and costumes were derived '' from some black and white classic film from the or metropolis caligari even frankenstein will do nicely this is both to show you have a legitimate pedigree '' and to cover up the fact that you have no original ideas yourself 13. make sure all the bad guys bite off their dialogue and sound mean this is how we know they are bad guys since lately both sides have been wearing black leather 14. the guy gets the girl in the end and the sun comes out really now do we have to say this however through most of the movie we must believe the love will be unrequited the dame should have a troubled history though you must keep it vague 15. throw in some cyborgs you got ta have cyborgs 16. have sets that are about fifteen times larger than they need to be but which are largely empty 17. there 's always the authority figure who starts out in pursuit of our guy but who by the end becomes convinced of his innocence and moves to his side 18. there was some vague recent apocalyptic event that destroyed most of civilization but be brief here our audience may get to wondering how one guy saving one girl will restore all of civilization and you do n't want them thinking about that 19. include a sadomasochistic scene or two the current favorite is to strap the victim on a rotating mechanical device and stick him with needles this movie likes to stick them through the bone at the front of the skull a really stupid place to insert a needle but then this screenwriter clearly is n't a brain surgeon 20. always have a big climax with lots of explosions steam smoke distorting of the picture with computer tricks and loud rock music this is how we resolve things when we have no idea what the hell we 're talking about or how to end the movie we hope nobody notices generally they do n't follow this primer and whatever you come up with will be called bold and visionary by people whose filmgoing history does n't extend before 1995 and roger i do n't wan na become critically irrelevant '' ebert
the movie has great sets and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner however the acting is unconvincing the big secret is revealed at the beginning and the character development is weak
well i went to the concert and the whole time while i was watching it i was glade they where coming out with a dvd because dvd can hold lots and lots and lots of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why i would be 100 i do n't care i want to see it all and well i waited months and months wondering waiting for it to come out i went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time then it was time the p t dvd of the century thank you emi for destroying a historial document so you can get all your signed contracts on to your dvd well now all i have to do is use my time machine and get a tape ready and tape the damn concert wait time machines doe n't exist well now i am going ot have to go underground to get it but wait i still 100 will emi release all the videos on dvd or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it all i can say this is why the internet was invented for information exchange if they keep information paticularly this historical document from people they will share it over the internet the video does n't belong to 1 company it belongs to the world the world created this and who does emi think they are by limiting this i am so sick and tired of this utter b t no one should settle for this i demand more and everyone should demand more billion people watched 1 million spectaters and what does emi tell you they will put the crappiest dvd together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website i believe i shall find them all and put them up on wikipedia because it is n't 1 person who owns the worlds creation anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them every extra cent of this dvd should go to africa and it doesnt it and its a bloody shame all i can say is i am making sure this goes on to every review for this damned dvd untill something is done about it viva la ristance d real lenbo
i consider myself a beginner yogi have been to about classes over the past year and i found this video to be extremely unchallenging this video might be good for someone recovering from an injury and who has never tried yoga before although sara ivanhoe comes off as a friendly gym buddy i just could n't overcome the total lack of breath awareness that seems to be a basic part of yoga also i am not in very good shape and i did n't even break a sweat during the 'fat burning ' workout
well i guess i should 've read more reviews of this dvd it is strictly for beginners i do n't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up if i do breath of fire it helps when i want an easy day i 'll pop this in and do both sessions very simple but i 'm sure it 's good for a beginner a beginning beginner sara ivanhoe is soothing though and encouraging but seriously this is a very easy workout
there 's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book but it 's mostly emotional it 's an extremely novel and the work of a true master the film on the other hand is just your classic bad film beautiful to look at with lots of skin languid copulation heaving bosoms nonsense etc and next to no substance it has no artistic integrity whatsoever as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did i was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character the much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe and it also lacked much enthusiasm they were incomplete and contributed little if anything to the plot the viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between edward and antoinette therefore they should have either gone all the way tastefully no pun intended or have left those scenes out entirely now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book but for those who have n't read the book there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat from the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family despite the narration why did the keep laughing something vaguely explained in the movie though apparently fully explained in the book why did n't the parrot fly away what made the mother go nuts at no point in the movie were rochester 's issues '' as it were fully explained the man gets a letter exposing his wife as a creole and dumps her like a hot potato after as christophene explains he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place what a hypocrite again maybe this is the ultimate point that rochester is a snob and the archetypical victorian englishman and that antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the jamaicans but none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film so despite the beautiful cinematography this movie is a hopeless muddle i 'd highly recommend the novel by the way a book you do n't forget in a hurry needless to say i think you should give this insulting to the memory of jean rhys film a miss especially if you 've read the novel it 'll just frustrate you no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time
the novel of wide sargasso sea was decent book a of jane eyre 's bertha but the film is really hard to tolerate it starts out although it seems to start deviating from the book early on past the point where antoinette marries rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too
i was dispointed from seying this movie after seing wild orchid movies 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting wide sargo sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it the course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee i did not get the point of this movie it 's worth renting but i certainly would not buy it
nicholas cage is incapable of bringing any reality to this otherwise very dark and serious story of a man becoming psychotically obsessed with thinking he is a vampire cage used to make quirky movies good raising arizona but here his complete acting inability ruins a film the audience can see that his interactions with a vampiress and subsequent rampage is what is called 'pyschotic delusions ' but the film is brilliant when it shows that even cage 's conversations with his shrink may be imagined he is over the top and out of context worst accent imaginable the concept of a man having an alternate universe that may in fact be real is not unique and runs through horror the shining them 12 monkeys etc this film is a near twin of a american werewolf in london this is such a near miss though the murders and murder of an insane and suicidal man should be a very sad story but cage makes it hollow 'wolf ' is somewhat of a remake if 'remake ' is to take a flawed film and find ways to make it worse if this is the journal of a madman cage seems to think he is in a comedy if it is a comedy it is not funny
i am a fan of vampire movies and collect them from humorous to frightening this movie was a let down this was exactly what i would expect to find in a bargain bin but definitely not at the price it is offered here i am also a nicolas cage fan i collect movies he stars in and so far until this movie arrived i ca n't say that i was ever let down by one of them to say this was a bit bizzare is an understatement you never really know if he is just crazy and imaging things or if it is really happening to him it is hokie to the point of not being humorous just very bad my daughter loves hokie and even she walked out the room even though i suffered until the end i bought this based on the fact that it is a vampire movie and nicolas cage stars in it even the trailer for this movie had to be edited in a way to make it sound interesting if you watch it you will notice how scenes were taken out of content to make it look better than it really was throughout the movie nicholas cage had an on again off again accent that sounded like it was suppose to be british word of advice do n't waste your money
i agree with june 26 review i am going to say it better her instruction ! most irritating is the fact that she yells ! i do n't find that particuliarly motivating in fact '' i find it quite distracting '' can you hear me now ! ! and the moving all over the 'friggin ' place as she is lifting also distracting and nerve racking to say the least i was never a fan of hers anyway but i needed a routine and still do now for a free weights program this definitely 4 me that is is n't it if i did n't mind paying shipping and handling again i send it back to the seller bless ole ' heart they got it to me sooo fast with no expectation of a refund that 's right they could have this s ! back fuh ' free ! ! !
this was one of the worst tapes i have ever is no quik fix think kathy smith is that good of an break this workout down into two parts i like that sort of did the whole 60 minute tape i was not think she is not clear with her in the day kathy smith even use is just trying to copy the like her old tapes thought this was terrible and i would not do it again
i love the but this box set left me disappointed the description stating dolby digital 2.0 for the audio track is misleading since the audio is in mono not stereo i was also hoping there would be some '' extras in the set in addition to just the episodes
it 's a little known fact but george peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series frequently did not get along with his particularly and hate the child scripts that stephen candell would turn out each week it 's easy to see why two of the actors and dirk benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in 1985. dwight schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various tv movies and films so he at least had some acting talent to speak of but really the only real star of this series was george peppard and his more memmorial tv work should be as the private insurance investigator benecheck
but is is not the truth since the wall fell we have learned that old joe was right hey i bet in a few years clooney will make a film about how honest and truthful bill clinton was
the lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real edward murrow and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the but otherwise i 'd did n't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short boring movie that seemed much longer maybe i 've just seen too many biopics lately
this movie was terrible the only reason im giving it any stars is because i love tupac but thats movie basically has no story line if you want to see a good tupac movie then you go buy juice i think u will enjoy that alot more than u will in this movi
the story of ruth is the telling of the story of ruth the grandmother of king david versus goliath etc and an ancestor of jesus christ himself unfortunately the film ends up being a very badly missed opportunity to make a great bible movie but it fails miserably by missing the overall message despite its attention to other bible verses and historical details ! the cast costumes and sets are all great the problem is the writing they spend the first hour making up a origin for ruth as an orphaned girl sold to the cult of chemosh in moab she grows to adulthood as a priestess in a cult that sacrifices a child to a stone statue annually the movie introduces many characters named in the bible 's book of ruth naomi is the mother of mahlon mahlon is a statue artisan who repairs chemosh statues even though he is repelled by the concept of child sacrifice ruth learns about the god of israel from the israelite named mahlon and they marry sort of after an hour 's worth of dramatic plot twists which all have nothing to do with the bible story of ruth maybe it all could have been a reasonable setup for ruth 's origin if only the second hour would have finally brought out the correct bible story instead the second hour is so that boaz has a modern romantic tension between himself and ruth while ruth is being courted by her legal in the bible this unnamed wants ruth but quickly declines when boaz reminds him that he will be raising a heritage for the deceased mahlon ruth and boaz finally end up right but the story inbetween is foolishly so this movie ultimately fails as a bible story retelling a major element in the second hour is that ruth is accused of being an idolator a former priestess of chemosh and the people protest for her death sentence the film has lots of small bible verses portrayed correctly but it totally screws up the major story arc they show the scene and dialogue when ruth decides to join naomi to return to her homeland and naomi 's god will be ruth 's god etc they also show other details like exchanging sandals as part of a business deal which is in the bible and one of my favorite amusing ancient cultural moments in scripture the movie has many of the pieces but the puzzle is not put together to resemble the bible story not nearly enough it is strange that the film makers seemed to have done their homework so well concerning the culture of the moabites who worship chemosh but then they screw up the simple story of ruth from the actual bible which is the name of the darn movie in the first place ! there is a much better ruth story on dvd which is an animated claymation 30 minute story but is totally accurate to the bible ! testament the bible in animation ruth 1996 this animated version of ruth is super cute as well as super faithful to the actual bible story and details this animated dvd is excellent and worth your time and money if you like the cute claymation style of rudolph the red nosed reindeer and the little drummer boy chrismas classics then you will love this animated ruth dvd ! get that instead ! the story of ruth this dvd is only of interest to the most hardcore bible dvd collector who needs to have it on their dvd shelf it will gather dust
major disappointment maynard 's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his into this pile of dung just because he can not only was this completely rushed and way i found it odd that in a chat with maynard on october 29 2003 he stated the following regarding the step i 'm not thinking about that right now i 'm on the delivery table crowning breathing hard delivering my new baby and you 're asking me if i 'm going to have another baby someday '' but yet emotive was rushed to be released in time for 2004 elections maybe keenan should heed his own advice you are always responsible for your own actions so choose them wisely ''
think of the most pretentious thing you can please but think carefully think along the lines of that red haired woman who appears and talks rubbish occasionally on critical mass or of geraldine doogue sic discussing the afterlife on compass with some vicars sorry non australian readers ! then double that level of pretension and you 'll be approaching the near toxic amounts of utter codswallop to be seen on this maynard james keenan 's latest excursion into the world of pointless obscurism look matey like it or not this is heavy metal therefore i want no i need explosions lots of lights walls of marshalls and some gratuitous blood this has none of those things just a short little whiny man in a wig boring the pants off of everyone who comes into contact with him of course if you 're a fan you 'll lap up every second but you 'll get what you deserve i promise
i was very disappointed in this movie i thought it was slow moving and found myself contunually calling up the display to see how much longer it lasted the grandfather has such a heavy accent that i missed a lot of what he was saying but did n't want to drag out the movie by playing it back i have seen many fantasies in my time but this one left me cold did n't like ! i was sure glad i had gotten it from the library and not bought it
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind but it was a mess
who ripped off who emma or clueless the entire time i 'm watching this movie i 'm wondering when alicia silverstone is going to pop up i keep thinking there 's got to be something different coming up '' but no it was pretty much the same exact plotline i love gwyneth but i was not impressed with emma
i hate to give emma one star because i think paltrow 's performance is flawless and love that british accent she piles on but emma was so boring pretentious and completely dowdy as can be i guess the language just threw me for a loop too wordy bland and pointless to me it 's a shame because i thought emma was going to be a great film damn those critics ! sorry gwyneth you are a great and talented actress but there is nothing to swoon over this drab film i recommend some other paltrow films instead shallow hall sylvia proof and sliding doors welcome back british accent ! emma will have you drowsy after the first thirty minutes yawn ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this production is okay not a complete waste of time but not great either overall the script is a very shallow translation of the book particularly regarding jane fairfax and frank churchill though ewan mcgregor is pretty forgettable as frank churchill partly because of the script and toni collette seems to be less harriet smith and more forrest gump at some points there are still some excellent performances gwyneth paltrow does well with the material such as it is and she works well with jeremy northam knightly i especially enjoyed juliet stevenson as elton and the mother and daughter team of phyllida law and sophie thompson as and miss bates overall this production looks pretty but it 's austen for the masses people who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and are n't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it for the rest of us i recommend the production of emma staring kate beckinsdale
this dvd was released everywhere in the world with the rare tv special sports goofy in soccormania '' a 30 min special it was removed from the american release why they did this is unknown the dvd lost 30 min and we lost a rare cartoon the rest of the world gets but not america ! thanks alot disney
i was hoping that socermania '' would be on the extreme sports fun '' dvd but no ! instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures '' this also goes for the other two dvd 's extreme music and adventure fun allthough 'pluto 's blue note ' 'donald 's dilemma ' 'no sail ' 'old sequoia ' and 'trailer horn ' are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities '' and the chronological donald volume 2 '' which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration who needs these dvds so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd 's and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration
in this classical romeo and juliet tale tita lumi cavazos and pedro leonardi seem destined to marry until her mother elena regina torne forbids it because of some silly family tradition tita the youngest is to take care of elena until she dies so she marries pedro off to her daughter rosaura yareli arizmendi pedro 's reasoning is that he can be near tita but it presents a host of problems tragedies beset this family as well the lovers though overcome all of it and after rosaura 's death finally have the chance to express their love for each other but how tragic so enters fate this is a foreign film with english subtitles and this review refers to the 105 minute dvd at first i gave it two stars but it 's perhaps a four star movie for drama and effects but beware of nudity
film 4.5 stars dvd 0 stars dvd released march 2000 this is a very good albeit not great film whose dvd release has been ruined by disney as they so often do 18 ! minutes deleted from the theatrically released version transfer it 's been over six years since the dvd was released one can only hope that an version is in the works however based on disney 's track record and on the quality of their marketing wizards '' i 'm not holding my breath do n't know if disney licenses to criterion but if so that may be the only way we get a decent dvd release
laura esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate magical novel lumi cavazos is a likeable tita struggling with her forbidden passion for 's a sympathetic character conveys her pain with her a talented actress i wonder what has become of her since marco leonardi is not as sympathetic as comes across as a cheating scoundrel causing pain for both his wife his forbidden wonders why tita loves him so much except that it 's leonardi is however being true to the uses tita for his own pleasure instead of bravely marrying her he is a coward in marrying her sister cheating on her the movie renders less magical or powerful the scenes in the of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti expects to see john wayne riding to tita 's rescue the magical scenes are hardly convincing even for their movie does have an excellent 's far inferior to the delectable sensual novel
this set was a gift i was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced no artwork on the dvd no artwork on the inside of the cases the worst of all is the fact that universal markets these sets as complete uncut '' they are not uncut last salute to the commodore '' is missing more than 10 minutes of footage in the commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program that is common now but not in the commodore '' runs just over 95 minutes in a 2 hour slot that leaves 25 minutes for commercials as i said not in the the show is very jumpy because of the cuts each of these episodes is heavily cut up if you do n't mind chopped up episodes and cheaply done packaging this set is for you otherwise look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers universal deserves no one 's loyalty universal is home of vast numbers of greed merchants
saw the previews of the first movie but i was n't expecting too much from that i tried to finish both the first and the second but that did n't work out too well i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie and that includes the first all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
tyrese gibson for worst actor ever up to this point i 've been a huge paul walker fan for his comedically bad acting he 's made a career of it in this one his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word bro '' at least 75 times to give his character street cred and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops it 's clear walker is deeply considering his plight but really walker ca n't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of tyrese gibson my god where did they find this guy the movie would 've been ok as a standard mindless action film but it really was ruined by the grade drama club acting now you might be wonderning who 's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie but wait there 's actually method to this madness since their was no vin diesel the director knew he had only paul walker left and it 's well known that walker can not carry a film see timeline '' so what to do of course ! find an actor even worse than walker and cast them together ! all of the sudden walker does n't look so terrible because everyone 's focusing on this other chump and apparently it worked because a lot of people enjoyed this film and there 's even a sequel
one hell of a waste of money ! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like i was you are in for a hell of a disappointment ! the only reason why i think the first one was bad ass is cause vin diesel was in it and yeah it was totally bad ass ! i 'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed in this movie you get two real cars this time a 1969 camaro ss and a 1970 dodge challenger and they both get destroyed ! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars ! god all mighty ! do n't waste your money on this movie i would n't take this disappointment if it was given to me ! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie buy frost bite ! you wo n't be disappointed
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert
first of all i am a joy division and new order fan therefore i tried to like this really i did sadly this film stinks the focus is not on the bands themselves but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life maybe i 'm not british but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny only a few scenes made me grin the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film in addition the camera work was very jerky looked like it was done by a novice and yes i 'm one myself having made two movies the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division too bad the members of this band are minor characters i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much much better
do n't let the cover fool you this film is n't half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it 's my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove '' or at least something interesting to watch and it 's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i would n't call this bad it had it 's good parts just not many
party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung if best in show was not enough that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the brit wave and michael winterbottom could have exposed the in a much better way my main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should the rise of factory i did really enjoy the joy division segments though even if exploiting ian curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste unless you 're a fan of the brit explosion of the era and an extreme fan at that i could not recommend this film it 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into
talentless people and garbage music torture you in this no time flat you 'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' out into the not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc can turn candy into cuisine
i purchased this dvd and could not get it to play in my dvd player i sent it back for exchange and received another identical disk that it too would not play i sent it back for a refund and was never able to view it i never thought to try it in my computer bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue oddly the dvd has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all dvd players in the
all these shows are the syndicated are at least 3 min cut from each sucks big time for releasing edited shows not the first time see soap other seasons of good times mine back and got a refund
worst movie ever the creture on the front cover is not even in the movie you do not see the monster which is a beast until the last 15 minutes do not waste your money on this home made movie please take my word for it it is that bad the majority of the movie is talking
simply put i did n't like it emma thompson was too old to play a 19 year old not only did the movie leave out change alot of what was written in the book the movie left out changed the characters so once again i must say i did n't like
having a curiosity in the entertainment that kids and teens are being given today i happened to watch this film on tv a few days ago i could be biased and say that movies are n't what they use to be for kids but this movie went beyond that this film is a depressing example of how horribly some of today 's youth is growing up i would not recommend this film in anyway unless for laughs at its stupidity the film starts off with our four 'rich girl ' characters strutting down the street with arrogance beyond words the arrogance perhaps a normal thing for some teenagers however these girls do appear to be filthy rich of which very few kids could relate to leaving them to wonder why ca n't they be rich little kids too the goal of these girls of course to become famous an unrealistic dream for most but it seems to be a moral to the film to have a good life you need to become famous '' the plot moral not a great one the characters little lessons appalling 'raven ' is so caught up in the 'becoming a ' experience that she becomes completely this is probably one of the few morals that are presented well do n't become a idiot moving on our second character fails entirely at bringing in any good ideals after some time working on 'the cheetah girls ' upcoming career she comes home to throw a tantrum about her mother not being there rather she 's out with a boyfriend the agent rings about her mother 's interest in selling the house the daughter picks up the phone rudely yelling to the agent how this house is not for sale 'because i say so ' in pure teen angst now she decides to go out and abuse her mother 's credit card for all the money it 's worth because of this small episode of course when mum comes home she is not happy but apparently it 's all ok when the daughter cries out about how her mother should be there more for her perhaps if this were a real case of this may be but this kid was just a selfish brat who needs to find better ways to get over minor issues i really hope kids wo n't think its ok to throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents had to go out the next character is perhaps the most insulting to the 'real world ' raven makes an occasional comment to this character about how trashy their fashion looks and yes their fashion looks perfectly fine actually later in the film we realise that our 'trashy ' girl is actually an orphan living in a poor foster home it 's a good idea however this girl looks nothing like a real 'poor ' girl perhaps a 'money is n't everything ' moral would have fitted nicely here but instead we 're handed the perfect fix get your rich friends to buy your clothes the forth character i wo n't comment on as i ca n't remember anything significant about her the process of becoming of course is very unrealistic aside the factor and the 'the cheetah girls ' are torn between following their original dream or just to get the exposure their friendship hangs on the line because of this as raven refuses to compromise we are given a few inspiring quotes from other characters about which road raven should take on this matter then its all up to the wonderful climax to do the rest the climax toto has fallen in a hole and has got dirty horrifying experience for a dog bearing a perly white coat poor raven is so frantic this is obviously the worst kind of tragedy that could happen in life god forbid we learn anything realistic like the death of a family member or even of this poor little pooch perhaps in that case we 'd even had the president of the united states turning up to comfort raven but no it 's just a dirty dog stuck in a hole it only calls for the whole neighbourhood police fire fights and the local television news crew such a tragedy can only resolve in the reconciled friendship of 'the cheetah girls ' and there we have it entertainment maybe any benefits otherwise i would personally hope not as they 're not the kind of things i would like to see in kids and teenagers these days normally if this film was aimed at a higher audience ha i would n't see as much of a problem with it but this was a disney film you know the ones that are meant to be inspiring to kids or at least teach them some values in life this just gave us an insight to disney 's own greedy mind
this was one of the worst group performances i have ever seen ! unbelievable that disney has financed this hack act '' and the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of disney save your money for a better movie
this movie has no plot it rips off the books this movie would n't be popular if raven was n't in it they think everything is a big deal and galleria is really stupid read the books and do n't bother with this annoying movie
i 'm not sure which is the concept of the bar coyote ugly '' or the movie about it i suppose both a lot is made about piper parabo 's performance as it were but i just do n't see it i mean you 'd have to be able to act to receive such an accolade and in this movie parabo is a strident sell a little t and a as far as one can becoming a stripper with as much a grasp on the real world as grader the movie is a toy for high age mopes who find places where the worst kept secret in the bar hiring hotties to sucker young naiive men into spending money they ca n't interesting places to hang out at this is cocktail '' in reverse to an extent this is one of those movies that creates a pure utopia of a bar the place where everyone basically laughs cheers and sings in unison at a contrived silly atmosphere that only exists in the minds of hollywood execs and college campuses to a much lesser extent the dialogue to is equal to that of coctail '' pointless been there before dense dialogue if you 're young and have yet to be in touch with real life see this it 's a fantasy flick for escapism if you 're a quality film lover run the other way
okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around there is supposedly some kind of moral to this story the only moral i can see is when you do n't have a big enough brain use your bod to get ahead screw college screw learning there is more to you then your looks looks do n't fade they last forever ! right my boyfriend does n't understand why i do n't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want being judged as nothing but a body and no more any thinking woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it either it is not a good example for the young women of today
this is the kind of film i get stuck watching on long plane rides and would never seek myself it is such silly schlock that i marvel at how the hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money it 's really an industrial production process geared to superficial viewers this is one of the basic plots the others include crippled boy whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk love or talk why do we keep watching this junk a video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome ok here goes beautiful girl with a dream seeking big break gets gig in a bar handles it meets boy who does n't fit into plans shakes it shakes it more shakes it a lot more flirts with corruption stays course makes real friends gets to know real self grows oh and then succeeds on her own terms not recommended admittedly the acting in not abysmal but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist
this is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them i absolutely hate these type of flicks hey with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you i found myself looking for women in the bar none this is just pig s you are a jerk if you think this is cool needless to say i did not care for it and i very much appreciate hot women do n't get me wrong this just sucked
i can not believe someone would come here and say its the best dvd ever and the best thing on tv in the past 50 years ! i should sue that guy for my money back ! talk about obsessive fans who need to get a life ! ! the dvd its a concert of a very young girl named hayley westerna from new zealand that much should be obvious from the title there are some good songs like both sides now and amazing grace and others i cant recall right away mostly its very boring her voice is pretty for certain and its a classy production and yet i was yawning throughout the whole thing a guy did a duet with her and did his best to yell instead of sing you have to see it to believe it he yelled throughout the whole song i had to turn the volume down by half just so it was bearable now i am upset about purchasing this thinking it was going to be this grand musical experience according to prior posters one whose name i wont utter but should be ashamed upset to put it very very mildly best dvd ever best thing on tv in the past 50 years right ! ! ! ! those extremist reviewers who have no life should not be allowed to post on here and i mean it almost half the songs were nice to listen to and the singer has a pleasant voice so i give it 2.5 stars oh the extras if you like there is a documentary on her and some really badly done videos
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by gate this film is tepid there is none of the satanic that you find in 'rosemary 's baby ' it 's too hollywood surprisingly considering the maverick presence of film opens well with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 which i was equally disappointed in at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil ' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball considering he was the and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film rent it only buy angel heart instead
maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat '' on top of that the acting was horrible this movie did n't take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor
other reviewers who detail the silly and are right this is ford 's jack ryan was sometimes a step behind but in a believable way the audience was right beside ryan and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action boy did he take action ben affleck 's jack ryan is terminally lost pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive or at least interesting this is going to go down as the star wars prequel '' of clancy movies the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism by female director heckerling ! she duplicated it in chevy chase vehicle national lampoon 's european vacation too ! many child actors got their start here but the thing that cracked me up as i saw it when it came out nately was the dialog of my fav band cheap trick ticket scalper the magntism of robin zander and the charisma of rick nielsen and what about the tunes 'i want you to want me the dream police 'you 're momma 's alright your daddy's alright they just seem a little weird surrender surrender '' before he 's interrupted if that is n't somebody's idea of 'surrender ' they 've stumbled onto this review by mistake
wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself wo n't enjoy two womanizers fall in love one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin like first off what does virginity have to do with love second who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin then owen wilson 's character fall in love with rachel 's mcadams character and well that 's the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it 's not that funny it seems to think it 's better then it is i do n't think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive '' gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course because it 's this kind of film he ends up being gay and of course he tries to hit on vince vaughn 's character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay '' guy is prob one of the worst actors i 've seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell alot of people i know find this guy so '' funny but i do n't get it it just was n't funny to me u know i loved the classic american pie '' that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy ! this film was n't so much funny as stupid for the most part i 'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it 's just an average film
since the credits indicate the screenplay was written by delpy and hawke along with linklater maybe it 's too much to expect that actors would be able to accurately write about real and interesting people while delpy 's celine does have a few sparks of genuine insight learning who you really are when you 're not distracted by tv shopping etc hawke 's jesse relies too much on cliches marriage because of pregnancy eventually becomes bad marriage with sex delpy at least appeared to try to play a flawed but genuine celine whereas hawke 's jesse was just too cool he looked like he had adhd and could barely wait for her to finish her lines so he could throw out his single entendres i agree with the other reviewer who thought the movie felt like a painfully long and awkward date what 's so irritating about movies like this is how they try to make real life '' seem so meaningless while idealizing some unattainable fantasy like somehow it 's more romantic to experience a few hours of happiness with a complete stranger every years while you marry and spend your life with someone you do n't really love ugghhh ! ! ! if you want to watch a movie about dysfunctional people then mike nichol 's closer '' where flawed but interesting characters are portrayed with sometimes painful realism closer does n't try to romanticize the love of your life '' but rather show that what people expect from love may differ maybe linklater delpy and hawke have never experienced real love which is why they ca n't really write about it
i bought this without previously knowing anything about it not knowing it was a sequel i was taken in by the title and the blurb that 's it it sounded like a really romantic film one that i might identify with as i 've always wondered what would happen if i met my first love again if i would have the same feelings after watching the very very long trailer i was slightly disappointed and i only managed to half an hour into the film before i started to doze off it 's so incredibly boring ! and although i would n't say i normally mind real time '' films it 's all set in the afternoon a very dull time of day if you ask me it was the only time of day director richard linklater would shoot the scenes in the film he felt it added to the reality of the film and often relied on the actors to get perfect takes at the right time and it shows as it was shot in a mere 15 days but it 's nothing but talk and meandering around parisian streets in the parts i watched i just did n't identify with it nothing happened and i hated the two actors i do n't normally like ethan hawke anyway but i thought i might be able to ignore this but no i disliked julie delpy too i would n't recommend this film to anyone although i know other reviewers are gon na disagree with me but it just was n't what i expected
when they originally aired this sullivan christmas special on network television a few years ago it was packed with oldie rock 'n roll clips as well as old sullivan holiday clips on the tv special were classic performances by neil diamond the animals petula clark sam dave etc etc for some reason they wiped all of those great clips and left only the performances on the dvd release on other sullivan dvd releases they released pretty much the same content as the tv specials i cry foul on this one !
a work of fiction is a great thing but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong why not just make up a story with no historical basis
to borrow from a previous reviewer a movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering
i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor and fanatic as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the conflict she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary 's great desire and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just does n't cut it
i was excited to see this until i found out which movies would be included weird science come on it should have been the breakfast club pretty in pink and elmo 's fire
there is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary it is well presented with great cgis narration and overall structure hence it is worth at least two stars whatever this stars rating business means the problem is the substance it is simply not there menzies is one of those as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it i think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence menzies starts off with his conclusion rather than ending with it and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it when all alleged evidence is demolished he arrogantly states that he will not budge one millimetre '' as he puts it from his theory and that in time everyone will accept it as a fact that the chinese were the first to discover america a true scientist even in the presence of evidence substantiating viewpoint always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future menzies does exactly the opposite with no evidence on his side he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong it saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea menzies not a scientist but at best a qualified mariner managed to make a buck on his book and that pbs helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him the feeling one gets at the end is that pbs ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap 's whilst visually pleasing this pbs production is in substance a waste of time to watch as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer
i 've been a fan of the who since i recieved my copy of tommy on vinyl in 1970 for christmas i resisted buying this dvd set for a long time because of the price and knowing that if it was a current release that townshend would be playing an accoustic guitar while someone backstage would be playing what he should be he started doing this due to hearing loss years ago the who hasnt been the same since watching the tommy performance will make you seasick its so out of sync it just goes to show that some publishers and performers will let anything out the door to make another buck i had just moved to las vegas when entwhistle died there of a cocaine overdose it was somehow prophetic in a way i didnt have tickets for their show that week but i thought with his death it wouldnt have happened anyway surprisingly it did its all about if you 've never seen this band in its heyday go get a copy of their live at the isle of wight festival show or woodstock for a second choice and see what this band was really like and shame on the people who let this recording hit the shelves i hope they choke on the money
in both performances the mix has rendered john entwistle 's bass inaudible it sucks the only place you can hear it is during the solos in underture from tommy and from quadrophenia i saw the live performances and the bass cuts through like a 747 going overhead it does n't on the dvd infact you would n't even know entwistle 's there john
these are not the original theatrical realeases in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels though they are an impressive technical achievement i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger
note this review is not about the trilogy which is great this review is about the many dvd releases the worst thing that ever happened to george lucas is when peter jackson released the extended version of lotr jackson showed fans we could demand expect and receive more from hollywood the impact of peter jackson sent shock waves among fans who released a edition of one of the greatest movies of all time even old hollywood guards like ridley scott and james cameron no surprise they are not americans took notice and improved their dvd releases this change has been powerful except in the case of lucas and to some degree his pal steven spielberg who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers the many shows greediness stubbornness and lack of respect for fans no one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality in addition please stop using the limited edition '' you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of star wars it is both false and tiring release these films in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release lucas 's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his star war movies unfortunately his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar his shady practice of releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him one must wonder what went through lucas mind when peter jackson won an academy award for best director and not him maybe if he focus on making quality films like he once did and not playing the dvd game then he could win one
ug i really dislike this movie dune is one of my favorite books and this movie totally ruined it it is boring confusing unfaithful to the book and just plain badly done if you want to see the real dune watch the amazing miniseries done by channel and it 's sequel children of dune both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material
do n't be fooled ! ! ! ! the page states that david lynch directed this but he actually took his name off look at the screen shot this extended edition was directed by alan smithee do n't worry though it gets worse i do n't normally write reviews but i feel compelled to in this case so here it goes first off i loved the books and david lynch 's interpretation in the theatrical release that being said this is just aweful i totally agree with those who have stated that this is an abomination cons include but are not limited to good scenes cut from the theatrical bad voice over with storyboards for much of the 'extra footage' uneven quality and clumsy transitions to new material the list goes on do yourself a favor and do n't spend the money on this just get the theatrical release and be happy if you did n't like david lynch 's interpretation then just take the time and pleasure to read the book again i ca n't believe they actually released this i totally understand david lynch taking his name off of this
what were they thinking ! there are actually scenes deleted from the original theatrical release ! ! the extended edition is an abomination '' if there ever were one furthermore i discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product seek out the original release because i believe the original '' release included in this set is not of the same quality david lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition
the extended version of the film has some serious problems i bought this dvd after waiting years for a more complete version to come out sadly side two of this single disc release has some serious errors around halfway through the film my copy would pause for a few minutes eventually skip forward pause play pause skip forward and then it would eventually play normally with a few more pauses after looking online i found that this problem seems to be very common due to how the disc was made so to wrap this up i 'm a fan of the movie but this dvd is sold to you broken thanks to universal studios messing it up
this is intimidatingly fast paced but i suppose it has to be since it 's over instantaneously you barely have time to think about working up a sweat and already the end credits are rolling by i 'm too uncoordinated to benefit from this i prefer the ellen barrett led crunch dvds and the firm series
whoa ! what flimsy piece of television journalism this biography episode manages to make the life of juilia child boring and dull my guess is that the producer has never cooked a meal in life and thinks of julia child a big lady with a funny voice please just by julia 's my life in france autobiograpy it 's a fast inspiring read any night and day from this hackish disservice to one of the most important figures in american culinary history
i love columbo i have seasons 1 2 3 and 4. season three is the only set on double sided dvds as far as i can tell it freezes and locks up on all my dvd players in the house this needs to be made into a 4 disk set universal should redo this season and give everyone a swap out this should be like a recall with no questions asked if i had to do it over i would not buy the third season with all that said the episodes are just great
pushing the envelope for explicit over the counter home videos 9 songs tartan is about one year of sex and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers matt is a young glaciologist he meets lisa at a london rock concert that night they start an affair in between attending more concerts they make passionate love it 's for real and explicit nine song footage is intercut with their sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship and finally all this takes place in the memory of matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the south pole this unscripted film is part musical part drama part documentary and part performance it raises questions about the difference between pornography and art controversial and much buzzed about this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been and of course the sex a special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances
well if this movie had a story then i must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it they do n't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that 's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking as one of the reviewer declared about 2 people having sex i do n't recommend it
this may be entitled warner classic holiday collection '' but warner had nothing to do with the production or distribution of boys town men of boys town or the 1938 christmas carol louis mayer may return to haunt the christmases of those heretics against the one true religion of mgm who purloined spencer tracey mickey rooney and ann rutherford to enrich the reputations of harry jack abe and ted
i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance '' never had contestants who mastered it
robin trower has really lost a lot of his playing ability same sound but no blazing licks and just a lot of trickery two stars for the music and his new vocalist is quite good
i bought this because it is made by cannon movie tales and i love puss in boots '' which they also made because puss in boots '' was so good i thought this would be too alas i was disappointed red riding hood '' has almost no relation to the story we are all familiar with the plot in the actual fairytale is more of a parenthetical remark than the main story line in this movie add to this that the acting was rather painful and the special effects were anything but special and you are left with 1 star the one thing it had going for it was that it was perfectly clean and not very scary for youngsters since small children are easier to please in the cinematic area than adults perhaps they would still enjoy this adaptation to little red riding hood ''
absolutely terrible the most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of dane cook nothing happens in this movie and i mean nothing except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging comic '' glances and looking withdrawn and cynical i do n't think a soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better so on that point it 's a success all the sullen understated lines and glances are supposed to be 're not they 're boring somebody needs to tell wes anderson that too asap
it was very disappointing to see major actors cinematographers and editors doing a good job with decidedly material the film looks much much better than its story one begins to have doubts when this family of geniuses '' reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction the paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes despite her promotion as a prodigy '' the purported love triangle has no apparent basis in other words the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence the problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional creative writers characters must be shown to be interesting '' conflicted '' '' suicidal '' etc by their words and actions not simply because we are told they are this can only be accomplished by subtle and clever writing which is wholly absent here
i think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy i do n't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim especially about how it 's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character but being in a liberal arts college i have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following the characters and the situations remind me of the short stories i would write in the sixth grade when i was around 12 years old where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you 're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating inane nonsense the whole movie feels like ones self trying to write about adult problems that they 're distanced from yet infatuated by this movie appeals to the type of people who like to read catcher and the rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their but more like i 'm so sad 'cause i do n't have a girlfriend '' lives into some sort of literary wellspring i think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing it 's unfortunate he ca n't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic subtle '' messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say hipster drivel look for something else to watch
the first few times i saw this film i thought it was great the use of music the color the sets i thought they were all wonderful then i saw films by the directors anderson was copying now immitation is the sincerest form of flattery and this is prevelant in the coen brothers ' first 8 films but anderons just relies on the ideas of others hoping people will buy them as his own the use of the seemingly lifeless a french new wave director you got it the use of so all in all this is basically anderon 's hey look at the directors i like and watch me try to copy them '' film
despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial writer did moonstruck but this is rod steiger with this material is a case is a joke the characters are impossibly lame and the dialogue would gag a film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the bankok just watched this film and at the conclusion i just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film keitel kline steiger and rickman try and forget this dog their entire lives i can not imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the i gotten the point accross that the film is weak hope i could give it zero stars or even better minus eleven stars i would
wow what a stinker ! kevin kline harvey keitel and alan rickman ca n't save this movie poorly written poorly directed and terribly acted one would expect rod steiger to go over the top but danny aiello is just as bad stay away from this i paid about 2 for the dvd and felt i overpaid hard to believe i wasted perfectly good electricity to witness this drivel did i mention the movie was lousy
it 's difficult to believe that john patrick shanley shortly after winning an oscar for moonstruck '' penned this abominable movie what was he thinking the january man '' tries to be a comedy a mystery a romance and a thriller but it fails miserably on all levels with an cast including kevin kline alan rickman rod steiger susan sarandon and harvey keitel you 'd think this would be a gem alas it 's just a big mess with an implausible storyline awful dialogue and no chemistry between the actors it 's rare and appalling to see so much talent produce so poor of a movie
i 'll tell you the truth i purchased this film only so i could say i now own every movie alan rickman has ever done he as any fan will tell you brings vivid life to every character he does his portrayal of ed the artist is absolutely what i expected well done although the part was small now for the rest of the movie i have never witnessed overacting like this in my life not even on the high school stage the plot was thin and disjointed what do virgo prime numbers and neil sedaka all have in common did i miss something and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting i 've seen i 've given it two stars strictly because of alan rickman 's involvement in the film and because i did stick it out until the end if you are a fan rent this just to hear him say do n't molest ''
what in the world happened with this clunker you have a script from oscar winning writer john patrick shanley moonstruck a cast any director would die for and an initially interesting premise but even with all that the january man is not a good movie shanley 's script is so disjointed and the only attempt at comedy seems to be kline 's physical confrontation with the killer it takes the movie at least thirty minutes to focus on the killings and even then it plods along shanley may have tried to hard to force the genres to work and it shows and director pat o'connor should be required to do community service for his mishandling of this talented cast kevin kline usually a strong presence in any film plays nick starkey like it was an after school special bland unfocused and murky susan sarandon who has won an oscar tries to be a kind of julia roberts femme fatale but she 's about as seductive as a seahorse rod steiger and danny aiello overact so badly it 's hard to believe these gentlemen have given us such good work in the past harvey keitel needs to play villains if this is how he chooses to embody a good guy '' for a change alan rickman 's ed is stereotypical artiste but he at least adds some needed color to the movie and mary elizabeth mastroantonio is pathetically dull and lethargic the january man could have been a good thriller but under o'connor 's awful direction and shanley 's poorly developed script it merely becomes one of those classic examples of a good movie gone bad
comedy thriller suspense i guess that these are all words or genres that you could use to describe this film i would use these words if i wanted to gloss over the true feeling of this film i would use these words if i had to sell this film to a distributor who did n't know any better i would use these words lightly because if i ever believed them the battle would be forever lost this was not a comedy it was not a thriller it definitely was not a suspense so what was it after viewing this film i came to the conclusion that the january man reminded me of a puzzle put together by a while all the pieces were in the box to put together sadly the infant size brain of the child chose to smash the pieces together instead of place them in corresponding orders thus you have a jumbled mess with wedged pieces of what could have been an overall beautiful picture with poor acting a confusing plot that literally went nowhere and an ending that felt forced and premature one can see that this puzzle is unfixable by even the best puzzler in the world if i were those involved with the creation i would definitely be ashamed to begin what was wrong with the actors nobody seemed like they were giving 10 much less 50 of their effort for this film even the great ones like keitel kline and sarandon felt like they were walking through the motions with equally confused eyes and hearts kline 's new york accent faded in and out throughout the film giving us no glimpse of his actual character his role was never fully defined so the other half of the time that we watch him on screen we just do n't care about him at all this was one of the worst leading characters of all time thankfully a completely miscast team that seemed more interested in the money than actually acting '' backs him up keitel was horrible in this film i am a huge fan of his body of work but in this one he walked talked and gave those emotionless eyes a rest he provided nothing of value to this production the same can be said about sarandon whose character seemed unfocused and undervalued and mary elizabeth mastrantonio who never really got her feet wet in hollywood until maid marion arrived at her doorstep alan rickman was wasted as well as the voices of danny aiello and rod steiger whose only direction from pat o'conner was to yell in other words if you are interested in seeing this film for the acting you will be greatly disappointed second perhaps the acting can be overlooked by a strong story line wrong ! this was the most convoluted script that i have ever seen hollywood produce we spend the first forty minutes learning about an event that happened two years ago that is never fully explained anyway it reminded of those times that the teacher would say in class that we should all listen up because this was n't going to be on the test then why bother this set the spiraling downfall for the rest of the film this unavailable information also lead to some pretty choppy chemistry between the actors i never say kline and keitel as brothers i never saw the relationship with sarandon possible in fact now that i think about it i did n't see any of the actors meshing well together because they were working with a script that was focused on all the wrong parts eventually the january man gets so caught up on this secondary story that we find ourselves rushed into an ending and a solution that seems laughable instead of plausible we even have a villain that is so confusing that i do n't even think he knew what he was doing in the film the final thirty minutes of this film were the worst parts of this movie second to all the parts before that whoever wrote this script must have just forgotten the basic rules of storytelling because nothing meshed well at all finally i would have to comment that the marketing for this film could feel like a cheated ticket to some filmgoers after reading some reviews for this film i was expecting to find myself chuckling out loud at the antics of kevin kline and his spin on the world of investigation i was wrong there was no humor in this film at all even when o'conner tried to bring some in it seemed forced and unhealthy i must repeat this is not a comedy it even is n't really that suspenseful nor is the thrilling aspect actually that thrilling i must admit that whomever sold this film to a company under the guise that it was a comedy should be awarded the best salesman of the decade '' award somebody believed this film was funny and even pasted a preview to it with the word comedy '' written all over it someone sold the company a broken product hook line and sinker i just ask you to beware overall this film was horrible from the poor acting the cryptic story that needed some form of decoder ring to understand the passionless actors to the harshly branded word comedy '' january man proves that not all films should be made and that an advanced screen process should be used regularly i genuinely encourage you to skip this film no good will come of you watching this mess i promise grade out of
january man is a film is a must see if you need to to update your film evaluation measurement scale it is the absolute worst you can then use it as a benchmark to reconsider other bad movies you may have seen as i assume many others i was attracted to the purchase based on the superstar cast if one were to read the fine print however you could get a hint that something is wrong when you see that the film lasts 1 hours only unfortunately i did not read the fine print this film is so absurd and bad that you truely need to wonder about the people who have posted the other reviews probably friends and family of the filmamaker
four brothers '' is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood '' has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys ' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers '' is filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more
almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders but the movie 's not a total wash after all it 's got a great soundtrack
i got this film because i 'm from detroit where this takes place it 's a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe
this movie was way too fictional stephen king needs to stop writing
whether lounging in a field of mustard flowers waxing drunk in an affected traveler 's accent '' on the ahem realness of reality or mumbling about chartres cathedral and the fallibility of man who must in the end die '' orson welles slurs his way through this pathetic attempt to embody his grand old boy '' superego like that drunken brother in law tolerated but only for your sister 's sake every five minutes i expected apneatic snoring to interrupt his incessant rambling narration i can only conclude that these disturbances were removed in too bad like drunk uncle zane passing out in the middle of explaining the whole damn conspiracy these somnolent interruptions would have provided a blessed intermission during which to run to the other side of the house and hope to god he sleeps it off
the only extraordinary thing about this film is how ow could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it i found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through after i dozed off do n't be fooled by the other review here they are the true fakes if you know what i mean save your money and save your time
orson welles was a master of film but not this film while i appreciate the message he is trying to convey his cleverness '' is off the deep end this film is like a big for welles he 's so proud of how clever he is but the film is a mess like paranoid disjointed ramblings in his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style clever is most clever when it is not obvious in this film he beats you over the head with the subtext '' and thinks he 's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a the story line i 'm sorry i wasted my time to watch it i would have turned it off but given my high respect for welles i continued expecting a revelation or twist alas no it was just a stupid movie
this is a dumb boring movie i actually think this movie would be better to watch in than the in this movie sucks badly and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting direction characters and storyline one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for scenes that simply do not deliver if you are looking for good please do not buy this these reviewers '' who review this movie either have an affiliation with the studio that released it or simply have not really experienced any good movies and are just reviewing out of ignorance the field sequential in this movie is horrible due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field ! ! i dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential if there is no depth to the picture then there is no real ! if you are looking for beyond excellent then get yourself a copy of alien adventure '' encounter in the third dimension '' or the haunted castle '' i have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile i love horror i love and i love cult and b movies but this movie just could not hold my interest for long i have stopped and started it 3 times since i have received it and have yet to finish the end of the movie again in but stay away from the lousy version it downright sucks
aside from the fact that one of the discs was cracked when i got this set which amazon promptly replaced with no hassle this is a chronicle of an ambitious effort by rock and rollers who seemed to care and others who wanted to ride the coattails of those people if you are looking for all the artists that played and all the songs from live aid this is not the set for you in fact there 's been some audio recreation on this set which i do n't think is even mentioned in the collection i felt gyped but you can read about it in wikipedia 's listing for live aid good performances by bowie and queen as is expected but some of the other 80 's acts are horrid ! i was at live aid and had no sentimentality for this package the good thing is that this set promises to give some of the money to the band aid effort though where that money will eventually end up is as mysterious as where led zeppelin 's fottage wound up
i recorded the live aid concert on vhs i mean i was up at six am to catch it when it started in australia inxs was the bomb i would have bought this disc if they included oz for africa ' on it too that was during the listen like thieves '' era actually before the cd was released not to mention a plethra of incredible talent all of which i 'd love to have on then to know that 85 other songs are missing from the dvd of which i 'm pretty sure i have on vhs still it just kills me that someone sat down decided what the masses '' would have liked to see i 'd be happier if someone just came out said that they could n't get the copyrights to the stuff ok i 'm done with my ranting thanks for the heads up i wo n't be buying this until they include everything damn it
following live 8 i have to wonder if live aid justifies the euphoria that followed it most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its that 's debatable what it did manage to do was make bob geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name knighted by the monarchy and very very rich the same with pushed them into the statosphere and made bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet same with queen pushed them into so do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time sounds pretty good to me one ca n't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money ' there was a shot deleted of course where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving another example of there hyprocrisy madonna singing 'imagine ' on her latest tour right ! i ca n't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that mccartneys version of 'let it be ' was stomach churning face it the only musician peter green mac who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified proves a point
if you are looking for a dvd that is filled with white stripes music and interviews look elsewhere the item description says it has over 40 minutes of interviews but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes if that of this is actually with the band and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd it has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the white stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning it is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details but it is not something i will watch again if jack meg were telling their own story that would be worth it
the video certainly has potential however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is waay too easy i barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts and they are entirely too short perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout but i have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment notably the firm abs and tamilee webb ab tapes if you are an advanced exerciser i say pass on this one
after viewing the 7 faces of lao i must agree with the march 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid b '' film when i was growing up i spent many hours in movie theaters watching fantasy and films george pal movies were always among my favorites and still are to make statements that the 7 faces of lao was george pal 's greatest film is unfounded have these people ever watched the time machine or war of the worlds if we are talking about great fantasy or movies which george pal should be remembered for then you do n't get much better than these two the only credit to this film is the scene where lao shows the town 's people the movie clips of the roman city being destroyed by a vocanic eruption the eruption scenes are taken from another george pal classic fantasty film atlantis the lost continent now there is a great film to entertain the children the only problem with atlantis the lost continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on dvd for those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market
i purchase a lot of educational videos on photography and photoshop but this one was not at all what i expected it has little if any educational value instead the video shows photos taken by french photographers with commentary in french do n't buy this as an educational video
capote '' directed by bennett miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. it is based on gerald clarke 's 1988 book capote a biography '' the film starts by capote 's philip seymour hoffman interest in the kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime his knowledge of the criminals especially perry smith clifton collins which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship the writer is sympathetic and sees in smith a strong resemblance with himself yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it in cold blood '' was his most famous novel the one that established him as a legendary writer he was left overwhelmed confused and unsatisfied however the movie is quite ambiguous though characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive at many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations for instance people are always laughing heartily at what capote has to say although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter the setting and the music were both barely significant although philip seymour hoffman 's performance is highly remarkable the actor 's resemblance of capote is questionable hoffman is '' and more stout than the slender barely '' truman capote
this movie is utterly unremarkable actually scratch that this movie is actually very remarkable because of how bad it is first of all the protagonist is pathetic it 's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems all she does is cry and moan second the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i 've seen in any movie third there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered which disrupt the movie 's flow and continuity for example the protagonist gets hit by an truck and her car is absolutely mangled but she walks away without a scratch someone care to explain how that 's possible i probably would have stopped watching this excuse for a movie if i was n't at a friend 's house and there 's the fact that it 's his movie i sat through it just to be polite when all is said and done this movie just is n't worth your time i 'm glad i 'm not the one who actually paid my dollars to buy this piece of dung
i 've been had is all i can say after reading other reviews i really thought this would be an interesting exciting movie instead the story is lame the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so not scary or at least gripping i watched the whole thing as i thought maybe i am missing something but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end sorry guys but this is nowhere near audition tale of two sisters or even whispering corridors
well i was once again duped by customers rating a product to high there is no possible way this was a 5 star movie the plot is just not believable especially near the end parts of it are quite suspenseful and the sound is very good i just had a hard time buying into the story spoiler this movie is taken from the urban legend of waking up in a tub filled with ice and a note telling you to call the police or hospital or you will die because your kidney has been removed for sale on the black market well throw in a girl with a bad kidney her frustrated lover a girl trying to raise money for her sick mother these 3 characters create a twisted love triangle and some guy who sets up the victims for the girl trying to raise the money for her mom girl a meets frustrated guy guy a they have sex girl a meets frustrated guy 's girl friend girl b girl a and girl b become best of friends after girl b finds out girl a had sex with her man guy a girl a 's business parter guy b try 's to get girl b 's kidney but finds out it is bad girl b try 's to buy kidney on black market with girl a 's help and police show up and kill guy girl a finds out girl b tipped off the police and so she attacks guy a because he only uses her for sex and she then removes girl b 's bad kidney and then removes her own kidney and puts it in the tub of ice with girl b as a gift girl a calls the police then dies the police arrive and place girl a 's kidney in girl girl b finds out she is ok because they put back her kidney but it is not her kidney it is her friends girl a so she wants it removed because they are not friends anymore
this movie is basically about 12 old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 old worries about getting out of this small '' i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie
if you 've seen tortilla soup there is no need to watch this movie this is just the chinese version of the said movie the similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both same characters same plot only in a different setting i got to enjoy the scenes with food though
this movie is typical hollywood trash the show biz '' liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers '' a much better and far more honest film
the original '' versions are letterboxed for anyone with an hdtv or widescreen regular tv these dvds are a major disappointment the original versions are matted from their original aspect ration for tvs so they look like crud on an hdtv or other widescreen tv they appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs the other versions from 2004 appear to be identical to the dvds previously released
nominally a story of a young man who by sheer luck is drawn into a life of wealth and love between two women one becomes his wife from whose family affords him a wealthy lifestyle and a lucrative career he 's love for her is real and it is a comforting eros that has all the marks being built for a lifetime his mistress however is only of modest means but in contrast to his wife is mercurial exciting and erotic naturally it is the mistress that becomes pregnant as his mistress puts pressure on him to leave his wealth and wife for her he struggles with how to live with the best of both worlds under the threat that the mistress will inform the wife the young man hatches a murder plot which succeeds only by a single happenstance of fortune this could have been an excellent and well told story but its unusual plot is completely ruined by a plodding graduate school concern to show literary sophistication in other words it is quite dull a complete waste of the talents of the actors this film has all the things we have come to love and hate coming from woody allen the main character is a pipe for allen 's own belief in universe without justice and purpose it is not exactly a warming point of view but it does provide the mainspring for the story 's novel resolution at the same time the film is at pains to show the cosmopolitanism refined taste and the odd belief that ordinary human concerns and pursuits are raised to olympian rarified heights by eccentricity allen projects on his characters this is all too precious to add to the lack of verisimilitude the mistress is an unemployed actress of a modest background who is forced to take a low paying job in london yet she seems to have lots of spare time spends loads of money and lives in an apartment we should all be so lucky to get much the same as her wealthy counterparts in the end our murderer is confronted by the ghosts of his victims it is here that the story 's message '' comes through it is tempting to construe the murderer 's calm rebuff to these specters as a mere rationalization instead it is allen 's resolution of the old theological problem the presence of evil in a universe under the control of a good god to wit there is no god no purpose no justice evil exists but it simply is '' as all other things in life are '' i doubt if allen thinks he came across this viewpoint all by himself a man as well read as allen surely knows this variety of nihilism can be found in the ancient greeks be that as it may it is hardly a thought underrepresented in modern culture this is where i fault allen the most most of nihilism 's acolytes have the good sense to make their hobbyhorse entertaining and fun there are musicians who believe their tune making is more artistic and musical '' if they avoid all the attractive hooks '' perhaps allen believes his mirthless narrative is a mark of thoughtful seriousness all i know is matchpoint deserved the quick death it received in the movie theaters
this film was ruined once it became a thriller '' due to two reasons 1. shotguns make a very very loud noise 2. the actions and inactions of the police were totally unbelievable if you can overlook these major plot holes you might enjoy this we did n't
match point may offer a change of locale and style for woody allen but it does nothing to redress the continuing decline of his work it 's not bad more flat partially because of some awkward dialogue allen really does n't have an ear for the british dialects going either for dick van dyke or medieval and some uninspiring lead performances social climbing tennis pro jonathan rhys myers the poor man 's jude law says all his lines correctly and with almost perfect diction without ever convincing there 's anything but an actor who 'll never fulfil his early promise underneath but it 's scarlet johannson who is the film 's most surprising casualty as a struggling actress faced with such awkwardly on the nose dialogue and such a stock character she visibly flounders for much of the first half of the film as if cast adrift by a director afraid of interfering with the actors by ever directing them no matter how apparent it is that they need help supporting players are mostly left to do their best with parts to varying degrees of success matthew goode ewan bremner alexander armstrong laziness brian cox paul kaye and embarrassment james nesbitt and a startlingly inept colin salmon the second half does improve though there 's the definite feeling that allen is dodging the issue in the potentially promising but unintentionally laughable closing scenes and some of the dialogue is painfully amateur with its shades of a kiss before dying via the martin landau plot strand of crimes and misdemeanors but without the interesting bits this never really feels quite like a proper movie a bit of a plodder
this movie is no heathers '' it 's not even mean girls '' as hard as it tried to be witty shocking dark and satirical it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i 'm just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless '' and the craft '' until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push i just did n't get it the movie was n't funny which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses carol kane could n't even elicit a smile out of me the plot was full of holes and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers but i was at least hoping for 1 hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately the entertainment '' piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless
boy this movie was weird and psycho i happen to like the weird movies but it was way off the psycho side for me friends try to cover up an accidental death '' from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong things like this i try to stay away from although i am glad i saw it so i wo n't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not now i know i gave it 2 stars because the movie did have it 's charms
my wife and i ejected this dvd after half way through and planned to throw it out i later figured i 'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it the last guy is good and i wo n't throw this away now he does a bit on throwing up that is good most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny
how can anyone stand this drivel worst movie i ever watched repeatedly worse than watching walk tall '' 8 times in a row worse even than watching the home shopping network eww eww
four brothers '' is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood '' has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys ' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers '' is filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more
almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders but the movie 's not a total wash after all it 's got a great soundtrack
i got this film because i 'm from detroit where this takes place it 's a pretty typical revenge flick four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer usual smartass remarks guys talking bs fights shootouts blah blah blah i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch this script was mediocre at best give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe
there are 2 types of people who like black and white films old people and clever clogs why watch this when you can buy picture perfect with the lovely jennifer aniston for the same price the emperor 's new clothes
this is one of so many movies that is foolishly and blindly overrated citizen kane is also on that list it has some drama to it but the lack of realism turns it into a silly movie in the big finish the great triumph of the church and the little man brando simply gets up from a beating and walks on his own two feet to report to work what idiocy what can that solve absolutely nothing and yet the premise of the movie is that by walking to work brando is taking the corrupt union leadership down some idiot in the background makes it clear just in case we did n't get the point by saying now we can run the union on the up and up '' haha what a joke brando 's little walk at the end is purely symbolic and will do not a damn thing to change the union leadership it 's just a hollywood happy ending a triumph of good over evil of over murder sure actually a triumph of hollywood silliness over honest standards of truth and sense in movies as pure entertainment it falls short too there is just too much depression and futility it 's not worth the agita and it is all wrapped up so nicely at the end is n't it if you have any sense at all you realize that the mob will kill brando soon enough so what difference does it make that he is allowed to work one day none at all he 's dead meat what kind of happy garbage are we being fed
sorry but elizabeth 's character in pride and prejudice was meant to be plain and her sister was the beautiful one that was a recurring point in the story then why the heck did they cast ashwarya rai most beautiful woman in the world '' as the plain sister give me a break ! wickham give me another break ! in the original he is a charming poor guy who sweeps vulnerable and strong women alike off their feet into doomdom in this version i could not see for the life of me why anybody would want to spend a minute alone with this fellow let alone the rest of their life his charm if anything was unconvincing the storyline was cute but the actors did not have enough screen presence to carry this time old tale
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out
i made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to i do n't consider myself overprotective but these stories have a kid abusing a dog pluto a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone 's knee including showing the kid 's bottom from above and donald chasing chip dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things i turned it off after that talked to several other friends to see if i was overreacting they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they do n't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon was a little surprised this made it out of disney especially in today 's day time be okay for older kids but i do n't really want to explain guns or why it 's not to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old
well it looks like my question regarding why these two classic cartoon favorites '' dvd 's are being released in september has been answered ! anywhey being honest i do own one dvd of this series and that is called starring chip n dale '' that is because there has never been a chip and dale collection on dvd before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons
one of the labels for this anchorman dvd labels the edition as uncalled for '' and i could n't agree this movie was completely uncalled for and unnecessary in an edition of gameinformer magazine reiner and joe recalled a conversation they had in which it took them several hours to regain normal brain functions '' after an unfortunate at the movie theaters between them and uwe boll 's bloodrayne i hate to say it but i feel the same way about this movie this movie literally made me feel but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour the part i did see however made me think of movies in which will ferrell was actually movies like elf my personal favorite from ferrell or more recently talladega nights the story of ricky bobby anchorman really was n't that interesting i laughed at maybe one joke in the movie and overall i hated the experience good thing i watched it at a friend 's house and not at the otherwise i 'd have to demand my money back
my brother quoted a line out of anchorman that immediately caused my wife to put it at the top of our netflix list we could n't pass up the opportunity to see steve carrell screw up the news like he did in bruce almighty anchorman has a plot but does anyone care it 's mostly about ron burgundy will ferrell playing a overconfident anchorman whose macho consisting of brian fantana paul rudd brick tamland steve carrell and champ kind david koechner is disrupted by the promotion of veronica corningstone christina applegate into their news ranks mostly anchorman is all over the place it pokes fun at news shows like how they all hate each other like gangs and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys it jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman brick has an iq of 48 and is what some people call mentally retarded '' it mocks fashion look at those shoes ! that moustache ! those slacks ! it painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace sometimes it 's about the love between a man and a woman and sometimes it 's about the love between a man and his dog anchorman 's a lot of things not all of them funny in fact carrell is far funnier than ferrell and he has a lot less lines ferrell infuses burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of he says all his lines like a kid in front of his high school class being funny takes a lot of work but it should n't look like it ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie that leaves poor applegate to shoulder the burden bless her heart but she 's the straightwoman so there 's not a lot she can do to help it 's hard to say a comedy is bad just about every movie can be funny even unintentionally and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective i have to be honest though anchorman feels lazy it does n't really have a plot the acting is terrible and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal bloody deaths i mean jazz flute is funny and all but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something the ending does n't even make any sense and it 's clear after watching what was cut that they cut a major plot point i love carrell though his lines alone make the film worth watching and now that i 've seen it '' i love lamp ''
this movie is typical hollywood trash the show biz '' liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers '' a much better and far more honest film
i anticipate this review will not garner too many helpful '' votes since a majority of people appear to have enjoyed this movie but it is something i need to say anyway i am writing this review because i 've read quite a few reviews written by men and women alike stating that men will hate this film whereas women will love it '' i am a woman and i absolutely hated this movie the only reason being that it was absolutely boring and for lack of a better word stupid i ca n't tell you why it was so painfully boring but i 'm guessing it had something to do with the plot which is to begin with it is rare that i give out the rating but this is one of those movies it actually pained me to sit through i watched it at a family member 's house and i fell asleep 3 times note that i am an insomniac and i do not fall asleep easily i ca n't help but resent it a little when people say that women will love this movie '' because it was quite honestly one of the most boring movies i as a perfectly legitimate woman have ever seen to add insult to injury the are terribly annoying a couple of reviewers have said that to call this a 'chick flick ' is insulting to all chicks '' and i vehemently agree i understand that some women probably will like it my point is only that not all of us will enjoy this dull insipid movie just because we 're chicks
at the end of the documentary someone says that critics did n't like the movie because they did not understand that lynch was trying to be expressionist they did not understand the juxtaposition of horror and beauty '' needless to say if you do n't like something you just do n't like it i do n't care if it is picasso miro pollock or your mama art is just like that you like it or not if we are to be so snob to just say yes ! what a wonderful piece of art that is pollock 's masterpiece this goes beyond anything done before '' well just fine you are just being snob but the good thing about art is that we can disagree and that it is subjective never objective i just watched this movie today and i did not like it period i never watched the tv show and i never will and i do not care about lynch being a talented and special gifted film director i just do n't buy it and i do not like him i saw wild at heart and blue velvet long time ago andi remember them as a little bit better not too much but this is not the kind of movies i like do not misunderstand me the actors are good the filming is technically good the plot is not bad at all but it 's just the whole think put together that does not apeal me i would give this movie a 2 stars and a half or 5 over 0. i bought it because it is in the 100 best movies in dvd by peter travers and i am starting being very disapointed by that book because i am far from travers ' tastes
i expect to get many not helpful votes as always happens when you dis a movie or book which has many fans so be it if you are a hard core lynch fan you may enjoy this but i found it was very dated the film is very slow it is very hard to understand both in terms of what is going on and in terms of simply hearing what people say sadly it has no subtitles whatever it is thriving on copious amounts of weirdness in all kinds of ways and ultimately i found it tedious i am sorry i really wanted to like it
rent it but by all means do n't buy it you wo n't watch it more than once this movie is not for those who have invested hours into the tv show although you will better understand what 's going on if you have seen the show none of this will really seem new or interesting to you you learn some new facts about bob and the man from another place but nothing important for the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show adding only pointless and unrealistic new occurances bobby kills someone donna is replaced by an new actor coop forsees all the future comings of laura 's murder etc all of the twin peaks charm that you have come to love is gone and the movie really suffers from that you ca n't only give coop 10 meaningless lines and expect the show to succeed i think lynch 's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series focusing on the complications of coop being in the black lodge harry having an emotional attachment to coop but being forced to bring him down etc i guess if you have never seen the series this may be more interesting but i dont really think so overall the look and the feel was very foreign and uncomfortable and it moved very slow it is somewhat of a letdown coming from a monster like lynch i 'm glad i 've seen it but hell i 'd rather watch dune again before this
this is the classic submarine war movie and most submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie i greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action based on what i read about submarines the special effects are a bit cheesy you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships but if you overlook those items you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of action
i hated this movie it is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does stupid plot too many holes and stupid ending
i saw this movie 'cause i love horror and i love halle but this movie just sucked
ali g meet stuart smalley the ladies man pat and the butabi brothers you are now in the distinguished company of your snl cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests yes da ali g show is hilarious due mostly to its main character ali his interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment you would therefore think that an ali g who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted and you would be incorrect sir ! the movie is a 90 minute mess the plot '' is mentioned elsewhere on this page so no need for me to ridicule it but suffice it to say that the ali g character here is a grating bore lacking in wit or charisma if you like ali g you will not like this
i like ali g but this is so retarded that it is a waste of time it makes half baked seem sophisticated i laughed a few times however
i suppose if you never read the book you might think this movie is good maybe even charming but having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel i was so grossly disappointed i ca n't tell you see the book is about two people novalee and willie jack they head west together until willie jack abandons her at a walmart they part ways on more than one level his life goes as low as a life can and her life rises beautifully it 's a study in contrasts and it 's done impeccably in the novel with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey but it did n't translate because of hollywood 's mentality hollywood cut benny goodluck a main character in the novel completely out and shaved moses another major character down to a bit part while making novalee 's a major player and they destroyed forney who is supposed to be eccentric genius withdrawn and strange they turned him into a stud type with a crooked smile so not forney i never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life that horrid and lexie she 's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and tendencies and they put ashley judd in the role hello ! ! does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you that 's just the biggie complaints too read the book do n't watch the movie you 'll be amazed at how inept hollywood was at telling this story
i loved my life '' and was expecting something good here based on all these reviews but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these dvds were a bad omen still i hung in and hoped for the best i was sitting there watching and really wondering do people really relate to this stuff '' the characters on this show look like they 're from jc penney catalogs or ivory soap commercials white bread sanitary vapid thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him the kids on this show are cute but all kids are cute nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing i am sooooo glad that the world is nothing like how it 's portrayed on this show never again ! !
if this were an animated film this would be passable entertainment but it is not it is real and what are you watching is wholesale animal abuse see in real life staged films usually require multiple takes to get the shot right '' perhaps the angles are n't good enough to use whatever all throughout i kept wondering what horrors the crew was doing behind the camera to get the animals to do what they wanted if you were utterly naive about the ways of the world and viewed this picture with innocent eyes you might find it cute after all you have dainty music deceptive editing and the charming narration of dudley moore that is the magic of i 'm no animal rights fascist but this is beyond the pale misery is so clear and evident upon the faces of the dog and cat this is a ghastly production
get together with some friends and as many bottles of wine that way you can possibly have some enjoyment with this inexplicable and boring movie for expressionless characters for interminable shots
this movie is basically about 12 old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 old worries about getting out of this small '' i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie
even if you are not a big fan you will still enjoy dark complete first season besides having an impressive plot concept the first season of the show gave us a look at some interesting personal interaction between believable characters i liked the second season for the way it developed the story line but the first season was better done over all whether or not you like science fiction you will get hours of enjoyment out of this box set of the first season of dark angel
i got this because everyone seems to like it maybe if i can get through the first disk it will get better i dunno i find it disturbing how meny guys in this show want to do the humpty hump with this little girl jessica alba is like 16 or something and these 30 to 40 year old guys are all over her like a cheap coat not likeing it oh and she brags all the time like a little kid not liking it
i have been doing yoga for several yrs power yoga was a disappointment to me too much repetition of forward bending poses and seems like he has reduced yoga to a aerobic weight loss work out do n't waste your money
dont get me wrong i 'm kinda young but i love 80 's 90 's movies specially the horror ones i had great spectation for early geoge romero movies but both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad gorge romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry but for today standars they are not even they are not that good for most of the 80 's 90 's movies the bad 1. acting is not beleavible it looks like the were acting '' 2. the dialog 's are not how people actually talk 3. the soldiers at day of the dead '' are a shame they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline they behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups 4. more than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other 5. i think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans listening music shooting talking '' 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment theres is not any frightening atmosfere the good 1. the gore scenes are really good maybe too much bloody it shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated so far the only great zombie movie i have seen beleive it or not is resident evil 1. resident evil 1 has it all resident evil 2 not resident evil 2 is one those just shoot and kick '' movies and i 'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo so if you want a gory movie maybe you may like this movie but the gore is just at the end of the movie you will be better pleased with cabin fever '' if you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe resident evil 1 poltergeist the original japanese version of the ring and the grouch scarecrows alien aliens and even alien 3 not alien 4 it sucks but the best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price
this is one of those movies that you have to ask '' why remake a movie that did it right the first time ! ! ! buy the 1968 version and forget this one ! skip it !
it tells me 'no device to download to ' amazon debug your product before you take people 's money ! ! you are acting like microsoft there is no way to report this to amazon does anybody there care anymore
mos def i think his name is had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie i wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already if people were trying to kill me i would n't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on people are coming to kill me why do n't i talk really loud so they can find me was he mentally challenged or what i was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of SMILE enjoy talking like eddie mos def for hours after you 've seen it to amuse your friends
this is by far the worst moive i 've seen i love the first secret garden no one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl it 's a classic but this sequel is terriable it controdicts the first moive it takes the magic away if you liked the origanl first moive do n't watch this it will take the magic out of the first moive
the slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy unintelligible at time what the books are about
unfortunately we have yet to see this movie because amazon never sent our dvds i ordered this and two other videos for my son on january scheduled for delivery between today more than two weeks later i received another email from amazon notifying us that there were delays with some of my items '' and estimating a february delivery date 5 weeks after my initial order ! had them shipped the next day and 10 savings on my dvds plus free shipping
although i luv the dolls this was such a bad dvd that i regretted to have purchased it
if your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of end of the century '' or filth and the fury '' this ai n't it ! picture taking 40 hours of bad home video really awful sound and editing together and calling it a documentary no current interviews no voice over making any sense of the chaos no thought to flow or storyline just a mishmash of stuff banged together a real dissapointment the saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance i 've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due its a shame this is what its been reduced to shame on everyone involved
i 'm having a hard time watching this first no communicable disease is 100 or even 99.99 fatal so there should be lots of unaffected adults still around from before anyway people complain yeah man nobody 's got electricity '' did the wiring disappear the sockets the the transformers are n't there still big turbines at major dams so what 's the problem the problem is knowledge how to run and repair all those things how do you learn 99 from books manuals etc did those all disappear no the young doctor '' he a learned all that by watching his father ! come on ! what do students in medical school do about 95 of their time they study books are the medical books still around of course though there was barely if any mention of them during this story at one point they were thumbing through books like monkeys just looking for some inside some volume in short the whole problem with this new society is lack of knowledge and lack of organisation but because there are still millions and millions of books around that means there are uncountable resources available for the ambitious to make use of in order to better their lives maybe nobody is ambitious duh
i picked this set up despite reservations reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show because of the creator michael straczynski unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff it 's really nothing more then a c average show normally that 's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel showtime and costs over 70.00 on dvd it 's just not good enough specific problems i had with the show include a lot of filler episodes the season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line the show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story this is the model that hbo uses production value is also sorely lacking once again i 'm going to compare to hbo i feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks the hbo series carnivale has unbelievable production value the set 's locations costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality the same can be said for deadwood and rome but carnival makes for a better comparison but jeremiah all looks the same you can tell the show was all shot in the same location every back road and town look like they are in the same county the biggest problem however is just the premise a post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get 's tired fast i had to force myself through the last 9 episodes luke perry 's quest to find valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery simon 's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled so basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that jason presley makes a guest appearance just what this show needed a 90210 reunion if you 're looking for a great show this is not it if you can watch it cheap give a whirl but do n't waste any hard earned cash on this one
well i guess i 'm the odd one out as i really really dislike this dvd i love aerobics in my search to find an aerobics dvd i bought moving through menopause '' based on the other reviews on this site my complaints settle around the aerobics part of this dvd but that is what i bought it for the workout starts at a ridiculously fast speed with no actual warm up the choreography is horrible ! it manages to be boring while at the same time having you jump around like a jackrabbit on crack several times through the work out when it 's mentioned that a lower level of activity can be followed the shot pans the woman doing the highest level the rhythm and enjoyment of motivating yet fluid moves which i look to aerobics for is fairly absent in this workout the focus on balance during the cool down is interesting and of worth but that 's the only thing i have to praise about the aerobics section of this dvd the presentation is flat a workout dvd may not need to be a fashion show but there should be some spark after all if it 's any good the consumer will be doing it hundreds of times during their ownership of it nothing in this presentation had that kind of spark the most menopausal thing in this dvd is the women 's attire which may be a small thing but combined with the rest is worth mentioning i gave this dvd a solid try i 've done the aerobics workout several times in the last 6 months and just keep deepening my dislike for it
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke stepped on we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star '' seems like a generous rating

the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd the fifth disk with an extra from the and a documentary about child stars this set was poorly put together the shorts included are quite random and buying this set would be a waste of money each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters first there is alfalfa then buckwheat spanky darla porky mickey stymie then oh wait no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name then farina and last phil who you may be asking phil macmahon the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938. still do n't know him maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot it is one of my favorite shorts from the series however it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races the films themselves are very good disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents it is a total disaster just like in reunion in rhythm one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry the film has been seriously cut there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores but it works there are sound effects too sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train it is a very cute film farina is especially funny in it the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship when it sinks they find a real one to destroy this short has also been cut there is no opener for it either it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it disk three opens with mary queen of tots it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang she dreams they come to life and when she wakes up she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters the print on this one is not bad at all the last film is school 's out a talkie featuring a different cast it is a film featuring miss crabtree the new teacher the picture is good it seems to be the one from cabin fever disk four begins with bear shooters this is a less than great film the print is great it is the one from cabin fever our gang follies of 1938 is a great film very funny long and exciting it features the later talkie cast waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years a lesser film that seems forced it was also released in a 5 part rascals set disk five is the extra features dvd it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show on it some of the silent gang are reunited joe cobb jackie condon farina hoskins johnny downs and mickey daniels are featured the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview other child stars like jackie coogan judy garland shirley temple roddy mcdowall and ron howard are focused on as well the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain many of them have been available cheaply for years the only reason a fan might want to see this collection the same reason i bothered was to see the rarer silent films however the rest of the set is trash
i agree with most of the reviews here i also grew up with watching the on sunday mornings as a kid and so when we introduced a vhs rented tape to my daughters they loved them the talkies '' are the only films i 'd consider buying and i think most people would only want as well there was 1 dvd missing we had two 5 dvd 's and missing the spanky gang 4 disk right now we only have 1 original talkie '' and the rest documentaries and silent movies i believe the company who produces this dvd set should be ashamed of themselves they plaster spanky 's images all over all the videos and then we do n't even have one of him ! ! ! ! ! ! do not buy this video unless you like silent movies and bad documentaries with film qualities that were bad copies that are hard on the eyes ! ! ! ! we 're taking this one back and damanding a refund ! !
i am a little rascals fan i watched them all the time when i was growing up they do n't televise the any more and i wanted to introduce my children to some of the wonderful and funny shows i watched as a kid i was so excited when i saw this dvd collection but was very disappointed after viewing it i found the description of contents given on the box to be somewhat misleading the movies on disc 1 and 2 are silent movies with characters i 've never seen disc 3 has two silent movies and one that actually had sound with some of the characters i was used to seeing disc 4 had sound contained more of the characters i grew up viewing and was actually pretty good disc 5 was more about a reunion with the characters along with information on other child stars from back in the day if a slightly broader description would have been given stating that the majority of the movies were silent films and that only approximatly 4 of the movies not discs had the actors alfalfa darla and spanky in it i would not have purchased them during the time i was a child and watched the little rascals it always had sound i never knew that some of their films were silent it would have made a big difference in my selecting this paticular collection it would have been nice to have this information disclosed in the description on the packaging
like the reviewer before me i too was very disappointed in this dvd the clips that have sound are terrible most of the clips were from the silent film era and the players were unfamiliar to me there was one clip with alfalfa and spanky that was fun to watch but the majority of these clips was awful no effort was put into digitally and transfering the picture and sound i could have done just as good of a job transfering these clips using just a vcr and a dvr do n't waste your money on buying this disc it is a shame because with a little effort these clips could of had much better quality and it would have been more fun to watch these vintage clips
this movie was so bad i fell asleep watching it in the theatre i normally like buddy films but this one was just plain bad the jokes were horrible the acting was worse reality tv fits into this movie seamlessly which is probably another reason why i did n't enjoy it i think reality '' programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business to sum it all up save your money i 'm sure you can find a better way to spend it
the church '' is nonsensical rubbish i know dario argento is weak on plot but this movie is absurd it 's interesting how argento does such a good job with a movie like suspiria '' creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky but with the church '' the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is the result is a disaster ! ! indeed there is zero character development horrendous acting monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called the church '' this movie is trash period ! stay away ! ! ! !
i did n't even want to see this movie but my brother read the book and wanted to see it we were unaware of the fact that this was n't meant to follow the book everything was poorly done in this movie even hans zimmer 's score did n't save it i 've mentioned that i 'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars and if i could i 'd give it negative ten

gina is just like the protesters she just does n't get it ! '' the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it ! whereas africa 's problems including poverty aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down ! as long as more babies are born than people dying their population goes up very bad the only way to eliminate poverty is less children ! ! send money for that but nothing else
the concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded the girl in the cafe '' turned out to be a political message i wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character gina '' gina browbeats the members of the conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows does the thought ever cross her mind or the person writing the script that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of all varieties of venereal disease children born out of wedlock etc maybe gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly this movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an r rating for nudity and language
the girl in a cafe '' is a romantic story pretending to bring along a political message in the form of an ignoramus main character gina who is supposed to be the symbol of 'humanity ' the movie starts off with an unlikely match of a british beurocrat fighting for the millenium goals to abolish world poverty starting with the summit with a supposedly charming girl he meets in a cafe gina when she accompanies him to rekjavik for the summit and as she learns more about his goals she becomes decidedly rude by attacking her beau 's boss for not pushing for these goals hard enough not to mention this bossman seems to be the only sensible character in the film actually to make a change and not just having expensive breakfasts dinners and ranting to other people about not doing anything to make the world a better place gina and if this gina character was supposed to represent humanity then i 'm afraid the writer has an oversimplified view of humanity itself i do n't think any average person on the street in any rich country would n't be heartbroken or at least quite bothered when hears about how many poor children die everyday etc but still nothing changes why not because those men in the room ' in the summit do n't care but because they represent the very nature of humanity of the masses they are ruling like gina everyone gets engrossed in their own lives and luxuries but unlike gina most of us would atleast appreciate the people who are spending their lives trying to make a change the bosses of the 'millenium project ' that she attacks rather than being blind to our own humanity while living off of luxury but maintaining this 'holier than thou ' attitude
the girl in the cafe starts out with promise the promise being to be a sweet love story bill nighy is lawrence an aging bachelor working for the government as a financial expert who meets a lovely young girl kelly macdonald in a cafe during coffee break nighy does a nice acting turn as the twitchy shy older man and macdonald as does a fine job as the adorable if undistinguished girl in the cafe it 's an unlikely but possible match that progresses when lawrence asks gina to go to a international conference with him in iceland it is at that point that the girl in the cafe stops being a romance and starts becomming a political movie gina suddenly loses her sweetness and becomes rude pushing her leftist political agenda which by the way hardly anyone in the movie disagrees with they are just not going far enough for the politically correct gina gina 's political outbursts are an amazing show of disrespect for lawrence who invited her on the iceland junket in the first place as it puts him at odds with his boss the target of gina 's political salvos it was at this point having been disappointed in not getting a sweet romance and instead a vehicle for leftist political views i decided it was n't worth it and turned the dvd off the victim of a bait and switch if you are a lefty the girl in the cafe 's rants will be music to your ears if so hang in there the second half of the movie may be worth it to you
this should be called the john ford tiny collection '' as most of his major films are not included even john ford the early years '' would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of ford 's work shame on amazon for their collaboration in this matter and for advertising the john ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other
for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this 0 stars the infamous fake o '' scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable one of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with just fyi
trinity collection is a bootleg picture is extremly poor 3 movies for 10 too bad i like trinity she 's cute ooops wrong
boot hill has nothing to do with the other two trinity '' movies really boot hill is the last in a trilogy of colizzi films starting with god forgives i do n't '' and ace high '' the correct '' trinity series would be more or less they call me trinity and trinity rides again there is no such thing as a part three to that the best boot hill dvd on the american market is that of wild east but it 's not a totally uncut version
i remember these movies as being funny but the quality of the transfer and the aspect ratio of the dvd 's in this set is pretty awful hard to watch and enjoy the occasional bits of humor too bad
buyer beware the boothill dvd in this collection was cracked ! so i guess we 'll go with the product quality stinks
really save your money and buy the full season sets why would they put these out after they have the full seasons out there to buy
more re only cool thing about this is the cover
a juvenile attempt this is a very pathetic film about shallow and empty people every conversation is fake and pseudo poignant the dilemmas '' are trivial and pithy the fact that such talented people starred in this piece of poop is
this film is definitely not a masterpiece i found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly yes the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak to make matters worse the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere perhaps i missed something gigantic because i was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but i would not attempt to see it again however there were a couple of memorable scenes i would strongly advise renting it before purchase some people do love the film but i do n't understand why
this movie is one long journey to absolute nothingness sometimes my favorite parts in movies are the quiet one 's movies with great moments of silence are great if they 're necessary unfourtunately while i appreciated the quiet introspection i could not tolerate a whole movie like that i will say morvern callar has a great opening one that makes you wonder the rest though is just boring i appreciated nothing else and found it empty nothing was gained or lost or cant recommend this to any one unless you have to see every movie ever made
morvern callar '' was a film destined to cause some trouble for a number of reasons of them a movie adaptation that plays loose and fast and false with the book is often going to cause trouble whereas many films and their critics have decided subtlety is a wonderful thing this movie has decided if some subtlety is good more subtlety must be doubly as good ! '' people who watch the movie are caught between their frustration with the film 'd deliberate inaccessibility and their fear of appearing ignorant when rendering judgement thus you have opinions that hang around on the poles of the extremes with very little in the middle this is not really a dog on the movie itself but you do have to wonder about the kind of people who write reviews and get on message boards that sneer if you do n't like this movie go watch the fast and the furious '' as if anyone who does not like this movie is a greasy cinema philistine the idea that this movie is superior because it does not quote you '' all the answers i would venture that there is a difference between '' answers and being purposefully evasive and disingenuous to the movie audience samantha morton is in this movie that 's cause for a lot of trouble for you see samantha morton is a talented actor i just learned two months ago we 're not supposed to use the word actress anymore who has amassed a cadre of devoted '' re rabid fans who believe that anything she touches turns to gold morton has definitively proved her acting chops in movies like jesus 's son '' sweet and lowdown '' and code 46 '' but went really awry in the saccharine in america '' and the sputtering minority report '' morton is a good actor she 's even a good actor for what she 's given in this movie unfortunately that 's not enough this movie gives her too little or perhaps too much to work with there is too much subtlety to this whole movie blank pages for the audience to ascribe what they think to them you can either decide that look means she 's torn up inside or not you 're given so little to work with you ca n't say either way anyone who claims to have the definitive keys to this movie i would be suspicious of as a fraud out to elevate their standing this movie does n't give you a key or a lock and nowadays that 's supposed to be something to be proud of it 's not you can make a movie in this fashion but it needs for lack of a better word meat '' to it people go and walk and do things and mess around and party but they do n't truly seem to interact with each other or their environment emotions that i think were meant to seem complex and multidimensional seem to be totally ignored a feeling of numbness and even inability for release would be nice but the audience is not even given that halfway through the film we begin to suspect that we 're being strung along and the ending confirms that suspicion stranger still this movie gives off a very anachronistic feel to it the film quality and setting looks like it was made in 1988 or some time in short i do n't care for this movie morton did a good job with what she had to work with but in the end this film just did not do enough confront enough or accomplish enough the way this movie has been structured i believe the reviews on here tell more about the reviewer than the movie this movie is blank pages stare at them try and figure them out make of them what you wish just do n't attempt to pass any of it off as gospel truth
the pretentious film goer has never had a greater ally than lynne ramsay 's morvern callar what is little more than a bland stew of typically successful indy film techniques shot amoral unique hip naked becomes an immenitely defensible but truly awful film to merely skim the surface why morvern is touted as a study of progress liberation or is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack although other indy film goers may crucify the this sort of movie is equally disgusting as the bloated behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision that sort however is only after our money morvern caller is after something much more dangerous our admiration for more information on lynne ramsay 's film see no skin off my nose '' a succesful play prominately featured in the fountainhead
some guy in nyc gets up on a building and starts shooting people in the ketchup packets a father kills his family off camera a policeman shoots a few people in a parade seemingly random acts of violence except that all the perpetrators said god told me to '' shocking ! a detective who 's chest hair shortens dramatically when he walks from the bedroom to the bathroom is assigned to the case and i have no idea what he figures out cause after 70 minutes of talk talk talk i started the play until he came across some wacked out squealing dude in an abandoned building who has a p y on his chest ! the cop beats the guy down then says god told me to '' i never want to see this movie again as long as i live
promising start a sniper kills people seemingly randomly when asked why he says god told me to '' other mass murders occur and the murderers all claim that god told them to do it after 25 minutes the mystery slowly starts to unfold there is a sect '' of middleaged and elderly men who have been gathered telepathically they know what is going on ufo s in the past explain some mysterius births and god '' turns out to be not too impressive why oh why did they try to explain it all so stupidly the movie is dedicated to the memory of bernard herrmann the famous movie music composer vertigo psycho and much more and the music often resembles the intense string music of herrmann there is some good choir music too the acting is good all over good pictures slow tempo but not too slow and the script is good up until one third of the movie so what happened i have three theories 1. after writing script for the first part of the movie the script writer died and the story was completed by someone else since only cohen is credited as writer i guess this theory wo n't hold up 2. they wanted to do a film with some cool music and dedicate it to bernard herrmann so they wrote the music first and then wrote scenes that would fit the music not minding if the story turned out to be rather strange and stupid 3. the script writer had read too much von dniken god is a ufo just look here in ezechiel '' anyway here is another example of a movie that has most thing going for it but lacks a good story to back it up with and a good story means something at least if you try to be clever like this film does this movie is sometimes called demon ''
on tuesday november 30 1982 i had just come home from a scout meeting and i turned on the television and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper and told me to turn it off and i did n't even know the name of this i looked it up in the tv guide later on and unfortunately due to the fact that i was still shaken up by the other night i did n't dare share the name due to the fact i 'd get a sermon i was at a crucial age in my life where i was 15 where i had desires for girls but emotionally i was not prepared for them i can understand the fact that it 's a morally bankrupt film and was capturing the fact of the revolution but i do n't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world 's been turning but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that i guess looking back my parents argument is there 's a time and place for everything '' but guess what that would 've been a perfect time to help me understand i know that a few months later that i brought it up to my aunt who 's a committed christian and she paled which led up to the sermon and to be honest i felt like i could n't win i feel with this movie i had to not let it go until i got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it 's entirety and i did n't get to see this until i was 20 and i brought it back up to my parents as my father 's friend had just opened a video store in cherry hill and the battle started again i have felt like a eunich i did n't get to watch this movie all this time and when i did i found it rather appealling and now wanted to add it to my collection i was getting flack as i actually bought the blank video and tried to get it copied onto the videotape looking back i would 've been better off just buying it but i know i have to wonder if i would 've come to same conclusion i got the tape finally when i was 25 years old and watched it once and since then i lost the appeal i saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from i did n't focus on the colors or the scene where ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by elaine and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that robinson took away ben 's virginity and this was when ben was trying to get together with elaine i found this to be coincidental but rather truthful when i had a woman make a phone call one night when i was working in a convience store and it was a rather seductive one and then the woman just turned it off when i finally met her kind of like robinson doing it to ben and especially when he was in too deep the fact that this happened could 've been an alternative lesson my father could 've taught me if he did n't want to talk about the sexual nature with this mindset i do n't own this anymore and have no inclination or intention of owning it again i ca n't honestly say if i bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would 've made a difference i feel that once i saw the fact that robinson made a blank promise to make ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me this is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would 've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to or it 's implied that it 's a man 's job to have an affair but that 's the world 's standard and morally it 's wrong for either side to cheat on one another it left me feeling that i was n't worth the time to talk about this movie to and about the way the relationships in the movie and made to feel dirty because i wanted to know and angry that i had to repress myself and my feelings and my character to fit this model that pleased my family i just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it and not worry about your parents helping you mind you it is a pg rating so anyone 13 and under not without a parent
all i can say is that this item is very bad i mean it 's trash i 'm sorry to say it but it is 0 star
i was not happy with this purchase this video only taught 10 min of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end the teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds i could have used more teaching and less of a porn show this was a waste of money ! there are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise
if i had the choice i would rate it 0 stars the video talks to people like children and treats the viewer as if they 've had no human contact in their life
this video is very misleading ! ! i was hoping to have some fun and impress my husband with some new moves what i got was a cheesy video showing me how to walk sexy '' per say and had a cheesy porn scene at the end ! my husband watched it later on and laughed his ass off ! if you a tomboy trying to be feminineonly then would i reccomend it for you
i do n't know how i managed to see this gory splatterfest twice in 's a terrible movie next to that other awful movie wild wild west '' which also stars salma hayek quentin tarantino george clooney play a pair of ne'er do wells who take a family end up going to a strip joint filled with evil vampires and battling them until out that the strip joint is built on top of an aztec temple hence the bloodsucking strippers george clooney managed to overcome this as well as batman robin '' to get into syriana '' '' good night and good luck '' he 's a talented actor too bad he could n't save this movie through sheer it comes to heists he 's better in ocean'e eleven '' as a dapper metrosexual avoid this movie unless you really like gruesome violent
the film looks good that can not be denied it looks stylish and is directed with flair unfortunately the script plays out like it 's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age the dialogue is just cringeworthy one can not help but think that someone indulged tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it and made a big boob on all counts i scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its much trumpeted blood and guts did n't produce a single goosebump it was like watching a cartoon disappointing
i actually think cameron is a good technical filmmaker but this is my choice for most overrated movie in history the older black and white movie is much better drama what we have here is really a teenager flick with remarkable and very expensive special effects the acting is at best wooden and the caprio both superb actors sublot is excruciatingly awful i could go on but there are plenty of previous reviews which summarize the lowlights the undoubtedly great effects do make this worth seeing however
how could cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody the production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos but the script and dialogue are so banal the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another including leo who was so good in what 's eating gilbert grape '' in 1993 when i did n't yet know who he was i thought he was really a cute little retarded kid yet in titanic '' there 's just nothing there or nothing permitted talk about a ship wreck ! ! only the two block voting resulted in the oscar
weak forced dialogue silly overly thought plot unsympathetic characters and unfunny and you have kiss kiss bang bang i saw a clip of robert downey accidentally audition for a part from this movie and thought it was going to be a funny movie about a mix up where a crook gets to be come an actor solving a murder mystery instead i got a bunch of unwatchable nonsense with a unbelievable plot uninteresting characters forced unnatural over the top dialogue an annoying robert downey and a supposed love story subplot with zero chemistry the movie is hard to follow which is why they have narration in the beginning since this does n't even resemble any film noir flick i have ever seen at the end i found myself feeling like i wasted 1 hours for characters i did n't care about and a plot i was n't interested in and the worst part is i did n't even laugh one single time robert downey sums it up in narration at the end it 's a dumb movie '' he is right and i do n't understand anyone who thought this was actually a good movie
let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic regardless of the fact that it did n't stick with a few key plotlines in the book everyone still did a great job adapting the original jurassic park then came this piece of trash whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book this one just takes the brilliant writing of michael chrichton and throws it directly out the window first off john hammond is supposed to be dead he dies at the end of the first novel secondly ian malcome is supposedly dead or at least mia at the end of the first book and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the there is no bratty daughter and the entire premise has much more to it most importantly the entire ending in san diego with the which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies did not exist in the book ! i went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist and the anticipation of some good to top it off what i ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page not only that but because of the lack of plot the dino scenes are complete when you see so much of it you lose that awe and wonder of the first film when you see that brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film the wonderment is difficult to rival there are no such moments in this film if you 're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino fx go nuts however if you 're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline flick off the dvd player and pick up the book oh and one more thing do n't go near the movie they did n't even have a book to be untrue to i ca n't imagine how much more and rambling my review would be for that one
i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore yuck ! and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters stay goldblum the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better
1979 alien '' by director ridley scott and 1986 aliens '' by director james cameron are the only movies of this success fox franchise that really were extraordinary films alien '' is consider one of the most extraordinary horror movies of all times mean while aliens '' is considered one of the best movies of all times sadly for the saga the people of fox did a very bad job hiring david fincher to direct alien 3 '' and the french guy jeunet who direct aliens resurrection ''
this movie is silly at best racist at worse i ca n't believe ice cube actually wrote the script for this mess my opinion of ice cube has been drastically lowered it 's the old black jiving and shucking all over again this movie has all the classic black stereotypes it even has a scene where smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he 's a chicken remember the old minstrel shows nobody in here but us chickens '' there 's no plot to speak of just a bunch of insults getting high stealing money potty jokes black people knocking each other upside the head some character get punched out and smokey chris tucker goes over and yells in his face dude you been knocked out ! '' that 's a typical joke '' from this movie how about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog hilarious after watching this dvd with my family we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene and we could n't think of a single one
i did n't believe the negative reviews but i 'm a believer now ! and i do n't mean that i believe in et ! i gave this movie one star only because there was no choice i ca n't decide whether this is actually intended as but it is chock full of bad science sprinkled liberally with comedy the title however is very accurate without warning '' i sure did n't see it coming ! by the way if you would like to purchase a copy of this thriller i happen to have one that was watched less than once it was just too overwhelming and i could n't sit through it all ! well got ta go have more important things to do like count fly specks on the wall
when i saw the movie it was so predictable halfway into it the broadcasts were so lame as well as the total of war of the worlds '' reminded me of an movie from the early 80 's called special bulletin '' much better with it 's ! the only thing i liked about this movie when i switched back to catch it 's climax ending they never even saw their doom sure put 's the military in it 's place !
i am pretty easy to please when it comes to budget high budget does n't movie is actually the worst movie i have ever seen in my 45 years of totally not believable and the writing and directing was shabby at n't waste your hard earned bucks on this lemon ! ! ! !
this is the worst movie i ever seen there was no subject no story iam very sorry for buying this film
the '' tv movie had already be done and done better ten years ealier as special bulletin '' where the first movie took its subject nuclear disarmament and terrorism seriously this does n't respect the viewers ' intelligence at all they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera not of it ties together in any coherent way and the make love not war '' ending reeks of sophistry
i enjoyed the book so much that i ran out and bought the dvd although it was and entertaining to a degree i must say that i was somewhat disappointed for starters this miniseries is far too long it dragged on painfully at times and could easily have been cut by a full hour and very possibly two also it focuses almost entirely on the struggle of the main characters while omitting most of the interesting scientific narrative and anecdotes that make the book so fascinating the impact of the story is severely diminished without this narrative moreover i think it is difficult to figure out what is happening during most of the series unless you have read the book first it is unclear why many of the secondary characters exist and their interactions with the main characters are virtually inscrutable at times all in all it is obvious that a significant effort went into this series but i think it could have been better
not a bad video but extremely easy i am not in great shape and it does n't really challenge me but if you are really just starting to work out it might be a good video to try
was not what i expected it does not spend enough time on any particular area of the body to really work it
warning ! this video has no captioning i 've rented it and it does not have captioning it is useless to me and fellow deaf and hard of hearing folk
ahhhh what a great movie i cry at the end every time i remember when i was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of apollo 13. however i am severely dissappointed with the widescreen dvd those who created it did not use the original film but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen vhs version there are many instances when this is evident but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the lovell house after the walk on the moon when jim says i want to go back there '' when the scene opens he is cut off at and you never see below his knees on the fullscreen vhs you can see his shoes when i buy the widescreen i want the whole movie not less than the fullscreen vhs tape bad bad bad bad bad buy the vhs
i 'm a huge john wayne fan but this movie has some serious shortcomings including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that while acceptable at the time are not so well received today i wo n't knock john wayne 's acting however because he performed it as only john wayne could but some of the other acting was downright daffy like when the singing eddie powers william frawley was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine the fighting seabees was n't a totally bad movie and i thought the formation of the seabees if this movie is accurate was very interesting but some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better
this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking these really make the movie crawl one minute there 's action next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism seriously these little talks take up of the movie the visuals are awesome no question about that even so they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story altogether not much actually happens during the movie if you must see it rent it first to be sure you want it
before i review i 'd like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name which i have not read so i do n't know which is more accurate but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i do n't like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that 's the biggest problem there 's not really enough story to last a feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short and since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes there are barely any and they are n't very impressive for the most part they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60 of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing or a woman 's nipples that 's not cinematic artistry that 's being either lazy or perverted the animation itself is n't even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago it 's choppy and there 's not really a whole lot of detail except when it comes to women 's nipples looking at just the animation if i did n't know better i 'd have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980 's the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it 's probably kind of like how i did n't see the 1989 batman movie until years after i 'd been spoiled by batman the animated series and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you 're you 're at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you 'll find a lot to love but i ca n't say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex
sorry to give you the bad news about this dvd set but i love the kids in the hall but found the complete season one dissapointing i remember some wonderful and very humorus skits in season one that were not included in this set such as the crushing the head man with his friend misha who interupts the play he is putting on the actors in his play are his fingers as he goes to crush her head she sticks her thumb in front of one eye and says there 's no body home '' so it appears that her thumb is covering his head but this skit is n't in here why as a lover of the head crusher the only head crushing episodes in season one are when he crushes business men 's heads and runs into a little boy in a suit and asks him what do you want to be when you grow up '' the little boy responds a business man ! '' he consquently gets his head crushed funny but not the best or most memorable of the head crusher i also was disspointed in buddy cole in this dvd set there were some wonderful buddy cole segments in the first season that are not in this set how about the one when he is in jail and his tin cup is shaped like a champagne glass the same for the chicken lady blind date attending wedding to the bearded lady or phone sex line and cabbage head i loved it when he invited himself along to join a bunch of women who were trying to have dinner as he sits in a lawn chair with a sex book and asks questions i also loved the skit where a woman played by one of the kids in drag sits at an outdoor cafe is annoyed by a terrible waiter and suffers further aggravation from the dirty man standing behind the fence '' who is trying to bum cigarettes for his kids '' from her or how about the guy that stubbed his toe and does n't want to go to the doctor because he found the colors of his infected toe interesting ! '' not one of these hillarious skits or episodes are included in the season one dvd collection why god only knows who compiled the collection of sometimes boring comedy skits in the season one dvd collection but i can tell you one thing there is no way this is a complete collection of the entire season one episodes it is incomplete to say the least i just gave you many examples of my favorites that are missing it would have been great to see them again and have them to enjoy for posterity it was that kind of humor that endeared us all to the kids in the hall so much the skits included in this collection are probably not the most popular or funny episodes i would not recommend it take it from me save yourself twenty or thirty bucks i have not seen the other dvd collections from the other kids in the hall seasons on dvd as yet one can only hope that they will be more entertaining than season one was or should i say was n't i would not have even rated this dvd set one star but it was the lowest rating you can give an item
into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites having seen the pbs presentation of this i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play the staging by forcing the viewer 's perspective this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director 's vision

i purchased this movie because i love chris cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive i played the movie yesterday and boy was i disappointed the movie was much too slow and boring i love mysteries and hate dramas therefore i thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what i thought was going to be a good mystery story in the end the mystery is solved with a thud and do n't get me started on the quasi luke leia moment at the end please !
for those familiar with and sympathetic toward the story of whitley strieber this movie is worth watching once although you will likely find it disappointing for the uninitiated whitley streiber is a science fiction writer who claims to have been abducted probed and otherwise hassled by alien life forms communion is based on his book of the same name the first book from a series that details his alleged interactions with little grey men walken is perfect for the role and he seems to relish the opportunity to release his weirdness so freely fans of walken such as myself also owe this one viewing though like our counterparts most of us will also be disappointed for each chilling moment in the film and there are a few there is a sibling moment which is overly amateurish and undeniably boring the dialogue during near the end of the movie where walken 's streiber character contemplates the aliens with his wife while perusing an art gallery is poorly written and the actors clearly know it the soundtrack is guitar wankery a closing scene where walken gets chummy with some aliens is confusing and embarrassing to watch this movie could have been good it should have been good another six months writing the screenplay might have gotten it there
this was a complete waste walken is good but god what a waste ! i never finished strieber 's first book which had intrigued me but in succeeding books he does nothing to prove anything he gives a tale of experience that borders on religion this horrible suspenseless and cheap film gives nothing to redeem strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke maybe i should n't be so harsh on it after all i 'm not a ufo reasercher or whatnot but i 'm still human i still have opinions and my opinion of this is yuck
i rate this and impromptu '' and also maybe the piano '' as films that are so impressed with themselves and their supposed pedigree they do n't have to work '' and the results are a rather tedious series of costumes pictures statements and events maybe it was the creator 's intent but at the end of this movie you do n't give a crap about this egomaniacal woman and her emotional patchwork of a life just on the two hours you 'll never get back having endured this drivel
and to be honest i hated it she has that dramatic face in every movie it always looks as if she 's going to burst into tears or something so she 's mostly just fit it seems to me anyway for these tragic no hope for mankind '' plenty is a movie so that you should never watch it on a day you feel tired or something you 'll only get deeply depressed and do not misunderstand me i am no fan of shallow comedies i 'm moved by actors like hopkins in shadowlands and penn in dead man walking but the woman streep plays in this movie well how many women could identify themselves with her what is plenty trying to tell us two stars for stings ' effort as mick in the movie not a big role but his character has sex '' with streep and is basically used by her and finally mick is the first to call her character insane '' if i remember right big deal no but i am a big fan of sting therefor let me add are you a add this to your but watching the movie is pain !
uneven choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable meryl streep unfortunately not even the fabulous streep can save this recommended for devoted fans only bent on completing their streep collection
if you love well written stories great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you i do n't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie however there it is ! it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off i do n't even want to know how it ended the cast line up was great ! that 's the only 'positive ' comment i can make with regards to this movie do not watch it do not hire it do not believe anybody who thinks it is good the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly get this it was done in the missionary position ! avoid this movie
when a friend and i read the back of the dvd at blockbuster we were intrigued by the plot not to mention the incredible cast we checked it out with anticipation of a great flick i wouldnt even consider what we were feeling as dissapointment i would describe what we felt as pure regret ! the acting on the part of elle mcpherson was awful ! the character development in this movie was null and void i dont understand how other reviewers can say that this was a fabulous movie depicting real life situations about women i dont know about you but i dont have internal conflict with everyday lesbian experiences my mother never tricked me in to thinking i was adopted so that i 'd get along with my siblings i dont know what happened in the other two 'chapters ' because we turned this atrocity of a movie off after 2 hours of pure hell if you want to make a movie about womens issues make a movie about our rights our health issues being a mother etc this was just a poorly written script with a good cast who couldnt even save it from the depths of the hideousness that is called a girl thing
this movie should have won an oscar the acting was superb kate capshaw and elle mcpherson were so convincing as lesbians their common interest of jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians but them of course is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes the writing is amazing the nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more stockard channing was aspiring as a pyschologist she made me feel like i could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant the stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life the twists and turns provided in the three sisters story was like a m night shyamalan movie i wo n't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise ! all in all i feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss with dialogue like two men saying over an over again and heartwarming original characters like alice or claire a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend i feel like i should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber
i do n't like giving negative reviews and i do n't usually give one star but i ca n't think of anything else to rate this movie when i first read all of the positive reviews i thought maybe this was a movie worth watching but i was sorely disappointed when i did get a chance to watch the dvd what really was the purpose of making this movie and i do n't think that anybody is jealous or player hating on they 're just being honest about this crappy movie goodness i had to skip through to the end it was so boring and just i ca n't even think of words to describe it and what was so cute about evan ross saying that he had gotten some cuttie is that supposed to inspire other young black boys to do the same cute thing
if mtv was smart and they used to be along with funny relevant and entertaining they even played music videos all the time ! it was on all day in my house and you could always count on the vjs passing along some wacky facts or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently anyway mtv could make their massive video catalog available to the public you could browse online and choose the videos you wanted pay 3 each and mtv would either create a custom dvd for you and send it out or you could download them and make your own dvds i would gladly pay to have several dvds that contained only the videos i wanted and there are about 100 i want just off the top of my head as it is i am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on classic rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos 4 of which i may want the rest i do n't this one did nothing for me luckily it was a gift i never would 've bought it for myself
getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth and they were all for buying it
we have watched all of the movies in this collection some of the movies about are either inaudible hard to understand what the actors are saying skip parts because the film is so old my husband and i watched at least 3 of the movies per week and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this horror '' collection are nowhere near the horror '' movies we watched on saturday matinees at the movies in the over half belong in the mystery '' or comedy '' category and what 's with all the gorillas every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it these horror movies are from the to the and are much more tame than todays horror flicks granted but come on why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie again there were too many gorillas ! not that there 's anything wrong with gorillas but we prefer ghosts to gorillas
this is a horror '' movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage i do n't mean the acting is garbage though it is i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a murder wave then bingo i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat blow away the cast
thinking about this film after watching it it 's a fairly decent piece of work until the ending still the parallels between rosemary 's baby and director roman polanski 's personal life are striking mia farrow plays a derivative stepford wife impregnated whilst unconscious by the prince of darkness as the basis for a horror movie that 's a good start i 'd have chosen perhaps barry goldwater or maybe even polanski circa his days when he himself raped a drugged girl but the devil makes nearly as good a villain how eerie then that polanski 's own wife would have her life and her pregnancy terminated by a bunch of just after this movie debuted anyway the movie is paced well and the story is interesting i really enjoyed how she pieced together the evidence of a conspiracy i to be asleep before it ended but more than two hours later i was on the edge of my seat watching rosemary track down her newborn 's thieves with a kitchen knife and what would she do with that knife ! i wo n't spoil it for you but when she enters the neighbor 's apartment you can turn your dvd player off you wo n't miss a thing in fact any ending you dream up will be better than what actually happens and that was the biggest problem with this film other people have mentioned it too the ending sucks it really made me feel as though i 'd wasted two hours of my life i was hoping for a violent vengeful ending but no nothing like that happens other things i did n't like after rosemary swears off minnie 's vitamin drinks you see her drinking at least one more of them ! what happened and why does she keep visiting dr sapirstein after she realizes he 's in on it plot holes you could drive a fleetwood hearse through
bad not a good movie i feel like to get the point across the 4 principal 's performances could have been slightly more vacant and detached n'est pas it just goes on and on scenes upon scenes that do n't really build upon anything or each other and then it ends implausibly do n't waste your time on this one
i generally admire jennifer aniston 's work so i picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn sadly watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie if you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes you would't miss much since nothing really happens if it 's a comedy it is n't funny if it 's a slice of life the lives are deadly dull the emotional level is so you suspect the entire group is on valium jenifer aniston especially seems to have phoned this one in real characters as it happens i 've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these characters if they 're actually representative of real americans then we 're in big trouble ! my wife i had the same reaction at the end of this one that '' s it ! ! ''
i would have given this film a slightly higher rating had it been filled with characters i admired or to whom i related i mean aniston 's character gets set up with a real jerk by one of her best friends who knows this guy talks disrespectfully about women aniston meanwhile does a good job of playing a depressed to people character who gets taken advantage of catherine keener 's marriage seems troubled because she is overly concerned with other people 's feelings and her husband seems blase about them including those of his wife 's it 's sort of an okay character driven movie in terms of the acting but the ending is not pieced together in a gratifying way it sort of just leaves you there hanging with nothing concluded
first off this is a very wordy wan na be woody allen type film which means just not funny in the trailer they did pick a few of the humerous parts but it just really is n't a comedy secondly if the characters would just shut up once in a while and actually work on their problems epecially jennifer aniston 's character then the characters would get things done in their lives therapy is what aniston 's character really needed or a boot to the head true friends would have gotten her help before she got to where she did in this film there were parts that were amusing because it depicted real life scenerios and pointed out irony but that gets old real quick this movie did have a good cast and a reasonable message that friends are what matter and that true friendship comes easy by being yourself that is what gets this film two stars rent this movie do n't buy it but best if you borrow this from someone else who rents it i only saw it because my wife rented it you wo n't want to see it twice
was looking forward to seeing this film quite disappointing joan cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing jennifer anniston is usually pretty good but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny i felt just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line not a film i will be watching again sadly
dull and pointless how could jennifer aniston read this script and think that doing this film was a good idea we had to turn it off about through shallow boring superficial take your pick it 's like a contest which character 's life sucks the most if you 're going to depress people at least make it interesting would it have been so hard for the writers to mix in a plot with their nihilism
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50 's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man with firth as the anchor of the team the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives but i found truth '' confusing and unengaging i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo and as several have noted lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible give this one a pass
sounds like a man with a chip on his shoulder a lot of pent up anger hardly a spiritual place to be jesus was innoncent too michael
he told us what was wrong with current is the replacement and where is the scientific backing for his view
deep deceptions was not what it was advertised to be in the advertisement it was to explain about how the divinci code just scratched the surface the dvd talks about heaven and hell and nothing new or different about religion
you know it 's interesting when you open the ramtha web site of the school of wisdom '' one finds a high school essay in neoplatonic metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats however when you hit the link that says who is ramtha you get a this information is not available '' message kinda makes you go hhmmmmmmm ! ! ! now do n't get me wrong folks edgar cayce and the author of a course in miracles might have tapped into something but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative it kind of reminds me of the lines in the revenge of the sith movie that palpatine gave to anakin to turn him to the dark side ! ! ! ! ! you know this fellow even sounds like a character from a flik you know esteemed jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the sith or even tolkien 's saruman hey folks get christopher lee 's opinion of the dvd before you fork over your hard earned bucks and uh do a search on this ramtha spirit er channeled er thingy ! ! ! live long and prosper ! !
the human race today is in a really bad state mainly because most people do not want to wake up they want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power '' miceal ledwith in the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions i thoroughly enjoyed the dvd what the bleep do we know ! '' mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists theologians and mystics i also enjoyed ramtha 's dvd create your day '' even though it was n't quite as good as the bleep cameos it was with great expectations that i viewed the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions by miceal ledwith unfortunately the plodding pace of the 57 minute dvd as well as the ramblings of ledwith was very disappointing ledwith brings up some great points in this dvd but never goes beyond the surface he asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the hamburger universe '' the vault of the heavens '' overhead with the vault of hell underneath yet instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk he makes nebulous comments without explaining the what and why '' he mentions string theory quantum physics and the true '' nature of the big bang going on to say that levitation is n't a miracle '' but only a matter of superseding gravity with the torsion field '' the problem is that he 's tossing about these terms in support of jesus ' words that ye are all gods '' and greater works than these shall you do '' without actually explaining the meaning or of a torsion field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws fyi the torsion field is quantum spin waves of empty space einstein and elie cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920 's the theory could possibly be used to explain esp among other things ledwith spends a good portion of the dvd highlighting the silliness of traditional christianity including the clouds and harps of heaven he goes on and on about how a cloud is in reality damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on duh and that if one were to play the harp for eternity they 'd wear down the fingers to the third knuckle i understand highlighting the damage that traditional christian thought has caused humanity especially in terms of evolution in fact as a former minister trained in theology myself i probably get it '' more than most but while poking fun at christian thought is popular these days you had have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions especially if you want to be a part of the thinking '' christian apologists know their bible inside and out so if ledwith wants to undermine their illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise theology heck even at a simplified level all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by christians and others of course yet god the father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever apologists would say well humans choose to go to hell '' the interesting thing is that the bible says no man can come to the father except the holy spirit draws him '' because his understanding is darkened '' this is just one of the many points that ledwith could bring up but instead he preaches to the new age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions primarily christianity via nebulous assertions in fairness ledwith makes excellent points but nothing that you could n't get much more eloquently from marianne williamson gary zukav eckhart tolle neale donald walsch and others some of these points are '' we are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us '' if jesus were on earth today he would n't recognize his own teachings '' anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the the hostility the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race '' we do n't realize how following another 's image of god is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting we do n't even think of it '' the flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today '' we 've never gotten rid of the inquistatorial mind to this day '' the answers we 've been given by religion are bizarre emotionally charged and childish '' heaven varies according to the broker christian denomination but the basis is pretty much the same earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven '' god is just a human magnified in monotheism we take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the divine as a result we 're left with something so sentimental mawkish and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality '' whatever god is has no gender these childish images are holding us back '' ledwith makes other interesting comments but they beg for elaboration one such comment is '' that jesus ' death was to appease the vengeance of a savage god this had nothing to do with what jesus christ did '' i 'd love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion ! spiritual teachers such as williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of christ does ledwith have a clue as to why jesus died if he did why did n't he share it he quotes jesus by saying greater works than i shall you do '' attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential mostly due to a flat earth mentality what he fails to mention however is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of greater works '' meizona toutn in the greek in terms of whether greater '' refers to quantity versus quality my greek professor made a case for the former saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers ledwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in new age circles attributing it 's not our weakness that frightens us it 's our power '' to nelson mandela the actual quote is our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure '' which was uttered by marianne williamson in her book a return to love '' one of ledwith 's comments that i found particularly insightful is as human knowledge grows the territory of god shrinks god becomes a refugee '' the god of the gaps '' as he called it are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we do n't yet understand an example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of zeus despite this interesting observation it 's not enough to enliven the rest of the dvd what separates the tight insightful segements in what the bleep do we know ! '' from this dvd is that the conversations captured in bleep were the result of directors chasse arntz and vincente asking probing questions of the experts questions borne out of the directors ' own curiosity and personal paths on the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions however ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly which does n't make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe perhaps this is more the fault of director '' jz knight in the end i could n't help but feel like this dvd was thrown together in order to capitalize on bleep 's popularity let 's hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter deeper and smarter
chamber '' was always the worst entry in the harry potter series but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse choppy editing horrible humor personified by the untalented rupert grint smug acting by the equally untalented emma watson poor screenwriting by that hack steve kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack chris columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience skip it if you can
is it me or is it the film i watched my copy of the special edition the other night and there were words missing from the dialogue in various parts of the film now i wish that i did n't give my gold version away
i suppose i should have realised that if i hated l'avventura '' i would probably hate this too just wish i 'd thought of that before buying it ponderous slow arty a milestone in cinematic history and all that but terribly off putting and in some instances terribly obvious in its ennui there will be much on your part you probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course really good package by criterion though
ok so it 's boring as hell pointless with no plot and about characters who are not even remotely interesting then how come this film is actually good because you feel obliged to think so antonioni is a big name you know
the value of this collection is in some ways priceless imagine '' a collection that could get us all five beatles ' films for an affordable price the rating is n't for the very good release 'help ' or for the flawed idiocyncratic random but sometimes groundbreaking and interesting 'magical mystery tour ' and all of the gravy of the accompanying rockumentaries '' hopefully the capitalist version of trickle down economics will materialize the way it did for players and walkman when the prolitariat will be able to afford all five beatles ' movie dvd 's either separately or together by the way although the bickering on 'let it be ' not included here or barely anywhere else is legendary so is the music for those who have seen the last beatle film the strife is enlightening but overrated can we have that movie please for myself i only saw it once at a mark lapidos ' beatles ' convention where all you could hear was the vaudeville yeahs '' and boos '' for allegedly dudley do right and snively whiplash paul mccartney and yoko ono respectively personally not to regress too much but while mccartney helped make the world happy yoko made john happy so at the expense of ranting make us happy and give us the movies we want
reading other reviews of this movie i am surprised that i am the only one who felt pretty offended by this movie i read the book just a while ago and loved it so i was excited about seeing the movie big let down ! first of all they change one of the main character 's names and for no good reason that i can see there is no relation between the allison mckenzie of the book and the one in the movie they are completely differenct characters ! when i read the book i felt that i was reading a serious piece of literature that was uncovering a small town 's egotistical view of itself which let 's face it is pretty common in many human societies metalious was making a commentary on how her community was repressive of individuality and free expression the movie seemed more concerned with whether lana turner 's character was ever going to get a little action moreover the most commonly used words in reviews of the movie are melodrama and soap opera now when i think of melodrama and soap opera i think of dallas days of our lives and 90210. basically trash that presents mindless unbelievable situations metalious ' book was done a grave injustice by this movie i am still trying to figure out how she was a script consultant and allowed this to get to film
the firm lower body sculpt dvd did not meet my expectations not enough info was offered to let you know that you need to purchase additional equipment the fanny lifter in order to do the workout so once i got the dvd i could not get stared right away the moves are very slow not enough repetitions too many routine changes not to mention the lack of enthusiasm by the instructors lines are definitely learned not unisex friendly i could not see my husband working out with me to that routine ! more for stepford wives '' i have heard that the firm series from the 1980 's is better than the current but i'am not going to experiment i 'll continue to work out to my billy blanks videos
i 'm not qualified to disagree with the glowing reviews of the acting but i was annoyed by the way the flashbacks were done i suppose it was a metaphor for what iris must have been going through but lots of people are slutty or succumb to alzheimer 's what made iris noteworthy was her writing to focus on the former and almost entirely omit the latter is shamelessly manipulative and it made my girlfriend who lost a grandparent to alzheimer 's cry i suppose the moral of the story is do n't watch movies read books instead
when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue you may as well turn it off the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash
well the title seems to fit the dvd fast '' but in a different aspect as far as time goes i thought this was very boring and slow but it was over in no time at all it probably would be great for someone just beginning and has very little or no time at all to exercise and it does n't work up a sweat it was very very easy to do and i 'm a beginner myself
this video has a long introduction and commercials commericials at the beginning and the end there is a lot of wasted time i found it an extremely inefficient use of my time i am returning it today
i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i did n't want to leave the house i was a little disappointed in this dvd i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising the routines are broken down into four separate workouts the only one that involved any effort on my part was the section as for the rest the other sections would have you do too few reps i felt to get your muscles warmed up let alone reshape them i think this dvd is great for beginners its simple enough to follow and it wo n't scare you away too soon but if you 're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine this probably is n't the abs workout for you
in 2005 we took a weekend trip from baton rouge la to natchitoches la where fifteen years earlier the filming of steel magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened having never seen the movie we rented it as soon as we got back home everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments mine was my sense that this was one of the cutest '' movies i 'd ever seen and i 'd had quite enough cute '' lately especially after sitting through will smith in hitch '' the accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of the beverly hillbillies though more embarrassing than funny one '' moment that pretty funny was the few characters ' effort to shoot some crows '' out of a tree so that they wo n't all over the reception '' their creative use of a crossbow is a classic sad to say there is n't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin there was also some choppiness between scenes as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop i can think of two scenes in particular one where the wig clairee played by the belle olympia dukasis buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times in another scene the darryl hannah hard to recognize committed christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the lord 's name in vain neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story dolly parton is her usual big hair big smile big self as the lead hairdresser shirley maclaine has a very unsympathetic character as the eatonton 's julie and sally and family neighbor the male characters are more or less wasted especially the estimable sam shepard who spends most of the film underneath a car or sitting lifelessly in front of a tv the movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half which became more dramatic sally field has a pretty good scene near the end she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character julia roberts as shelby overall i thought that steel magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of natchitoches la given that the locals seemed not to mind too much i may be overreacting they even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene
excited popped it in the dvd player opening sequence perfect scene 2 no audio scene 3 4 had audio scene 5 no audio do not purchase unless you enjoy closed captioning lip reading or returning dvds to amazon
i looked at the name groovaloos and i looked at the cover and my gut told me not to get this dvd i went against my gut and believed the reviews i wish i 'd listened to my gut for those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey you 're right on the money they can all dance but compared to what i expected they seemed mediocre here 's the lowdown 1 the sound sucks they 're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine but the music is n't loud enough to really feel '' something that makes you want to move 2 they just seem like a group of people who do n't naturally have a rhythm but they 've learned some moves it 's so not inspiring 3 it 's not edgy enough and 4 it looks good if you 've got a group doing it but when someone 's doing it alone it 's just okay overall this dvd was okay but not great get it only if you 're truly desperate
just received the german 4 disc digipak good news played 10 mins of both no problems menus are all in english or german all the extra 's on the english se 's are here except for the photo gallery the sound is very good and the restored english mono is better than the mgm 5.1 also on here with the commentary and german mono the 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation picture no problems i could see on my screen via infocus 5700 projector from an arcam dvd player player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything only watched first of each but doing comparisons with the english mgm se 's the german ones are noticeably better they look less washed out contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on fistful which is why i bought this set but also on few dollars more as well they are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly few dollars more is at last the full version which no mgm dvd is worldwide
i consider buckethead a unique artist with an original vision the manifestation of that vision on his anniversary dvd while intriguing and amusing is for only his most devoted fans i 've liked some of his stuff on youtube and saw the dvd by chance passing through a store in a mall and took a chance bad decision i can go along with the cheapo depot '' look and vibe but when it comes down to delivering content this is a bloated nearly unwatchable video the content is presented in two disks but it should have been one the live concert material on disk 2 looks as if shot on consumer grade video cameras featuring bucket playing along to tracks doing the robot and a display of his skills the music with doses of country chicken pickin and classical flavors sounds largely the same from song to song frankly i was bored the is an experiment gone wrong his phibes meets yngvie meets the dark side of disney is realized as an unfocused mess on this package the result it had on me is that i am unlikely to buy another dvd or song from him without checking into reviews first so buyer beware memo to buckethead find someone to focus your vision and move on to the next phase of your career
i feel i should preface by saying that i love this band to death however for fans only is pretty shoddy every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect that being said it 's not without merit i just wish it had been put together better
i run hot and cold with clint eastwood hot with movies like outlaw josey wales '' and dirty harry '' unforgiven '' ranks right up there with '' bridges of madison county '' as two of the most boring movies i 've ever seen sorry fans
i was a huge fan of the books growing up and a lover of the period and jannette oke 's books i had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series well i just finished and could hardly stop from yawning while i watched ! the movie started out well enough wonderful filming great costuming glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time no the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie the scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch i remembered the tomboyish missie from the last film and could n't wait to see her older the actress portraying the older missie just did not do her justice ! while she was pretty she read most of her lines flat with little emotion the worst was the very ending which was supposed to have been a moment between father and daughter instead fell completely flat in fact most of the scenes with missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left i think there were several attempts to portray missie as spirited like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid missie we were continually seeing apart from that the rest of the cast was average with a few star moments here and there i ca n't remember the book very well to check for accuracy but the story was as well melodrama only reared its head in a few places only if you want to keep with the series i would recommend this otherwise i 'm glad they replaced missie 's actress for the next film perhaps we 'll get to see a more energetic performance
please ! ! ! will somebody please put out a real movie on these beloved series by a canadian author ! ! ! ! i and my daughters all loved the books when we found there was movies made we rented them with anticipation only to be very dissapointed ! ! ! i really hope that someday someone will put out a real movie with the real events of the stories written by janette oke ! ! ! they are wonderful stories and need to be made into beautiful movies if i was janette oke i would be so very disappointed with these movies that do n't come close to the books she wrote it was just so dissapointing
the concept of rumspringa '' in which some of the world 's most conservative people run wilder than most of us ever do is fascinating then why is 's so boring the beginning is amazing when we get our first glimpse at the debauchery of an amish youth party the rest of the film unfortunately is pure tedium as the filmmakers focus on a few kids who stray rather far into drugs and other vices but who just are n't very interesting one in particular a crystal meth dealer and user gets endless attention and we just see him ramble about nothing much for minute after minute the fact that he was formerly amish does not make his pathetic life much more interesting than that of the next white trash loser another amish is a girl who appears to have serious emotional problems and who decides to go to college that is all i learned about her in the movie and it could have been conveyed in about 30 to 60 seconds instead the director goes back to the girl again and again to pad out the film 's running time even though she has nothing additional to tell us meanwhile we are not given much context for any of this do most amish kids stray this far before coming back do some not stray at all do the adults really just sit idly by for all of it after seeing this movie i have no idea i just know about a few kids who fell pretty far from the tree and who are n't very interesting in themselves it seems many of the amish shown here do not reflect typical ethnic traits which goes unexplained it is also clear that some of the amish people we see including the adults who allowed themselves to be interviewed on camera are from substantially different amish sects so does this stuff go on among all the amish or just in some weird group of amish or what the film never explains other things irritate such as use of the same soundtrack music over and over why the filmmaker thought the electronic music of aphex twin was the best choice to represent the unplugged '' world of the amish i do n't know the footage in this film could have been used to make an interesting news magazine segment it does not work as a barely feature length documentary
i loooove the recent batch of french films that have made it big '' over here the taste of others '' un air de famille '' and especially the dinner game '' but this an utter bore that just does n't do anything or go anywhere pass on this and instead definitely see the other three mentioned above
this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee another movie with a black guy hello eddie murphy who because it 's perfectly fine in pc hollyweird calls charlie sheen and everyone else who is not black a host of nasty names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist tucker plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a but like most of his other movies he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter '' '' hey bob what will we have tucker do next hey i know let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second screenwriter '' hey great idea fred i sure do n't have any ideas '' apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor i pity you
this movie is so freakin stupid yes its funny but so very dumb not good dumb bad dumb terribly painfully stupid funny at times best avoided or taken in small doses
viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time many of those films that stand the test of time are from the fantasy genre including labyrinth and dark crystal would i add neverending story to that list hell no the dubbing is atrocious funny germans and the costumes and effects '' are bad labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days and easily trumped neverending story when it was released two years later the story and plot had the potential to be interesting but the execution makes neverending fall flat and sure neverending story may have advocated reading in the 's but labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics which is the next step up for mind expansion
unwatchable ! ! ! ! ! over rated poet singers who sing off key aggrandizing this mediocrity is ludicrous
i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5. in my mind this is a whole new venture one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley 's a great hero this movie was pretty bad the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the special effects i felt like i was watching a scooby doo version of alien whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money the plot and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much each of the first four alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of sigourney 's involvement this one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair
ok i have seen this movie a couple of times and i can only give it 2 stars because will melt your ears with tons of unnecessary cursing ! i mean bad cussing ! they went way overboard with the expletives and ruined what could have been a very good dawn of the dead sequel ! the first scary moment with the woman 's dream where she 's looking at a calender and the zombies hiding in the dark this movie had such possibilities too bad they ruined it with such foul language ! would a true horror movie fan forgive the cussing and buy it anyway not me that 's for sure ! although if you 're not offended in the slightest by profanities you might but i ca n't imagine any person being so callous
this is a bad ponderous and silly movie romero took the whole apocolyptic thing way too far there is no tension fear or suspense in this movie the acting is horrible especially with the goofy henchman used to assist the tyranical military leader night of the living dead was a brilliant idea dawn '' cleverly took the premise and applied it to an urban setting day '' stunk
francisco was right this film is about as as buttcrust the review on the back of the dvd says jaw dropping but the full quote probably reads jaw dropping because i was lulled to sleep like a baby '' there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage in the zombie attack scenes but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie the rest of this film consists of the whines and infighting of the human characters and extremely unlikable caricatures of a and extremely redundant evil side of human nature '' message that would be better left to jean renoir or even adam sandler considering the results here i do n't watch zombie movies for the characters especially characters so vapid and unengaging it seemed like the script writer read a novice 's how to pamphlet and said yeah it needs some conflict '' if these characters were n't so constipated and bloated i 'd give them a chance one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of social commentary '' but that 's just a mindless observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully it was n't you 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass the critical ambitions of this movie are and embarassing and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent which is you guessed it the lovely undead the rest is monotonous dreck i do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags all that aside the ending is the worst anticlimatic in the history of horror movies a horror movie that sucks for of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself but the at the end makes you wan na kick the director in the gonads sorry but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin moron
night of the living dead dawn of the dead and creepshow is the very best of george romero ! ! ! the rest is ok but this one is baaaaad ! ! ! ! boring ! ! stupid story and complicated blah blah blah ! ! not too much violence bad zombie very little action and suspense acting and a senseless ending the blood and and gore was sooo coool ! but that 's it ! ! sorry adios
there was one scary moment in this movie the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she that was creepy i then awaited more moments like that nothing nada lame tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb and that young boy what is up with that he 's trying to be like the kid in the sixth sense who was brilliant and totally believable this movie did not scare me and the idea of people being afraid to use vhs tapes after this come on
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is cool this time he 's trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film it 's like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the lakers and the staples center get a plug it 's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it as usual uma 's acting is simply dreadful i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad how she became a star '' in hollywood is beyond me she is not attractive nor can she act she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles they call her john travolta is not much better his version of cool '' just does n't do it for me his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes they were so funny i had to see them again cedric the entertainer was also pretty good
the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said hey do n't forget the book ! '' but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit be cool '' provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there 's too little to sustain a feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a the rock does the best he can but again 's a gay bodyguard ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he 's an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman 's performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there 's just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch shorty'again or read cool '
all style '' and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer '' please go away i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over
i have not seen this movie nor do i ever want to i 've only seen the previews on tv and read about it in previews why do i think it 's probably one of the stupidest pointless movies on the face of the earth because i bet just about every guy who 's had trouble getting girls watched it took notes and believed each and every single thing that was in this movie and believed every sentence that was in this movie where you got to hear the woman thinking out loud in the movie i bet many guys took this movie way too seriously well i bet some of the stuff said in there where it has the woman thinking out loud was garbage not all women are the same and not all men are the same you ca n't believe every thing a woman says not all women want what that one individual woman wants and some women lie but hey nobody 's perfect every guy had individual tastes too and guys lie sometimes to i for one as far what i finad sexually appealing with a woman 's appearance like women who are a tad bigger i like'em to weigh about 140 to 160 lbs if they 're around '' to '' yet there are guys who like petite women i personlly do n't know why there should n't be a movie that tries to help guys get girls the movie title what women want '' was just wrong i bet many guys thought of it as the gateway to seriously improving their game if they 're looking for a date i personally think guys put way too much emphasis on trying to find out what women want i do n't think that should be necessary i think it 's ridiculous i think the guy should be himself like the girl is practially all the time and just feel good about himself not every girl is going to be into every guy i think is probably the most important thing for a guy to have when trying to get women i 'm a guy and that 's my opinion
there 's one thing you will learn at the end of this movie and it is n't even the title that mel gibson is a good looking man that 's pretty much it so mel can read women 's minds so cue lots of scenes of women checking him out forming clear straight sentences in their minds does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie if anyone could read anyone 's mind would n't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish half sentences words songs and ideas but i digress i can buy any premise if it 's well thought out and for a comedy funny and this is n't any of those things instead we get to see mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel psycho ii style are you sure you wo n't have any tea mel clannnnnnng '' now that i would watch so is this dvd what women want maybe but only the really stupid ones
i saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on hbo and was interested enough to purchase the dvd too bad i did n't watch the movie first when it was free ! james earl jone 's acting abilities were wasted on this movie and i wo n't comment on the others i 'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayed in this film sorry i ca n't be more complimentary but
the setting of this film is in the late just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be artistic '' in his craft heather graham plays his and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is 's just say endowed wahlberg 's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of wahlberg 's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes although i do n't know if the would admit as much at any rate he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his package '' this hubris leads to his as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie well it could have been but all the way through there seems to be something missing there are times the film seems '' to try and convey a message but i 'm not really sure one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i 've never cared for wahlberg he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt also i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered given the context of the film one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women that 's simply not the case in the end however the biggest problem of this movie is n't wahlberg or the lack of nudity the difficulty is that it 's just plain boring i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn and yet this flick failed to grab me
i would n't recommended this workout dvd to anyone ! there was way too much and it was very difficult to follow the three instructors i 've had this dvd for less than two weeks and sold it in a local pawn shop for 2
i used this video in the and got rid of it after a while now i am back into fitness and got the dvd based on the previous reviews when the dvd came i sat to watch it first and could not get past the cheesy chatter costumes and outdated routine it may work but home fitness has to be enjoyable and for me this was definitely not try tamilee webb 's recent stuff instead like i want that body '' and her newer cardioblast great not cheesy and very effective
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and conversely what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica kim basinger who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery 1 what is it after lots of in various parts of the bad guys round up jessica 's family while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a day spa owner cop are trying to help them mystery 2 how will the cell phone save the day mystery 3. watch for the credits at the end of the film they show up on a yep you got it
i too was mesmerized by this documentary as an educator and student of child psychology etc then i heard the running commentary especially the remarks of the cameraman and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is using despised children for selfish purposes the cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b tch his words and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls the inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm as oscar wilde noted this despicable film takes kids uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman divides families and friendships exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition like liza dolittle without hope of going either back or forward the pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling
before i start on this let me get one thing straight jackass was a good tv show for all it 's moments there were moments of genuine class and originality and i guess i know where they came from on the one hand we have johnny knoxville who has moved on from jackass to become a genuine star in hollywood going from mainstream success dukes of hazzard to critical acclaim grand theft parsons in just a couple of years a genuine talent and someone to watch in the future then we have bam margera who took his is cruel to his parents '' thing from jackass and made an entire show out of it and it quite simply the most crass unfunny and utterly utterly fake rubbish on television it 's maybe a pity bam did n't have parents who were i dunno better actors than they are because their outraged '' responses to his stunts would n't seem out of place at a sunday school play the mother is the worst offender and while bam 's stupid tagalong friends laugh in all the right places there is a genuine cruel streak and nasty side to bam that makes the whole program have a very bitter i 'd like to see what would happen if one of the yahoo 's did n't laugh or go along with everything of course this show is n't aimed at the likes of the curmudgeon it 's aimed at the dumbass kids who think avril lavigne rawwwwks and ca n't see another phony being stuffed down their easily pleased hey kids this is cool '' mtv throats a loathsome spoilt man child abusing his stupid mother and morbidly obese father you wonder why it does n't work then you remember it 's pony bam margera a guy pushing 30 who still tries to act like he 's 14. and that his mother and father are in on every single second of it another pitiful mtv product that you should steer well clear of
i wanted this movie to be good but boy was i disappointed i 've seen home movies with more acting plot and feelings parker posey should be embarrassed that she was in it save your money the one guy is kind of hot so if you 're looking for a butt shot rent it and fast forward
having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i ca n't fathom the entire plot is shallow and unrealistic i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i do n't condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it and it does n't mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you ca n't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it 's not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that would n't bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself
i get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide ! the one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself ! ! it is not matching the character
the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst josh hartnett kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline this film is directed by sofia coppola lost in translation i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of sometimes magic does not stirke twice how can all five sisters end up killing themselves their homelife was n't that unbearable a lot of parents are religious but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide kristen dunst just gets on my nerves her acting is the same in every film do n't believe the hype the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking poetic film
i was very disappointed with this product be warned this is not the movies it is only the special features of them
i searched for reviews of this movie before i saw it and did n't find any people i talked to had not seen it but had heard it was good so i finally sat down and watched it the acting was top notch it was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships one in a nursing home and one in the friendship retold by cleo threadgoode during those visits on the down side it was very feministic to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women kathy bates ' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a do n't push me '' type while much of this was funny this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground in spite of this i enjoyed the first part of the movie that is until the surprise ending while this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler the ending involved unwitting cannibalism this made me sick and i felt sick a long time after watching it had i known how sour the ending would be i never would have watched this movie
well three german punks kidnap a rich guy it does n't really matter why most of the dialogue consists of a leftist rhetoric that has n't been heard since the there are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces two of the kidnappers are male one is female of course there 's a love triangle they drink quite a bit and smoke some pot eventually they decide to let the guy go since they are n't the killing types there 's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh find something else to do with your two hours unless you want to practice listening to german
i really enjoyed goodbye lenin and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that i decided to watch this one the film follows three idealistic politically young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking selfish and uncaring bourgeois consumer society this rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses moving their furniture around and leaving notes like 'you are too wealthy ' very situationist never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into all this is fine and well but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich ignorant bourgeois pig in the first ten minutes or so i thought this might be a clever bit of directing in which we view society as seen through their eyes rather than society in its reality however this was n't to be the case the world remained bourgeois the kids are alright the older generation bourgeoise are bare cyphers and none with the exception of the man they kidnap is given anything like a personality when a goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there and take him away to a shack in the hills during this time they decide to 'educate ' him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man 's part in them the rich man barely challenges the young people at all and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong the argument running through the entire film is very i could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced but this was n't furthermore there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work the edukators are young and artistic the subtext being that because they are arty they can see things that others ca n't at one point one of the characters is on a bus when three men presumably police though its not made clear hassle a drunk for not having a ticket the character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone gives the drunk his ticket and gets off the bus do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police ca n't say that 's my experience amybe they do in germany this is a recurring problem with the film situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic the dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless by the end of the film you do n't actually know what exactly they stand for or what their solutions are to the problems of society basically the political argument hamstrings the characters development their views are never challenged so they do n't change it is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film the ending is also unbeleivably cynical and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film generally it feels like a script written by a year politics student being so utterly simplistic in it 's 'the rich are all bad ' message i would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society but at the same time i would n't recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world 's problems there has been a rash of good political films lately good night and good luck syriana the constant gardener unfortunately and given so much potential this film is not one of them shame
and not in a good way in the bs philosophy way this movie tries to delve into new activism and the circle of political life but it goes nowhere and explains nothing one could say that perhaps the theme of the movie is futility ok fair enough but maybe rearranging furniture is not the best course of action for political and social revolution just a thought stay away unless you are majoring in liberal arts
i bought this dvd for my collection i do not buy full screen format dvds amazon described the dvd as anamorphic color dolby full screen widescreen ntsc '' with an aspect ration of however when it arrived it was full screen only with an aspect ratio of consequently i returned it my recommendation if you only want widescreen do n't believe the description that this dvd is and do n't buy it
julia roberts plays ed harris ' young new wife susan sarandon plays harris ' does not like new wife new wife does not like 's cutsey but bratty kids make new wife 's life a living hell thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo new wife thinks is a nagging battle axe new wife and fight and yell at each other ad nauseum how does the film solve this conflict is diagnosed with terminal cancer everyone reconciles and new wife suddenly love each other the end this is one of the most cliched saccharine hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by hollywood in the past decade if you like julia roberts susan sarandon or ed harris please see erin brokovich dead man walking and the right stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe
do n't look here for a horror movie my friends because you wo n't find it oh house '' starts off well enough and the old lady 's suicide creates an ominous tone and just when you think it might be a scary movie it turns into a joke what you essentially have in the movie house '' is a dark comedy bordering on just downright comedy there is pretty much zero horror in this flick and when the villain is actually revealed to the audience you just have to laugh out loud because it is meant to be funny if you like dark humor with just a taste of horror then this is really right up your alley if you want a pure horror movie that will produce genuine scares forget it because you wo n't get it with this movie incidentally and yet very sadly this movie produced a pathetic sequel called house ii '' that is just plain crass stupid and mindless humor it is so bad that i will not even write a review on that garbage
this is one of those films that makes me think it must be impossible for anyone to make a truly great film the back cover makes it sound like a for anyone going through a tough time in their lives and wanting a shoulder to lean on and it seems all the critics concur that that 's not an inacurate description yet when i tried watching this film i could n't stand it ! the whole thing was a jumbled mess it kept going back and forth between things that i just did n't care about tedious boring things and i think it focused too much on the criminals involved in the story making them sound sympathetic or whatever when the film was about a cop who was overcome by grief supposedly or something like that at the death of his partner who was viciously killed by a criminal a story like this should n't spend petty time detailing the exploits trials and tribulations and whatnot of why the vicious killer kills people and does whatever else and all whatever and when the writer was n't focusing on the goodfornothing criminals it focused on a bunch of pathetic backstory the kind that makes teenagers cringe at the thought of reading a book too much character development '' and then i saw a truly breathtaking film titled batman returns 1992 and was blown away by its depiction of heartbreak combined with stunning visuals and everyone else is like oh who cares '' i truly hate this film and i hate the society that lets people make such mediocre crap and then acts like its their civil duty to put up with it as in watch it and then say they liked it and no not all my favorite films are flix i also liked 1999 's bringing out the dead as well as 1976 's taxi driver and i even enjoy the occasional little movie '' there 's too many to mention but i 'll start with the last one i saw that i enjoyed the wild dogs by the director of the hanging garden another film i hated ok that 's all i have to say about this film
it is a shame that american film classics like l and h get more attention and love outside of the us than in it i just bought the universal laurel and hardy 21 volume box set which is only available in europe from amazon uk region 2 this set is everything people are saying it is it is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films some solo efferts and goes though the hal roach features all the prints are restored and of pristine quality a truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys there are some missing films i assume for copyright reasons such as babes in toyland the devils brother bonnie scotland and flying deuces to acomadate these dvds i bought a region free dvd player off amazon which is the only way to go if you really want to collect the dvd player was very cheap plays beautfully and is well worth the investment as a side note if you have a region free player all the dvds in the universal box set are also availble as single dics in case you do n't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films if you love laurel and hardy this is the only way to go ! anything to screw hallmark and the corperate monster ! ! why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute prints ! ! !
way out west '' is my favorite stan ollie film it is consistantly clever the horse on the balcony the head under the pail the bodies in the piano and of course the delightful dance sequence alas i sold my really fine vhs version expecting someone to eventually give justice to this fun romp when do you think someone even criterion will wake up and realize that quality entertainment can not be compromised and a loving public will not settle for mediocrity
i just saw part of this dvd i have no reason to buy it since i have the universal box set a pal of mine has one of those little players with a small screen you would think that seeing this disc on such a tiny screen would hide any defects wrong ! hallmark has yet again shown nothing but contempt for what is quite possibly it 's greatest artistic asset the laurel hardy sound films from hal roach proper restorations of these films have been made and are widely available hallmark chose to use some of the poorest condition source material around i 've looked at some of the reviews on this page they cover all of the problems so i wo n't rehash them suffice to say there is no reason to buy this inferior product virtually everything in the laurel hardy catalog is out there in fine shape the only issue is format but that 's not much of an issue either you can get players for as little as 50 stan ollie are reason enough but there is plenty of other stuff out there that you can only watch if you make this small investment this release is not a dvd for watching it is a dvd for lying down and avoiding
the music is bad and so is the dancing i donated this to my public library so that people can try it for free before committing any funds to it however it is better than no exercise at all
first i did n't break a sweat and i would consider myself an intermediate in the aerobic area second the music is not music it 's someone with a synthesizer hammering out a lame '' beat i was looking good some fun and inspiring latin music and well this is not it it is sooooo cheesy this dvd be good for the very early beginner or someone who 's trying to learn english as a second language the dvd is bilingual other than that i ca n't see much use
reference picture quality on basically unwatchable though i would not recommend the blind buy on this one
great movie excellent acting ! annette benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the white house he seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist of all things and though their relationship is open and above board the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection politics are ugly but truth prevails in this optimistic movie my husband and i love this one and we have watched it many times we always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics easily one of my favorites
i was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster all 3 dvds are not compatible with the european standards and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside usa and canada i did of course not recognice this before i had given them away as a present to my parents they had for such a long time wanted these movies it was a sad moment when they put the first dvd in the dvd player so they are of course all unwrapped because i was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers i am so had to pay toll on them as well when they came to norway so if i get 3 new ones send i will have to pay toll once more then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me so what can you do to make amends i am rather angry about this rang
call me a jane austen purist but i hated this movie i did i tried to bring myself to like it but i feel as if the a e version was more closer to the time the era the clothing the language the seting etc and then the constant childish giggling this is not the lizzie i know the more i watched of the film the more i saw characters being destroyed for example bennett was just not believable to me and colins was poorly cast i just did n't like this film even i did think that mcfayden did a good job in presenting darcy but i do n't know this film just did not do it for me i feel as if jane austen would be rolling in her grave if she saw this version i do i dont know how else to describe my disapointment
we were very disappointed it seems that a considerable amount was left out whar happened the tv series included considerable more than was in that set of dvd 's we saw them a couple of weeks ago and are still quite angry !
i ca n't recommend watching this movie maybe if you like the pain and have never seen some of the older movies that now famous stars have done it 's really no that entertaining believe me
okay this is a really bad movie that said there are some moments here that are so bad that they 're funny the fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving sandra bullock is outright hilarious and very embarassing how she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery but the acting in that scene is ridiculous as well however it is certainly memorable sandra bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film but her role is essentially a throw away part then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor steve buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in his character never returns to the story after that by the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues the acting is bad the budget is obviously low and the script which invokes the occasional giggle is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel avoid this film
there are a lot of questions in this world that remain unanswered such as why are we here is there life after death and why the hell is n't ric flair dead yet ! ric flair completely stole his gimmick from the original nature boy '' buddy rogers and he is a routine wrestler if i ever saw one all of his matches contain exactly the same routine which consists of a chop being thrown from the top rope low blow ball grabbing bleeding and the figure lock also man is this guy slow he 's so slow he makes oscar night look relatively short i ca n't believe this senile old fool actually believes he is the greatest wrestler of all time i would actually put him in second place on the all time list with everybody else at number one and triple h at number three the only reason he is n't washed up and lying in the gutter with all the other wcw retards is that he 's kissing some much ass backstage at the wwe ric flair is a world champion but even viscera could of won 16 world championships if he had bookers for friends is it me or is anyone else sick of seeing his saggy man breasts on television please someone buy the man a sports bra i am praying for the day that someone takes this old fool out to the barn and puts him down because i am sick and tired of seeing this limousine riding jet flying piece of crap ! by the way i was really disappointed with this dvd and i would n't recommend it to anyone with a pulse
what do we do when first started watching wrestling in my early teens ric flair was a hero of mine he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever so when this dvd came out i got it immediately hoping to relive my youth but i realized something all the matches are the same there long and dull the same moves are done over and over and the matches only pick up when flair opponent takes the advantage there is nothing wrong with long matches if that are done well like the iron man match between bret hart and shawn michaels but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long so it can show flairs endurance i also noticed flair is so repetitive all wrestler use trademark moves but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life for example chop woo flair flop figure four cheat that not a description of one flair match that 's every flair match when i started watching wrestling i only saw his wwf matches so it all looked new to me when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are other wrestler have put together dvd which shows a variety of different matches such as eddie guerrero chris benito bret hart shawn michaels all top wrestler adopt to there opponents flair expects his opponents to adopt to him that 's way all his matches are the same the only thing worst then his dvd is his book i lost all respect for flair after a read his book it seem that he is just like hhh and shawn michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face put does it behind their backs he bashes mick foley for being a stunt man who only does gimmick matches so what 's hhh a guy flair calls great can anyone name a good hhh match that is n't a gimmick match wm against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight he says foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles he critises bret hart for not putting over shawn michaels at survivors series 97 when he was called upon to job to lex luger before he left who the wwf he refused and took the title with him to wwf brining the wcw to its knees after watching this dvd reading his book and seeing how his using backstage politics at the wwe now to keep himself in the limelight its fair to say the ric flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way i could have won 16 world title if i had my friends booking the show
i may have once considered this movie to be somehow romantic like so many other reviewers but that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that i thought were happy and stable however after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter now i have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost i was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters can they ever really be content with their spouses it 's a sad reflection on the human condition yes bitter sweet indeed
some stories date really badly and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a pov and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn but the writing and directing cant be compensated for
not a bad movie not a great movie ellen brustyn was great
it seems to me like somehow hollywood manages to glorify nearly every abberant human condition such as alcoholism barfly cocktail drug abuse blow and a host of other subjects this movie glorifies adultery as alan alda and ellen who is not burstin ' with anything spend one weekend a year having sex with each other one has to begin to wonder just how much these two need each other as they seem to manage quite well apart for the other 363 days of the year this is a pitiful and very tedious and sad excuse for a movi
the first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus this is not an original plotline but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her take that for what its worth there was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie but then the second movie is not worth it at all it was a b movie which is why it went straight to video if your a frustrated teen boy you will love this movie for its sexual content otherwise it is greatly overacted and over dramatic
i bought this for my dad 's birthday he is a fisherman this movie is one of the worst i 've ever seen not entertaining not funny not interesting not even a fishing movie i bought it based on several reviews i read this is the first time i 've been led astray on amazon the 5 stars '' rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy
this is the second remake of the original french version from around 1970. this one is the worst of the three the gags remind me of the three stooges movies they are overdone and drawn out to pad the movie to 90 minutes
it 's been about 7 or so years as far as i can remember since i last saw south park and i have to say i just remember it being more funny this movie was unbearably lame on the tv shows there are actually some witty lines i just sat through this movie listening to stupid songs that were n't even funny just the shock value '' of watching cartoons curse the curses were n't even funny either just sort of stupid 'baby talk ' type profanity what is an uncle f '' anyways i have to conclude that stone and parker are two of the most overrated guys out there team america world police just sort of drifted around with again the novelty of puppets cursing and while i rented this film hoping to just have some stupid fun like i did years ago watching south park on tv it was a real disappointment who cares about the cursing that 's not what put me off it was just not funny
i did n't switch of after 3 minutes because i thought the film was trying to be deliberately bad as a precursor for the better bits to come i switched off after 7
there were some excellent hilarious moments in this film but as a whole it was not good the profaneness was forced '' and it was obvious at times it added humor but most of the time it made it stupid the whole saddam and satan thing was just stupid and more geared towards a 14 year old than the usual ironic adult humor this show is good for save this 81 minutes of your life or better yet watch some of the former tv episodes many of those are great !
i love bad cheesy movies see 'the stuff ' but this has got to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen mind you i make it through the whole thing so i guess something made me keep watching maybe it was hope that it would get better
the three stories are quite uneven being the wan kar wai 's segment the most interesting well acted well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line however the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep the steven soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens the antonioni piece is the most disappointing one not only for being the worst but for being anyonioni 's it 's absolutely pointless and confusing in many instances it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student it 's a pity it 's antonioni 's since his reputation deserves more than this only for the wan kar wai piece i give this movie 2 stars
i 'm not going to write too much if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here from all the 3 episodes only the first one by is worth your time the hand '' is well done and typical beautifully shot by his usual contributor christopher doyle it 's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch gong li always very elegant give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story well crafted but very predictable the director lately seems to be referencing himself which is halfway form self parody equilibrium '' is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots is a simple and boring exchange between downey playing an adman and his analyst played by arkin but the worst by far is the antonioni 's episode is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment the once great director should have just retired by now he was 91 in 2004 and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces
peyton place was a fine movie so naturally they did a sequel none of the stars of the original returned they must have known the carol lynley once again proves that the only good thing in this is mary astor and they cut her part a lot stick with the original
risen from the dead of 1998 direct to dvd hell the cast of katie holmes nick stahl steve railsback bruce greenwood and william sadler make an entrance here in this bit part movie that copies the faculty '' without trying to be very different drug themes school themes monster themes bullies as football players it is all the same no cgi or special effects this is acting driven but off the cliff its sudden appearance in 1998 as a shelf space filler does not do it any more credit now watch another film with these fine actors in it certainly the the faculty '' instead or even william sadler in demon knight ''
omifg ! this was one of the worst movies ever made ! me and my cousin watched it last night and were crackinig up the script is hilarious ! who actually talks like that ! we watched it for a half hour only because we wanted to see if it would get any better uhhh sadly no we watched american beauty '' instead i really loved james marsden in gossip '' was an excellent movie but the only thing 'disturbing ' about this was the writing like james l also liked his weird friend in wasted '' but not at all in this i love katie holmes but even she could n't help this project talk about a waste of film money and time
this was an awful movie the premise was an obvious rip off an outer limits episode straight and narrow but i was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a format i was sadly disappointed the film eliminated everything that was interesting about the outer limits episode and instead filled itself with nothing in the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the bad guys '' about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect by the time the credits rolled i was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea when properly executed and i do n't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers to sum up do n't watch this movie it 's bad watch the 1990 's outer limits episode straight and narrow '' starring ryan philippe instead
i give this 2.5 stars and that 's mostly because 1. the that ties together the whys '' of dracula is interesting and 2. gerard butler has amazing screen presence the story baddies go to steal a hidden treasure thinking valuable item this item has been encased and entombed by van helsing yeah that van helsing the guardian of this particular treasure as you can guess it 's not jewels or the holy grail it does have to do with blood dracula baddies get dracula who has some kind of psychic connection to van helsing 's daughter mary estranged from papa and living in new orleans goes seeking the woman of his dreams nothing really interesting or spooky happens yes folks get bitten yes some get killed yes nice guy goes to save mary from a toothy fate sirens do their thing to nice guy hero dracula has showdown with mary and well not giving the ending away ultimately we get a new to me anyway spin on the tale when we find out how dracula was created and why silver and sunlight and crucifixes and holy water are feared and hated objects to vampiredom it 's a somewhat elegant answer but it ca n't satisfy for a lackluster preamble to the revelation justine waddell does n't do much with her role christopher plummer is rather wasted jonny lee miller has a few cute lines but is kind of disposable if likable omar epps didnt ' get a chance to do anything worth watching he 's much better on house where he gets some real characterization and infinitely better dialogue so there 's really only one reason to watch this film gerard butler now putting aside for the moment that it 's truly bizarre to have dracula speak in a scottish accent fetching but odd one can overcome this oddity by the sheer personal magnetism of the man he makes clunky lines shine through overwhelming emotive power some real acting chops and the physical presence to carry off the role oh if they 'd only put better lines into his mouth and not just sharp canines ! only at the end does he really get to speak and emote and burn it 's lovely to watch for however briefly a genuinely excellent choice for dracula except that scottish accent weird if you 're a butlerian crushgirl by all means rent or buy this the moments with butler are worth the price when he sniffs mary it 's the kind of erotic moment that puts all the nude scenes in cinema to shame and it proves that when you have people with intensity and charisma and screen itness '' an expression a breathy phrase these are more sensual than a million displays of nakedness and groaning if you 're not a fan or a serious jonny lee or plummer or whomever else in the film fan skip it it 's just not very good all it 's got in the end is the cool historical twist and gerry butler for some of you that may be enough mir
gary grant 's mother did not look a bit like his mother more like his wife the age difference simply ! a terrible cast the other problem was the attitude the mother towards his son she simply despised him but in fact her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society i just do n't know why the mother role was so cynical to her son some of the plot twists in this movie also looked very pretentious the genre also losing grip could hardly determined itself either a thriller or a comedy so many scenes simply looked too staged and too phony the absurdity of the screenplay was to be imposed as normal in a common sense but of course if the viewers could lose themselves from the logic anything was possible and acceptable in that era most of the popular movies were all like this one mixed with romance suspensful twists of the scenario actions thugs beautiful and mysterious women almsot romantic theme music sound effect synchronized with all the movements and reactions with the actors and every part of the stories we 've watched this movie couple of times before but this time after watched it developed into ridiculous and pretentious scene after scene we just hit the reject button and put it back into the plastic box you do n't have to agree with me because this is just my personal viewing after thought
this program is evil it is easy to get sucked into watching gantz because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters who have all died find themselves in they have gone to purgatory and purgatory is like an video game one feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries the art direction is decent visually it does n't look cheap the english voice acting is embarassingly bad especially the main character but not as bad as the dialogue internal and vocalized that this character has been given to speak the worst thing about this series apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners is the action '' scenes these inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow after you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video if you do n't feel like banging your head against the wall you are made of stronger stuff than this first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers and more frustration than satisfaction save yourself the pain
really people 5 stars while the plot of gantz seems like it would make a great series what was achieved in two seasons could have been done in two dvds i kept wanting to yell at the tv get on with it ! '' i wanted to know more about the characters and i wanted to see how they would overcome this strange situation they were thrust into and i wanted to see more monsters but alas all i got was dbz feeling fights going on for many episodes and endlessly whining characters the art in gantz is beautiful the concept is so cool the characters are rich and feeling it just takes too long to get to the point and then leaves you empty with a confusing ending and bad plot holes definatly not 5 stars
the episodes are great ! and so it is disappointing as censored that wb do n't put the episodes out in the right order which have the consequence of messing up a story arc it takes so little research to put the episodes in the right order and it means so much to fans of the series that it is unforgivable hence my one star i just ca n't believe it can happen i thought wb was a giant cooperation with concerns about their image instead it seems that wb are as infantile as bugs bunny whom i personally outgrew at the age of 3 seconds if i give wb too less credit then they must have done the of episodes on purpose making it more rational for people in the near future to buy this product again in high def without the so what are you wb babys or evil masterminds i 'm sorry to create a bad atmosphere when people looking at this title probably just want to read some positive comments to get excited when looking forward to buying it i do when browsing products but i believe it is even more dissapointing to discover the episode on the dvds unwarned and i just had to get my dissapointment of wb out in the world
let me say that i love love ! ! ! ! the jlu seasons and i was very excited when i found out that these episodes were coming to dvd to my great disappointment i found that disc 3 the one with aquaman on the cover of the disc would not play in any of my dvd players including my computer dvd player i returned the item to amazon and amazon replaced it in a flash again disc 3 would not play in my computer dvd player and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the dvd into my standard dvd player to even start the disc i returned sadly the item again to amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this dvd edition so sadly my wait continues beware i can understand a problem with one disc from one order but to experience the same problem with the same disc from two different orders that to me spells defective disc for all anyone else out there have a problem with disc 3 not playing
i guess success turned around for sam raimi in 2002 2004 with the two films but first he created this v '' like character in this garage of a movie i liked v for vendetta '' but not this darkman '' if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see v for vendetta '' do n't see darkman
i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i can not compare the character to other sources therefore coming from someone that did not know '' darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment ! there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies like the shadow batman etc which is interesting nevertheless darkman was quite a disappointment considering the of the cast liam neeson larry drake and frances mcdormand among others it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement in an effort to exact revenge he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his in short the acting and the plot are average nothing great while the dialogues are way below average the movie falls into the type of category the characters are overall bland and just plain uninteresting rick anderson played by the fool '' ted raimi from the xena series though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really in a nutshell it 's not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening 's entertainment and that 's about it no masterpiece here 2 stars
jeez maybe i am getting old but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest a brilliant scientist disfigured angry finds temporary techie fix for face goes to get bad guys fighting more fighting still more fighting ex mate learns he 's alive he leaves her anyway he 's too ugly the end more to come if successful not recommended
i would n't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that i had to when i saw what christiane schmidt had to say now we all know mr gibson has got issues with the british as well as others just look at that other pile of tosh braveheart but here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous the usual response is it 's not history but hollywood it 's fiction based on historical events '' but the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that ! now i 'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war but i 've never read of the british burning down churches with people inside nazis yes no but who cares about whether it really happened 's only a film ! ! good grief next thing you know they 'll be making a film about the us recovering the first enigma machine
in the worlds time of crisis you have to show your true colors ! ! ! ! ! go to hell ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i loved the early episodes equally intelligent humane cynical sardonic and just right out hilarious they were some of the best television ever produced unfortunately the show moved away from this formula which worked amazingly well to the latter day formula the show became overly preachy annoying incredibly sanctimonious politically correct badly acted badly written pretentious and downright silly at times the show ran for 11 seasons and with all sitcoms that run too long it quickly ran out of juice but that does n't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards hawkeye and bj 's characters became incredibly annoying especially hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses it was funny early on but as he aged it became more and more childish alda 's acting is way over the top in these later seasons since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes i suppose no one told him to tone it down charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here and the one i like the most you 're not supposed to like him because of his blue blood '' upbringing but you do anyway because hawkeye and bj are so damn irritating you would think that bj and hawkeye would n't be so naive sometimes about things considering they 've been in a war now for years soldiers are very jaded cynical people and with good reason they do n't get more naive as time progresses the early episodes had hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones and it should be the other way around watch the first 3 seasons except when henry gets killed which was just done for cheap shock value those were the best
let me just start by saying that i do n't own the chosen collection '' but that i do own the original releases of all seven seasons why review this then quite frankly i believe the combined sets to be a waste of money i have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this they are as flimsy as this set is and just as breakable the set 's discs appear the same as the previous editions probably a rehash from leftover sets a bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor but since i do n't own it i haver never seen it i spent my money on buffy the vampire slayer '' once and once is enough for me buffy is a endearing series but why throw away dvd sets just to have them return '' from the garbage
one of the most laughably bad most overwrought ridunculous movies ever if this is terrifyingly real '' then showgirls was a documentary good lord what a
atrocious compilation it 's of some of the worst films the coens ' did excluding the big lebowksi and does not include their most famous films what were they thinking it 's like if they released a spielberg compilation but only included catch me if you can ai minority report and war of the worlds wtf ! ! ! ! plus you can buy each dvd separately and come under the asking price of the entire set the big lebowski and the man who was n't there are about 10 bucks new in most stores blood simple and int cruelty which is the most uncoen film ever are closer to 5 in many places i 've seen so do n't fall into the compilation trap '' because you are not getting a bulk '' discount just buy the films you want separately most coen dvds are very reasonable price wise any coen compilation without fargo barton fink and raising arizona is worthless and again you 're better off spending 40 on those dvds individually
the dvds we received were not formatted to zone 4 australia se we 've had to return the goods unfortunately therefore no helpful comments
i think maybe i saw the preview for this on another platinum series dvd and it looked funny so i bought it because i wasnt real familiar with alex thomas i had just seen him on a couple shows but it wasnt funny not at all it couldnt end soon enough at first i was thinking it would get funny then i just wanted to take it out not funny shoulda rented it and not bought i
a very cheap quick ripoff of a commercial success of gremlins the kid below me is to stupid to know what good films are take the pacifier out of your mouth and change your diapers mommas boy
i remember seeing this film as a kid and thinking to myself maybe when i 'm older i 'll understand the signifigance of this movie but 29 years later i 'm even more confused as to why this film was made king of marvin gardens '' took me a four sittings to watch because i kept falling asleep do n't get me wrong i appreciate a thoughtful human interest story but where was the human interest in this flick why am i supposed to be interested in these characters interesting characters do n't have to be nice and heroic but they certainly have to be compelling ! i think after the tremendous success of five easy pieces '' deservedly so that genre of must have been all the vogue in cinema during the with the exception of the last 10 minutes you have an absolutely flatliner of a film here movies of that period like fat city '' and scarecrow '' do a much more effective job of conveying the dire banality of real life although the packaging and presentation for the king of marvin garden '' dvd was flawless
dont buy it not enough action but rent i
lots of fun for the little ones however the 'nose ' part is not fun at all because some of these cute kids need a good nose cleaning i wonder how much time was put into creating this dvd and and on the kids ' cleanliness
i like sissy and marissa but holy cow this movie moved at a snails pace i almost fell asleep waiting for the gun shot the story is so typical girl with two kids looking for some sap to help her out so she picks a naive high school grad pulls some smooth sex moves on the poor kid and gets his all in a whirl and he becomes king kong and wants to protect her from her horrible '' estranged hubby and play daddy to her brats its a no win situation legally he 's an adult '' so mom and dad ca n't forbid him from diddling with the tramp and unfortunatly he 's in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets killed for no good reason and she ends up going back to her estranged hubbby and thinks what he did to get her back was soooo romantic the world is full of dumb c ts and even dumber men do n't bother with this one
this film should have lasted about twenty five minutes the only real action that occured in the movie would probably play out at about that length i am no action movie junkie but in the bedroom left me desperate for the credits to roll up just so i could see something move it is a film filled with talent from the cast to the crew but despite that it loses itself in mood while i did feel the angst that the characters felt in this film it simply went on too long silent anesthetized and gruesomely meticulous the film had no heartbeat there was no effort to invest the viewer in time it became nothing more than annoying i stopped sympathizing with the characters and started desperately desiring a finale it was n't a terrible film but it was a disappointment all the awards it was nominated for had me expecting something much more powerful and significant it left me merely drained
with all due respect to the director of adventures in babysitting chris colombus he helped create one of the most racist films in american cinematic history is it well crafted yes is the acting okay yes does it move along heck just like a windup toy but please consider the plot a white girl elizabeth shue lightyears from her work in leaving las vegas is several white kids when she gets a desperate phone call from her white girl friend why is her white girl friend desperate because she is stuck in a downtown bus station surrounded by gasp african americans ! naturally shue races off kids in tow to rescue her friend from this tragic situation maybe she should have called jesse jackson first eh when shue gets downtown various amusing adventures ensue but how can it be ignored that each of the adventures involves meeting someone who lives in the inner city who is african american and every single african american she meets is a criminal there is only one exception are you ready 'spoiler ' ahead ! the african americans who sing and dance ! colombus must have been very disappointed that steppin fetchit who adopted that stage name as a joke was not alive and could not appear in his film there is one african american who helps shue and who does not sing and dance spoiler ahead i kept hoping he would turn out to be an undercover cop but no he was a car thief it would appear that colombus is not aware of any african americans who are not thieves thugs or crooks the film is a disgrace really the fact that it is well produced makes it even worse it can not be written off as a cheapy done by people who did not know better for anyone who has seen colombus ' other films however the racism of this film should come as no surprise home alone '' was set in a similarly all white world there was a single african american with a speaking part of a few lines and no other cast members even in rowling 's harry potter series which devoted a great amount of time to racism issues between 'muggles ' and magic practitioners a brilliant symbolic foray into racism by rowling colombus managed to dilute her message look at the first two harry potter films which he directed england in colombus ' hands becomes an almost entirely all white country only after colombus leaves the series do actors get a chance this film should not be praised it should be held up as an example of cultural bias and racism i generally do not write negative reviews but this film has been given a 'free ride ' for way too long by american film critics but they are the same critics who praise 'gone with the wind ' a four hour film about the civil war which does not once mention the word 'slave ' the racism of 'gone with the wind ' has been ignored by most reviewers it took a long time for me to realize how racist it was when i first saw it as a kid i thought scarlett o'hara must have been a wonderful employer ! i assumed that scarlett must have had a wonderful dental plan for her african american employees to keep them so loyal !
i bought this dvd based on the 87 good reviews there was a rating but i thought it was an odd data point i forgot what my hs history teacher told us frenchmen can be wrong frankly those who thought it was a must have all their taste in their mouths i also question their sense of humor there 's not much that 's funny about this film still if you are dying to watch a movie and it 's the only thing on tv go for it but do n't waste your money buying it ps some of the language is a bit hard for a rating i do n't advise watching it with kids pps the poster artists ' immagination never ceases to amaze me there is nothing in the movie that even comes close to the picture on the cover
skateboarding could really do without self conscious myth making like this one part that really got me mad was the film maker saying these guys were making history every single day ! '' or something to that effect who are the egotistical ones the filmakers there to get rich and famous or the skaters who made their own decks and skated curbs in the rain for the enjoyment of it i eventually flicked channels half way through the movie after a piece of dubious editing stuff like this gets in the way of skateboarding
two or three skateboarders become famous performing tricks like trained seals while two or three thousand skateboarders turn to drugs and alcohol to combat their depression of not accomplishing a damn thing in life this movie glorifies individuals whose only contribution in life is standing on top of a piece of wood with wheels wow they are so radical and cool i just wan na quit work get myself a piece of wood with wheels and spend the rest of my adult life in venice beach somewhere gliding up and down the boardwalk looking for that big break like an ankle or arm or hip or if i 'm really lucky my neck surf 's up dude
of about 50 minutes i 'll never get back the movie is 93 minutes but around minute 53 i decided i was so bored and did n't care what happened like another review i agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive not quirky or interesting they 're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that and did i mention it was boring so mind numbingly boring there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what i assume this movie was attempting i ca n't be bothered to think of examples because i 'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this
if jennifer aniston 's friend '' rachel greene ever had a weird dream i could imagine it to be just like this changed variation of the graduate '' but just like rachel i 'd probably shake it off as a weird time spent in the twilight zone the good girl '' would have believe that somewhere in red state aniston is a frustrated 30 year old sales clerk in a mythical '' store called the retail rodeo '' her name pun intended justine last as we can deduce from aniston 's off screen monologue which she reads in a forest '' kid of sound she feels trapped just like all the seemingly robots around her married to a dim bulb of a husband the wonderful john reilly last yearns to be rescued and believes she 's finds her shining knight in the person of an introverted but passionate younger man named holden worther jake gyllenhaal the sex is great of course and before last can bask in her newfound sense of intimatacy and hope for a better life she must contend with a major holden is a lovesick loon from there on director miguel arteta and writer mike white turn the tables on our own expectations for finding love in odd places no last minute romantic rescues here for the good girl '' is ultimately a cynical extramarital version of a simple plan '' where one misdeed leads to another it 's game for part of the way but the movie ultimately is phoney another condescinding hollywood take on life in land as a fate worse than death all the characters are made to go a beat slower and drag around their surroundings like zombies from the movie dawn of the dead '' further proof of the filmakers blue state status are depicted by haveing gyllenhaal 's parents act like the subjects in the painting american gothic '' they 're two silent moronic centurians aniston is just too sitcom spunky and for the heroine her homestyle accent comes and goes while gyllenhaal 's hair looks as if it was styled somewhere on rodeo drive the movie 's one bright spot is zooey deschanel as aniston 's morose a funny riff she repeated in the movie failure to launch '' wake up rachel wake up
the good girl is a horror of a film it imagines itself as an ode to the everyman trapped in a humdrum existence what it becomes on film is an insulting example of hollywood filmmaking at its worst i use the word insulting because that is what i felt as i watched this movie aniston nelson gyllenhaal all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a forrest gump '' imitation gyllenhaal and aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk the way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog it 's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying the film itself is grey and dull the other characters in the film flat and stereotypical the coworker who invites her to bible study overall this movie is n't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to dvd in another era it probably would have never made it to the screen oh how i miss that era
this is a movie that starts out nowhere and for 95 minutes takes you further than any nowhere you ever dreamed of unimaginative lacking in humor and a senseless plot the good girl is definitely a movie for anyone who loves other bad nonsensical current movies like crash jennifer aniston plays a new version of rachel and the writing is just awful the only good thing about this movie is zooey deschanel but then zooey can sparkle like a diamond in any old trash heep
aniston is just about ok but manages to leave an impression of sorts ! however the downside was that she kind of brought the friends '' method of acting in this movie too ! also the movie does not really explain some of aniston 's actions such as why she told the store manager about jake 's whereabouts ! sort of a movie ! not a well polished product !
i bought this film after being fascinated with what the bleep do we know the problem with this one is that tiller assumes his audience has a background in am showing my own ignornance in giving it one star but i could n't follow the dang thing even though i knew the information was true and vital if you 're a dummy like me stick with bleep '' schlatte
i 'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from hopkins and thompson this has got to be one of the most boring movies i 've ever tried to sit through do n't be fooled by artsy film snobs this one is a snoozer and oh by the way the tenacious loyalty devotion and integrity '' of hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film is in my opinion distracting and ridiculous
the only good thing in this movie was howard 's performance she is innocent and believable i ca n't understand how good actors like weaver hurt and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this the 'plain ' dialogue among the 'elders ' is painfully numbing choppy and stilted and the directing drove me crazy especially since night insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through or following them without ever bothering with these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera if you like the back of william hurt 's head you 'll get plenty of it in this film the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague which is too bad since when he finally has a good speech we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes i agree with others i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode rent it first before you buy and save some money for a classic thriller like psycho
this movie is the most boring uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever wasted my money on the plot is stupid the characters are dull and insipid and the whole movie leaves you asking as the credits run so what '' do n't waste your money !
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
i knew the ending within the first 10 minutes night shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at denny's
roger ebert a review i greatly respect and normally agree with raved about this flick roger i love you but you missed the boat on this one i 'm not going to review the plot because it 's been done by several reviewers already suffice it to say david lynch did n't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman english okay class who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig 's head on page 72 in lord of the flies david how about you '' and now want to inflict it on you the unwitting movie watching public thanks lynch but i 'll pass i did n't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of crime and punishment and i did n't enjoy it in scene after scene of mulholland drive to add insult to injury lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense rationalizing it by saying life often does n't make sense this habit of his is less noticible in this film than say twin peaks mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless yeah it 's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life but more along the lines of i would 've won powerball this week except i spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the renfaire what the heck was i thinking '' or i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie what the heck was i thinking '' but i 've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf i must live a sheltered life or something lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his dvd believing his movie must be watched in its entirety or not at all i 'd advise the second to be fair in this case i do n't think he 's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance but rather by the knowledge that every male if given the chance would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action c'mon all you 5 star givers admit it ! you find the movie pretentious and silly but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy ! to reiterate if i wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence i 'll rewatch dallas if i wanted to see a nice rack i 'll take my top off and look in the mirror who needs mulholland drive
you 're kidding right the only good film in the trilogy is the origonal how dare you try to continue the story of something that can not be continued the orgional was good enough leave it there just because you want money do n't ruin such wonderfull entertainment i did n't even stay awake through all of the movie it was so bad ! i 'd rather watch barney with my
director turi meyer cast tony todd donna d'errico alexia robinson jsu garcia mark lupe ontiveros elizabeth guber rena riffel ernie hudson running time 93 minutes rated r for bloody violence and gore sexuality and language the third in the series derived from a concept by clive barker day of the dead '' they ca n't even come up with their own subtitle staggers down the path already navigated by the halloween '' and nightmare on elm street '' movies that is taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet the original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine this one is just a load of rubbish donna d'errico from baywatch what a spectacle of credibility stars as caroline mckeever the great great granddaughter of the feared candyman tony todd once again once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest as the candyman hacks his way through various bad actors caroline teams up with new pal david nick corri to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the candyman while he was still alive which may hold the key to stopping him there 's not a single thing here that is n't scavenged from the first candyman '' film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days the screenplay is so lazy it ca n't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot the photography is bright and glossy which is at odds with what 's supposed to be a dark story while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all anyone could have directed this movie so little effort has been put in to make it scary while the ending is an outrageous cop out no thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having d'errico running around in a variety of tight vests the rest of the performances are poor too although none are quite as bad as d'errico 's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically surely more can be done with characters like the candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone 's stomach the fact that the makers of this movie think candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just ca n't be bothered even to try something a bit different clive barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be but he 's right about one thing the sequels to his movies are garbage
clive barker did a good job on the original candyman it was truly a cut above most horror movies the second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous there is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable donna d'errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks lets hope this is the last sequel
i will not give candyman 3 day of the dead '' a serious analysis because it is so stupid and to be frank is not even worthy of a review other than to say that this trash sucks just like the rest of the series but also this movie goes above beyond being horrible and is the epitome of the word lame '' this movie f '' ing sucks ! ! ! please pardon me for my language but after watching this movie i am sure you can understand my distress after wasting my time on this complete and utter rubbish
the saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series i can remember the first time i watched the original created by clive barker i luv 'd it the same ca n't be said for this film caroline is last living descendent of the candyman and he wants to end it all by ending her all who watch this film and the acting of donna d ' errico will wish for the same thing one would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of baywatch for the film and for that reason only or maybe it 's because a little fragile thing like her ca n't take on candyman head on get a real actress like kathy bates in there and she 'll kick his ass misery is a classic as far as tony todd is concerned he does a good job in this film but not as scary as he has been in the other films he does a good job none the less and serves as a as far as the script goes it 's a decent attempt at the franchise al septien director turi meyer do what they can but that does n't save the film from being less then average side performances from the art gallery owner the two bad cops and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little there is n't much to the story caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her people she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it and she tries to stop him that 's it nothing more to it over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable
if havoc '' was anne hathaway 's all '' vehicle she needs to check the engine hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as bijou phillips and joseph in this drivel hathaway and her friends the plc '' as they call themselves are products of palisades in california bored with their seemingly bland lives they adopt the gangsta '' mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize in truth they 're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable posers we 've all encountered this type before you see them at the mall wearing the most expensive rocca '' wear and and fubu '' even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing they think that they have no identity of their own so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be in this tale hathaway 's group has a with a latino gang drawn to these outlaws hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an party hathaway then returns with one of her friends bijou phillips and the two take the downward spiral into supposed gang life in the end however something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang their actions cause a number of things to occur the results of those actions are status quo for their social status although the film is pulled down by a lot of seems to have channeled jamie kennedy 's malibu 's most wanted '' character the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed latino gang headed up by freddy rodriguez first of all i 'd think that a real gang would have taken out the plc '' without flinching secondly had four innocent '' little girls actually made it into the gang 's party i 'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance instead rodriguez backs off on the posers of the plc '' and seemingly falls for hathaway 's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie havoc '' is a dud unbelievable uneventful and definitely a rental
what can i say about the truly inspired film havoc '' that has n't been said before barbara kopple an academy award winning documentarian taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture sounds like a recipe for success ! add a talented cast of appealing actors given really meaty roles awesome ! not so much '' havoc '' is unfortuanately an unmitigated disaster you wo n't believe your eyes the kids the gangs the streets of everything just rings so false the last time i saw so many posers playing '' street toughs was at my junior high auditions for grease '' and i think we could have taken these kids a lot has been made about the shocking '' sexual content of the film anyone shocked '' by this movie probably does n't see very many movies anne hathaway does appear naked which seems to be a selling point but she and everyone else deserves better i 'd actually have rated the movie about a 4 because it 's a campy mess ! ! ! if someone had realized that this was a exploitation flick and sold it as such i 'd have bought into it no though this is a serious movie '' and important '' document of our time sadly on that scale these kids need to go back to school because they failed
maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking but i doubt it since vanilla ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new i went to high school with kids like this and i 've bought the eminem cd and there 's a little more to them than the stupidity but let 's discuss the movie anne hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in east seeing her boyfriend beat down she 's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating then she goes to parties gets into even more trouble and starts losing her jerry ghetto talk the mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there 's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner but well he 's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner actually he 's coming off like a gangsta yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat yes it 's ironic that she 's trying to dress ghetto while he 's trying not very hard to dress suburban wife beater is suburban the movie 's climax is a scene in which anne and bijou ask the guys if they can join their crew '' and if the gang did n't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked they sure have it then and really who does n't know that that 's gang initiation standard started by the hell 's angels in 1965 after that disaster both anne and bijous say no but bijou takes a little more time saying no the movie unravels as anne hathaway discovers her inner white girl and her friends act even more stupid there 's a neat scene between her and bijou philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people but it 's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie the one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate dj squalls ' character from hustle flow and hustle flow in and of itself since that 's a white character in a black world that does n't fall into either extreme of wigger or doogie howser he 's just himself whereever he goes he 's someone the morons of this movie could learn from but really would n't you rather just see them all shot dead
this dvd set is just plain awful obscure episodes replete with authentic television broadcast quality avoid this purchase like the plague
i was 4 years old when this movie was released but i vividly remember irene cara 's smash song of the same name in 1980 especially the chorus of fame i 'm gon na live forever '' and after so many years i was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was i disappointed i was thoroughly bored during the first the audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes after this painful sequence the movie finally gets underway i tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and could n't do it i appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts it is hard work everybody 's an actor dancer musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it and i definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment but the movie just did n't flow for me perhaps it would have to do with the fact that i 'm not one of those people who is n't proclaiming to anyone who 'll listen that i 'm an actress '' and who rolls their eyes at those people who do besides the slow pace of the story fame '' is very dated the top that became the rage of the due to cara 's video and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that wonderful '' decade known as the gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie i do n't get the hype about this film at all donna di giacom
considering the director 's the high quality of the original movie the poseidon adventure and the budget available for making this remake i found poseidon to be an absolutely awful and uninteresting movie and a complete waste of time and money i give it 1 star because i can not go any lower than that i read the reviews before watching it so i was prepared for the worst but it was even worse than i expected let 's keep in mind we 're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here not a mere the only positive thing i have to say about it is that it is mercifully short while watching it on dvd i barely overcame the urge to certain scenes the plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver there is no introduction no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going who the people are what caused the etc calling the main characters instead of is giving them too much credit you do n't care at all whether they survive or die the only exception perhaps being the little boy the cgi effects are n't all that great either i never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged a typical and to me illogical and extremely irritating hollywood trademark the movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas the water is supposed to be cold and salt but that does n't show even for a second although they are just passengers the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well even though it is turned upside down and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape they know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself you do n't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it at the end of the movie the survivors reach daylight and lo and behold there 's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated conveniently located near the in typical hollywood tradition the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft mr petersen 's poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started a seriously uncool movie that is insulting even to people who are looking for hours of brainless entertainment
this is a great flick for people who are irritated by because there are none there is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie so it makes for excellent escapism which we all need now and then since all the characters stay together it is easy to follow along so you can turn your brain off it wo n't be needed since it 's all about the ship acting was n't necessary you can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of russell and dreyfus i felt pity for them as actors and hope they can rebound the movie is shorter than most so there will be minimum impact on your life you will remember nothing about it soon after exposure
when word that wolfgang petersen director of such fantastic films as das boot enemy mine and the perfect storm was slated to direct the remake of the poseidon adventure now shortened to simply poseidon the sizzling hype around hollywood was immediately palpable production costs for the heavily film skyrocketed to 160 million making it one of the most costly films of 2005 released in 2006 adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring josh lucas glory road kurt russell sky high richard dreyfuss holland 's opus emmy rossum the phantom of the opera 2004 freddy rodriguez lady in the water and kevin dillon 24 tv series now the poseidon adventure 1972 was n't that great a film to begin with but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by karen carpenter it 's got to be the morning after '' and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event the capsizing of a cruise ship gene hackman ernest borgnine red buttons roddy mcdowall shelly winters and jack albertson rounded out that cast and although the production was a bit cheesy by today 's standards it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice this was the focus the destruction of the ship was just the catalyst not the focal point which is where wolfgang 's remake encounters significant problems the character in poseidon is rushed never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard more film time is given to the cgi water fires explosions and other items many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship then we 're jerked back to the characters who do n't really respond to it so what was the purpose of showing the these things the simple answer is because it was cgi it was cool it cost money so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses since we 're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters ' interactions with one another when one of them dies there 's no impact for the viewer most will probably say so what '' when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive cgi water fire or explosion hollywood needs to learn that it 's the people in the film audiences care about not the totally awesome '' special effects sure can put the cgi in there and make it look nice but it has to have an impact on the characters
i love billy blanks lower body and ultimate bootcamp dvds i tried his ab bootcamp thinking it would be great too but what a letdown i 'm not sure why so many other reviewers liked it so much maybe it 's just me his favorite move is standing and rotating the torso from side to side i felt it in the abs a little but he keeps going back to it over and over and it bothered my back also he makes some comment that your neck will stop hurting if you just suck it up and strengthen the neck muscles if you are pulling on your neck and using bad form that he teaches you you can get hurt most of the video is done standing up he focuses more on the obliques sides than the rectus abdominus front at first i liked the move where you rotate your hip up and bring your elbow down isolating the obliques but i got bored of it after 10 minutes of the same thing he does crunches standing up too you stand in this hunched over squatting position which i 'm sure is bad for the back put your hands behind your head and contract your abs pulling your head down pulling on the neck i thought this was a lot of work for the rest of the body but i did n't feel it in my abs at all i prefer to do crunches on the floor which uses more resistance since you 're lifting the upper body against gravity he does have some good floor moves in there at the end that i 've never seen before it might be worth a rental to see those as usual billy shows his lack of stretching knowledge his stretching routine usually involves swinging the arms like in tai chi which really does n't stretch anything i found it weird that he does a quad stretch and a hamstring stretch at the end of an ab workout would n't you expect an ab stretch or a back stretch this video is about 30 minutes it might seem short but when you 're targeting only 1 muscle group that 's a long time i thought my abs would be twice as sore compared to another dvd i have which is 15 mins but the only thing that 's sore is my back i guess i 'll keep looking i 've heard good things about gilad 's abs workout
i am 38 and considered obese however i work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy this dvd would be great for the older generations i still need to loose 45 pounds and i am using denise austin 's burn fat fast
i think denise austin does a decent job in some of her other videos but this is n't one of them she lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she 's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot the moves are not well choreographed and very awkward some may find encouragement in the times denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says we 're burning butter yeah '' but i found it annoying i think there are much better workouts for the money out there
when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue you may as well turn it off the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash
the of this film was potentially interesting but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable one star each for cross and black whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable i would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching melvin goes to dinner
directors actors and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral it 's understandable as it 's a worthy goal 99.5 of them fail perhaps it 's a lack of education maybe it 's poor upbringing that has reinforced and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in hollywood directly leads to this end the only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles and this is not a new concept it 's typically an element of every movie it seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy this falls into the latter category i want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun
i think i 've seen almost everything bob 's been involved with and this just did n't do it for me if you have friends and they are n't complete dullards you 've probably had most of the conversations you 'll see in this movie
there was some great lines and the ending was funny still it was a movie spoofing about itself it really was n't all that good yes plenty of celebrities still so what
definatly one of the worst movies ever the dialog is so boring i had an attack trying to watch it i usally never turn a movie off in the middle but i had to do it with this one i tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it so i would never have to suffer through this again the characters are so lame i did'nt even care about who was threating his life i wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it it sucks ! ! ! ! ! and it is really dated
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of
patrick dempsey had an usual niche in the teen comedy as did the characters he played he was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end here was no acception he plays the lovable loser once again this time he was an arrogant cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college disappointed and angry at his failing grades his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place while patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor he encounters a beautiful mysterious stranger who like the plot to a bad porn movie makes his job worth while with no strings attached while this fleeting encounter might have ended there the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this and soon patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy the smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that long before desperate housewives he was their afternoon delight what was amazing to me in watching this movie is that patrick did n't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires he is simply a friend a companion someone to talk with i guess i just do n't understand why some of the women he was servicing did n't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head of course as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving that 's an urban ledgend if there ever was one i gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words still it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people
disney is a joke and this movie is a joke i wish i could give it zero stars why does disney keep instisting on taking these dark disturbing tales such as pocahontas alladin and the huntchback of notre dame which by the way is really notre dame of paris and making them into cutsey kids films and oh lets give it a happy wappy cutesy wutesy ending screw that this is a dark sad and disturbing tale and that 's the way this story should be ! what the heck story is disney going to try to adapt as a children 's film next the scarlet letter
i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents considering that it was aimed at children it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance while no stripping happened there was n't much other difference in the style of dance later in the movie one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire regardless of the rest of the movie these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one
whenever you think of disney films you typically think of cutesy 80 minute comedy musicals with pop culture jokes to appeal to adults and a sappy ending to make the kids happy but disney 's the hunchback of notre dame is quite different from that it 's surprisingly a much more darker and more serious film than disney 's usual cartoons although none of it is ever graphic there is a surprising amount of deaths for a g rated disney cartoon the movie also deals with several adult subjects like racism persucution and even religion the film is mostly serious but there are some comical moments performed by quasimodo 's gargoyle friends unfortunately as funny as the gargoyles are none of them were really all that memorable and i actually find myself having trouble remembering any of their names and while they did have their laughable moments there were also times were i felt like their presence felt intrusive especially in the later more dramatic moments of the story i did n't like how they had the gargoyles help fend off the soldiers near the end of the film either what made the gargoyles tolerable is that they were kept seperate from the rest of the real world '' of the story and were only used when quasimodo was alone as part of his imagination by having them fight the soldiers it feels like disney is trying to mesh the realisim of the story with the fantasy elements which works fine with most of their other films but feels really out of place in this more serious movie it 's like disney wants to push the g rating as much as possible but they are n't brave enough to truly make this a dark film so they had the gargoyles included to lighten things up for the kiddies perhaps if this movie was rated pg instead disney would 've been more free to explore the darker sides of this story and the gargoyles could 've been used a lot less aside from qausimodo most of the other characters feel very disney stereotypical esmeralda is your average spunky disney heroine phoebus is the typical dashing disney hero with a big head who falls in love with the heroine and frollo is scar from the lion king in human form despite a rather small cast of characters compared to disney 's other films very little development is given to any of them aside from qausimodo i could n't really connect with any of the other supporting characters because not enough time was spent developing them and it did n't help that most of their personalities are disney stereotypes the hunchback of notre dame also lacks that magical sense of wonder that other disney movies have the storyline is entertaining but you just do n't really feel drawn into it the hunchback of notre dame does have some gorgeous animation though i loved the detail designs of the churches and this film has some of disney 's most stunning animation easily rivaling any of their classics in the visuals department the background music is beautiful as well but other than out there '' and hellfire '' most of their songs are pretty forgettable and even those two noteable tunes get rather old after a while do n't get me wrong the hunchback of notre dame is far from being a bad film and i enjoyed it a lot i loved how disney attempted to show a darker side for a change qausimodo is one of their more likeable heroes and one that anybody who 's been a social outcast can easily relate to and the animation is gorgeous but the film just does n't connect to the viewer and some of the comedy scenes felt very out of place still older viewers who think they 're too grown up for disney 's more childish movies but still love animation will enjoy this film and diehard disney fans will want to add this movie into their collection but casual moviegoers should pass this up and stick to something like beauty and the beast instead and most of this film will probably be uninteresting to younger viewers due to its lack of magical fuzzy creatures and its more serious undertones
when reflections in a golden eye '' was first released theatrically the film was color tinted or filtered so that virtually everything was a golden sepia tint with the exception of objects that were red or pink such as liz taylor 's lips or a sash on her dress apparently that did n't sit well with audiences because the film was later in a regular color print just as the liz taylor film by joseph losey secret ceremony '' was ruined when they it with additional sequences and a narrative track for viewers none of the reviews or promotional material that i 've read addresses this issue the dvd release could have been an opportunity to present the film in both versions the original sepia tint and the conventional technicolor but apparently no one felt it was worth it to observe the director 's original intentions a wasted opportunity
dated derivative unintelligent this is truly bottom of the range stuff the acting directing soundtrack and script are all dire none of the characters are even remotely sympathetic in fact i was hoping they 'd die slowly and painfully i note that billy bob thornton was both star and a scriptwriter methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose an arrogant amoral misogynistic coward with zero sense of humour do n't waste your time watching this drivel it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase
i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run '' movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
this movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre far less interesting than pulp fiction and even below the level of reservoir dogs it is said that in the violent late middle ages street shows were often staged in european cities where fake blood flowed like water heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines during an evisceration delighting the crowd it seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come full circle from barbara tuchman 's gripping account of the awful fourteenth century despite the abundant gore if the film had been better handled it could have been quite good there are glimpses of its failed potential at different points for instance the scene towards the end where the prison governor 's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct copy of an actual event at the bastille during the days of the early french revolution in sum as a special kind of disgusting art form it is interesting as entertainment though natural born killers sucks i admit some people will like it no doubt the same crowd who would attend public executions if they were available for viewing
i felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer after about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so i turned it off
i was on a plane from shanghai to bangkok stop drooling and i was reading a book on the tv i saw tim allen chasing an orange cat in the course of the chase he dropped down from two legs to four the effects i 'll admit right up front were great this looked far better than the old i think version called the shaggy which i have n't seen but even so it sucks i did n't need sound or subtitles and i did n't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks true sucking is like that yeah i saw the bit with the scrabble board i am dad '' whoop dee freaking doggy doo it 's possible we underestimate tim allen 's ability as an actor perhaps because the santa clause was so unforgivably bad but even so this movie sucks sometimes life is just that simple
this movie was very disturbing to me i did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in frog with the dog head bothered do n't recommend this movie for small children as they would take it too serious there were some funny parts and tim allen played a very good role i am an animal lover and i do n't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie now i know why this movie never came to my local theatre
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is the whole cast is wasted in this movie and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better like pretty much the leads in this movies i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in but this one they might as well if your a tim allen fan please do yourself a favor and get either the santa clause movies or the toy story movies and avoid this movie at all costs here are 99 minuts of my life that i wo n't see again and i am trying to make sure that you do n't waste your time on this dud who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog in some scenes in the movie ore pretty much the whole thing i have n't seen monster house or cars but i hope that these will be 2 better movies or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this dave douglas tim allen is a lawyer that dislikes dogs and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester joshua leonard and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant strictland and he does n't much of a family life since he is never home and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie his wife is rebecca douglas kristin davis and they have 2 children josh spencer breslin and carly zena grey and he has an appoontment to josh 's pta meetings and even through he is reminded at work he forgets carly is not only a is both forrester 's student and a budding animal advocate herself and her brother is trying out for football like his dad even through he secretly hates it and did n't sign up for the fall musical and then there is a mad scientist robert downey trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery and carly even kidnaps it from grant strictland and brings him home nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas that gets him starting acting like a dog too and even looking exactly like him at times the movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old which would be impossible since neither dogs or people live that long all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes and this is one to avoid at all costs
like sardines packed in a tin 6 of lovely carole lombard 's lesser paramount efforts are crammed on to two discs so you get a nice cheap reflects how much respect no less appreciation universal has for lombard the films range from mediocre to none of them great none of them bad the prints have not been restored and look ok but this is what universal has to do when they are selling these films as a budget item do n't expect the incomparable high quality you get from warner on these releases prints they were taken from are worn out and just plain bland in life lonbard was on fire on these dvds she merely fizzles out
not a review about the films but of the quality of the so called brand new mint recieved this collection along with the other 2 glamour collections and the first thing i notice when i open the dvds is that the condition of the discs were not in the condition i would expect they were scratched all to bloody hell on the sides of the discs facing up on both discs one and two i complained to amazon they sent me new dvds and they were in the same poor condition i then purchased them at a local walmart and there was no improvement so the bottom line is that when you get a new dvd examine it under a light because as with this and all dvds there is a possibility of it going out of print and your copy could be worth some cash but who would buy scratched dvds the manufacturers have forgotten what new is i suppos
do n't get me wrong i love bill murray and i 'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he 's deserved but these wes anderson comedies '' are just lame rushmore started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out the royal tenenbaums was a without ever starting any story it felt like even if it was n't and now the life aquatic all of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts i do n't think there 's been a good comedy since a fish called wanda in 1988 although parts of the big lebowski are hilarious so i do n't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies most stink maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy that might explain the glowing reviews here although anderson 's films are competently made they feel stuffy and pretentious humorless i chuckled once per hour not a good average i do n't think this movie ever makes up its mind and i 'm so sick of owen wilson that i wish hollywood would give him a paid vacation does he have to be in every single movie ever made
it 's a disgrace they charge money for this dvd producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer unforgivable i prefer to have rated this with no stars
this was purhcased by accident but still one of the crapiest movies i ever seen story wise well it 's bad to see what situation young girls could have with whores for mothers and growing up just like them it 's actualy very sad to see young girls throwing away their life away other wise movie had bad ending good quality packing and dvd from
this movie based on the thomas harris book is a remake of the movie 'manhunter ' the story leads up to the events of the popular silence of the lambs film red dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of hanibal lecter unfortunately the supply of thomas harris books was exhausted so they revisited and retitled this prequel to the silence of the lambs in thomas harris 's book and the original manhunter lecter was an intriguing support character only but now hollywood has discovered that hannibal 's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in red dragon to add or lenghten scenes with lecter and put him center stage the original manhunter was a fine film directed by michael mann it featured brian cox bourne identity as lecter and william peterson csi as special agent graham this movie is lacking in all aspects to the original and to the book while anthony hopkins 's portrayal is as good as cox 's edward norton is clearly out of his depth he is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that agent graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families performances by harvey keitel and ralph fiennes are also wasted here my or rent the original
mccully 1 adam mccully instructor lee hobbs engl 101.025 18 november 2005 red dragon when i heard that universal studios was making a prequel to silence of the lambs i 'll admit that i was a little skeptical throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which more or less is what this prequel was caddyshack ii godfather iii and bill and ted 's bogus journey all horrible follow ups to great films so naturally i was a little worried that the film red dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film any movie that follows a great film like silence of the lambs has a lot to live up to personally i thought that the first sequel to silence of the lambs hannibal did n't quite achieve that and neither did red dragon it was a decent movie but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first do n't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value but since it did n't come first i had already come to expect that i thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films but clearly their work shows otherwise all in all this movie disappointed me for several reasons as i mentioned before the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that i as a fan of the films had come to expect but mostly it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors i 've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception
it followed the storyline very well and the cast was n't bad however it was n't smart to make this movie at the time they made it the 80 's and early 90 's did n't have the special effects that we have today the scenery was n't too good and the battle was n't exciting at all also it 's not smart to have actors were animal costumes it 's too childish
we checked this out from the library a couple of years ago it really was torture to watch the acting was terrible the costumes were even worse i do n't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production not one of bbc 's better efforts
this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package ! ! ! ! ! ! amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens ! however bird is the man and dont ever forget that
i guess success turned around for sam raimi in 2002 2004 with the two films but first he created this v '' like character in this garage of a movie i liked v for vendetta '' but not this darkman '' if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see v for vendetta '' do n't see darkman
i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i can not compare the character to other sources therefore coming from someone that did not know '' darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment ! there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies like the shadow batman etc which is interesting nevertheless darkman was quite a disappointment considering the of the cast liam neeson larry drake and frances mcdormand among others it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement in an effort to exact revenge he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his in short the acting and the plot are average nothing great while the dialogues are way below average the movie falls into the type of category the characters are overall bland and just plain uninteresting rick anderson played by the fool '' ted raimi from the xena series though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really in a nutshell it 's not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening 's entertainment and that 's about it no masterpiece here 2 stars
trying is the best word to describe this movie it tried my patience the opening scene was several minutes of nothing and i had to hold myself back from turning the movie off i told myself give it a chance and i repeated that through the entire film somewhere with in 90 minutes i just wanted to find out what was happening and why well i ca n't spoil the movie but it tried to be artistic in fact i think most of the people who review this movie with five stars want to be artsy examining composition and frames and dialog and colors and blah blah blah this movie was a waste of my time the only theme or concept i took away from the film was that upper class french people are annoying
very dissapointing dvd had great expectations given the cast the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor do not buy this film !
this movie should come with a prescription label that reads take this film at bedtime as needed for sleeplessness '' dear god what a boring montonous mess long static shots of a townhouse that last minutes at a time ambiguity and a frustratingly cryptic plot make this a very hard film to sit through i do n't need a movie to hold my hand and hit me over the head with answers but for the love of god reveal something interesting ! the excruciating glacial pace makes antonioni look like michael bay coffee was no cure neither was a bag of chips sleep overcame me despite my greatest desire to watch and pay close attention to this movie the startling moment '' everyone describes is when one character slices his own throat spraying blood everywhere this scene is almost incongruous since it is quick violent and horrifying unlike the rest of the movie i have watched hundreds of foreign movies and have liked most of them however cache is one of the worst i 've seen no resolution no answers incomprehensible no likeable characters impossibly slow i want to know why the main character was getting those videos sent to him and would someone please explain the last shot of the movie to me it is a long shot again of a school entrance with kids going back and forth then the main character 's kid and the algerian 's kid meet and talk to each other so what what the hell i slept through this movie just to see this scene i almost want to slash my own throat for watching this exercise supposedly this a movie about guilt and how it affects you your entire life the director should feel guilty for foisting this nonsense upon the audience and shilling it at as a suspense '' movie the only suspension i hold now is for movie review opinions that praise this movie endlessly these people have to be kidding oh and the rooster who gets his head cut off in a flashback scene at least he did n't have to sit through the rest of this movie fighting off drowziness and staring at interminable minutes of meaningless video of a townhouse
the fact that the story is left unresolved is n't particularly an issue for me in my opinion the movie is decent but the plain truth is that it is simply not that interesting of course it is a good premise basing a film on the human ability to deal with guilt the writer has chosen a random and mundane situation i 'm sure intentionally to delve into for the story but it just is n't all that good the acting is mediocre the pace is painfully slow it 's just not right for everyone i have a high tolerance for a film that eventually leads you somewhere but this movie was and led me to a disappointing ending 2 stars for the idea but that 's about it
after watching the film i studied '' the interview with the director i can see what he tried to say and what kinds of films he wanted to make but i 'm just curious to what extent the human mind is capable of handling the obscurity not knowing who actually made the videos and delivered them to the couple i do not think that the audience will be as cognitively active being eager to engage in some abstract moral speculation about the protagonist 's guilt over his memory or dreams as the director wants to think the more the audience want some closure the worse their reactions will be to this film
young ely braxton marcus thomas is an up and coming rodeo bull rider who suffers a movie opening serious injury brother hank kiefer sutherland is the responsible older brother who raises bulls teaches a style of bull riding your heart of hate before you ride ' that kind of thing and is a rodeo clown the fellow who distracts the bull after its thrown his rider and reasonably enough from the bull 's point of view wants to crush into pulp the prone body of the thrown rider i 've kind of made a point of searching out and watching rodeo movies there are n't a lot of them and most concentrate on the maverick qualities of the rodeo rider always a bull rider by the way most too feature some heavy hitters guys like steve mcqueen and cliff robertson in the lead roles cowboy up is a little different bull riding is more of a backdrop here a setting against which sibling rivalry a search for a lost father and some sticky romantic entanglements can be played out not that we do n't get a lot of shots of mucus draining bulls bucking and snorting and doing their best to toss and trample their tormenters again ' from the bull 's point of view it 's just there 's a whole lot more soap than horse in this opera which would n't be so bad if the second lead marcus thomas was a polished actor unfortunately his one expression seems to be that of stunned introspection as thought on the first day of the shoot a crew member had asked him a preposterous question that he could n't get out of his head thomas is talking to a grip say on that first day and the grip wonders out loud whether birds would have to fly if they had opposable thumbs thomas guffaws of course but every time the studio lights fire up the question returns to gnaw at him and when he should be the moment ' or whatever it is actors say with movie girlfriend connie molly ringwald instead he 's picturing a southbound autumn highway with clusters of hitchhiking ducks i 'm not sure it matters anyway the story 's kind of an hybrid to begin with things become more complicated later when young ely hooks up with pretty rodeo horse rider celia jones daryl hannah brother hank 's old flame which supplies just enough plot to propel the film to the grand finale ely 's search for his missing father is resolved although that search was so unstressed in the movie i did n't even realize it was a big issue until it was on me and of course as in almost all rodeo movies ely gets to ride the big bull preferably the one who threw him earlier in this case the big bull is zapata one of brother hank 's bulls in fact i 've never been a big fan of kiefer sutherland but he 's great in this one ringwald hannah and melinda dillon the mother in both encounters of the third kind ' and christmas story ' are wasted as sideline fodder who have little more to do than seduce or wring their hands and hope ely gets some sense and give up the bull riding the highlight of the movie for me came when while hannah and thomas were deep in their fling ringwald and sutherland shared a piece of consolation pie at the local diner ringwald inevitably i guess says to sutherland a different world you and i would have made a lot more sense ' hey molly in a different and better movie you and sutherland would have made a lot more sense too cowboy up might appeal to rodeo fans but the rest of us would be better advised to steer clear of this one
this movie could have been so much more than it is it offers up more wasted potential than an american idol '' audition first there 's the angle of the absent father while we 're thrown some teasers and even a between him and ely we are not ultimately emotionally satisfied with the outcome there 's no real resolution no deep truth then there 's the angle of the love triangle '' this never took off simply because celia and hank had no further interaction once she and ely took up together and then ely parted ways with her entirely through all this hannah delivers no stunning performance her character is fairly at best and then there 's the drive to win '' that ely is supposed to evince this never really appears we 're just supposed to understand how driven he is by his brooding looks and foolhardy acts i will give kudos to the slow motion filming sequences in the beginning and the end they are affective however we could 've done with a little less bull drool flying through the air like a trapeze act all in all this movie is plagued by wasted potential the waste of molly ringwald 's character is especially troubling why even introduce her if she is n't going to play a pivotal role in what happens with ely and hank a lot of this film seeming plodding and pointless i wanted to like this movie i truly did i 'm a whopping huge pbr fan and desperately wanted to like this movie however the movie itself prevented me from doing so
this movie could had been better had it offered an interesting story and better acting the only one into this project is keifer sutherland the others basically coast through their parts darryl hanna is virtually and molly ringwald does not have much to do the ending makes no sense either it does give you some sense of how hard insane the whole bull riding thing is but that does not make up for the film 's serious defects i want my 100 minutes back
this movie sucks ! it is fake everything is staged chicks dont laugh when they fight nor do they dress like strippers !
absolutely do not buy this video 1 the fights are not fights they are boring and tiresome staged tapping pushing and pulling matches nobody wants to hurt anyone and nobody wants to get hurt 2 jerry springer fights are 10 times better than anything on this video these girls keep their clothes on and tussle like grade girls at a sleepover 3 has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they do n't fight 4 the most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say you better get out my room ! you get out ! says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed complete waste of time and money you want chick fights look elsewhere
this dvd sucks all the fights '' are fake retarted drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time i 've ever had in my life i am now stupider for watching this dvd and buying it is on my list of regrets i have in life i wish i could say the only good part was but there was no good part no shirts ripped off or good hits thrown nothing i am a marine stationed in japan looking for a dvd to enjoy and this is what i get where is the love
this is the worst i do mean worst video i have ever bought the fights are all staged and really bad the bad thing is that the girls ca n't even fake fight i bought this with the brawlin broads dvd and i must say the brawlin broads is much better even though it is staged as well the white trash women they pay to fight in there actually fight wow do not buy this trash if you want to see some good staged fighting get brawlin broads instead
not the product i was interested in pathetic version of an actual good dvd little information given which led me to believe it was the real thing
this is not the real deal the dvd graphic shown above is not the same as the actual dvd it is taken from the earlier dvd release the one that had real the dvd that is on offer has similiar cover but of a staged fight all it is is a bunch of models slapping each other yeah i know it sounds hot but it is n't and that is about it all the action is staged and except for one of the beach fights '' it is pretty boring not much happens and beyond the hottie factor there is n't much going on do n't believe the fake positive reviews written below they are done by publicists and should be taken with a grain of salt one star some of the chicks are hot but c'mon fake is fake
rants from a socialist in denial only thinly veiled lies and distortions packaged as documentary i 'd only pick this up if i ran out of toilet paper after i rented bowling for columbine i returned it to the store they gave me my money back for the rental but if they had given me twice the rent price back i 'd still feel ripped off
michael moore hates america this is evident in all of his movies and also proven when he goes oversees to make money by badmouthing us here at home if you want to waste your money to see a film so horribly slanted in his own opinion with quotes taken out of context then by all means buy this collection if you want to really find out what michael moore is up to go to or read michael moore is a big fat stupid white man '' you can find the book here at and i promise it will be a better way to spend your hard earned money
there are two types of obsessive stalker movies the fatal attraction or the so i married an axe murder type if no rabbits die in the first hour of the movie you know that the heroine is really being stalked by her new boyfriend 's best from the university of iowa whereas the fatal attraction variety of stalker movie offers a nice ramping up of paranoia until the requisite danger filled ending the latter type of stalker movie spends a half hour in sweaty close up of the two naked stars and an hour of one of them misinterpreting everything until we learn the shocking truth it 's a dull formula and why hollywood sticks to the formula is beyond me in case you have n't already guessed this movie is the latter of course if you are thinking of buying this movie you are probably thinking of buying it to see heather graham naked again do n't bother the hot and sweaty scenes are all tired nothing really says that the stars want to be with each other for any reason other than paychecks and the 10 minutes of naked heather graham are not worth the price tag it 's not like you 're going to watch the rest of it just get boogie nights and rewatch her roller girl scene if that 's what you want to see or watch swingers and watch her fully clothed but infinitely more seductive than this version
killing me softly '' has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break not only does it set up an improbable situation but the big twist '' at the end is also predictable unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned he 's an inexpressive bloke while heather graham is all too expressive she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera besides she 's not even that attractive even her in this particular film natascha mcelhone blows her out of the water in that department the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker ' candy in your mouth sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly in spite of all that chen kaige 's direction is good and he creates some suspenseful moments so i give the film a generous out of 5 '' rating but if you 're a heather graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes and for joseph fiennes fans you 'll receive half naked perks
do not read any further if you do n't want to know the climax of this inferior thriller gwyneth paltrow quickly recovering after hours of intense natural childbirth labor ! ! ! ! ! to go to the garage and find the evidence that jessica lange killed her husband and having the strength to belt lange in the process and looking downright none the worse for wear to boot was totally unbelievable and implausible there is no way in real life that this could have occurred ! it takes days for a woman who has undergone natural childbirth to get back on her feet yet paltrow is presented as though it was as easy as getting a good night 's rest and getting up feeling refreshed full of vim and vigor ! ! total nonsense the performances of the principals mostly lange and paltrow make up for the implausibilities of the script nina foch does a dandy turn as the granmother but the scene where lange turns up the cold water in her steam bath is also unbelievable in the next scene foch is revealed to be fine and happy pneumonia no after effects ! ! this film was one big disappointment and i give it two stars for the acting because the story is pure fluff all the actors deserve better here ! ! no wonder this film was a hush '' at the came and went quickly and i can understand why
whatever possessed jessica lange to appear in this mess will never be known the payoff at the end is a huge disappointment jessica lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in gwyneth paltrow is unbelievably bad but i think this is not their fault the screenplay and direction could have been better this could have been a very good movie along the lines of misery '' or fatal attraction '' but it fails in every department as i said the payoff at the end is a real disappointment this film is a waste of time and money stay away from it !
kelly preston and tcheky karyo are a new york city couple who come together after preston leaves matthew broderick and karyo uses meg ryan in order to get a visa now broderick and ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex 's the problem is the offenses they 've endured being dumped and being used do n't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people especially karyo which is probably why director griffin dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles after all how can we not root for ferris bueller and harry 's sally unfortunately it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive the pace of the film is so uneven and the script is n't particularly funny there 's a difference between black comedy and just comedy despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches this film does not walk that line very well
now i 'm usually one what finds anything old bob and david have to offer as funnier than a clown holdin ' a bag of farts but run ronnie run '' is not on par with previous show offerings for those of you who are fans of show and the original ronnie skit you are n't gon na find much new here pretty much a rehashing of that same skit which plays the skit hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of bob and david 's talents granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show but the laughs get spread pretty thin i subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segway at certain points to another skit as show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons the movie 's worth a view for you show fans but ca n't say i 'd add it to my collection keep 'em coming
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens very disapointtin
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism by female director heckerling ! she duplicated it in chevy chase vehicle national lampoon 's european vacation too ! many child actors got their start here but the thing that cracked me up as i saw it when it came out nately was the dialog of my fav band cheap trick ticket scalper the magntism of robin zander and the charisma of rick nielsen and what about the tunes 'i want you to want me the dream police 'you 're momma 's alright your daddy's alright they just seem a little weird surrender surrender '' before he 's interrupted if that is n't somebody's idea of 'surrender ' they 've stumbled onto this review by mistake
in 1973 director nicholas roeg took a daphne du maurier story about a strained family situation added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction cast wonderful talented actors such as donald sutherland and julie christie and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror the unmissable do n't look now '' six years later cronenberg obviously oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly imagery and understated elegance of the roeg picture decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme with disasterously boring results to synopsise the plot frank carveth 's estranged wife is crazy and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist 's controversial institute suspecting her of abusing their daughter he removes her from his wife 's care to the strenuous objections of her shrink several people connected to wifey 's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead and carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother 's 'other ' set of kids so it 's david cronenberg so what performances and direction as well as screenplay are all simply mundane there 's barely a shred of the sleek polished talent we have come to recognise as david cronenberg and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic american horror movies as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the it 's almost got the sense of isolation of 'the shining ' but there are too many incidental characters it 's almost got the same sense of as 'hallowe'en ' but lacks the decisive action of that movie it 's close to the stark imagery and sense of as 'carrie ' and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to piper laurie ! but samantha eggar 's performance is too overblown makeup effects too are for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama in that they just look silly of course you could say the same for 'the exorcist ' nowadays but where that film still has the incredible strength of ellen burstyn 's and linda blair 's performances all 'the brood ' has to go on is some deformed that hiss a lot it 's not good in short where a movie matters most 'the brood ' fails wholly to deliver instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema a note on the subtext it 's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein sure topics like the state of the nuclear family and the negative effects of a mother 's love are riveting things when handled properly unfortunately when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone who could care less about subtext i could n't
david cronenberg 's the brood '' is a disturbing and at times disgusting movie with a softcore element of creepinees that said i did not find the brood '' to be very scary at all the acting was good but the storyline and plot just did n't do it for me certainly an imaginative and creative story the brood '' centers around a mother 's rage and psychological condition being manifested into little devilish like creatures by the help of a rather radical psychiatric treatment by raglan played well by oliver reed it is up to the husband of the pycholgically disturbed woman named nola to save the day and to save their little girl 's life the actual manifestations of nola 's rage are creepy in a sense and yet laughable as well indeed the brood '' is pretty over the top and requires the audience to buy into the nola 's and the psychiatrist 's joint ability to be able to manifest nola 's rage into a kind of human yet malignant form but also accept these little creatures which are somewhat creepy but also quite ridiculous as is the plot i might add pure fans of the horror genre will walk away a bit unfulfilled after viewing the brood '' which simply does n't have the bite '' of a truly good horror movie and is in all honesty a very weird outrageous and absolutely ridiculous movie i know i found myself weary of these absurd little creatures and their supposedly horror movie villain type prowess finally is it just me or is everyone in this movie absolutely crazy lol anyway that said fans of wild unique and downright crazy horror movies may find this one interesting the brood '' probably does n't quite deserve two stars but it is original and an eyebrow raiser if nothing else that much is for sure
nicolas cage is good as the wierd lonner type roles and has an oscar to prove it however this role calls for more than that you have to be a straght arrow and he is n't not one good part to this film i was looking at my watch 5 mins into this mess tommy lee jones must have needed the money so i can forget his less than 100 try as nicks trainner and commander what a waste of tim
as stated in other reviews this movie is a joke granted the cinematography is good and there 's excitement but if you film a pig flying and have good cinematography and story you 'd get the same 'excitement ' i also am in army aviation and it 's disappointing to have such a deviation from the truth filmed many movies make some adjustments that border on reality and some go outside that boundary this movie transcends to another plane of existence and commits suicide if i were an actor and offered a role in this movie i would have run away knowing the repercussions it would have on my career
if you know anything about army aviation or apaches fire birds will either tick you off or make you laugh till you puke this was supposed to be the army 's top gun so sad it 's so unrealistic i wish the army had had veto power on this one before it was released
i was in the army when this came out working on helicopters i saw the movie at travis afb in california as much as i saw i did walk out of the theatre even yelling quips at all of the cheezy lines and there are plenty was n't entertainment enough to keep me from screaming at my shoes i left fuming and spent the next hour waiting in a cold for the rest of my buddies to get done watching it i 'm sickened watching nicholas cage to this very day
i agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there are n't more dissenting opinions this movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it the topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough exploration of the art to make it interesting the story rambled and the americans yes that includes paul pena behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch there was just a vulgar tone throughout the whole movie in many scenes paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent he comes across as pathetic socially tone deaf and totally unworthy of his own talent mario was a boor always coming up with something obnoxious loud and totally irrelevant to say why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery the filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it do n't bother with this one
i hate to be the only one to say it but this movie sucked it 's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational this movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful the main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass he manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in tuva and in one instance hands an unsuspecting tuvan a joint not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well but its hard to take since paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed but paul isnt the only ass of this documentary he also has help from his friends of tuva and the filmers if there is any value in watchings this piece of its in what not to do when you visit other countries seriously one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there from that character 's earlier appearences in the film i would have to say that he would have deserved it the only thing going for this movie is photage of acual tuvan 's singing im so sorry they had to meet this guy if you do decide to get this do n't forget to watch the interview with the directors thats definately the best part ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before but this two are like charactures of them if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing the journey of man
dated derivative unintelligent this is truly bottom of the range stuff the acting directing soundtrack and script are all dire none of the characters are even remotely sympathetic in fact i was hoping they 'd die slowly and painfully i note that billy bob thornton was both star and a scriptwriter methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose an arrogant amoral misogynistic coward with zero sense of humour do n't waste your time watching this drivel it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase
i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run '' movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
mission impossible the tv series told the adventures of the impossible missions force an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins foreign dictators terrorists and others who threatened the security of the united states rather than engage in james shoot outs the imf team worked together to covertly neutralize threats leaving little or no trace of their involvement although the imf had a leader steven hill as dan briggs and peter graves as jim phelps there was no star of the group just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective a truly groundbreaking show along comes brain de palma 's catastrophe of a remake starring that scientologist tom cruise within half an hour of the film starting the entire imf team save for cruise is killed off jim phelps jon voight is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original mission impossible is shot to hell granted ving rhames and jean reno are present as cruise 's new team but mission impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another tom cruise vehicle where he preens and postures making a film called mission impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original tv series it 's obscene what tom cruise 's ego has done to bruce geller 's original concept this is just another action film with cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself see the original tv series and skip this piece of bastardized trash
even though i would agree that erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath '' story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true '' story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich 's story in the same way that the xena '' character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess '' though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman '' prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin 's boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy mules than on the personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and george who becomes erin 's the convenience '' factor is totally and for erin 's benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus '' check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with illnesses that the plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie not even slightly
when this dvd was first watched the adults in our household thought that these winnie the pooh stories did a very good job introducing ghosts to the 23 month old in the house however in recent days we have decided to hide this movie because it has caused the 23 month old to worry about ghosts now even though we told her and she agrees with us verbally that ghosts are not real this little girl is an avid movie watcher and has an amazing concentration level when it comes to watching them unfortunately she has internalized this one and now will not go to bed in her room at night alone and she has never had a problem going to bed before parents beware of this dvd just because it is pooh does not mean it is totally harmless to impressionable little minds
this movie was surprisingly bad despite the generally positive reviews from amazon and the combined force of johnny depp and christopher walken i could n't wait for nick of time '' to end first off the plot was so absurd it was laughable i do n't usually like when somebody calls a movie unrealistic but nick of time '' was exactly that it is nearly impossible to enjoy the film given the ridiculous story line even if you manage to get past the story line the movie is not suspenseful in any way you 'll predict the ending after the first five minutes secondly although i love both walken and depp neither is at their best in this film i ca n't even blame them given the poor script this story would make the performance of any actor hard to believe finally there are absolutely no redeeming qualities from the film i 've seen movies that were altogether much worse that had at least something i found interesting this movie just did n't have anything at all i would recommend you avoid this film because you most definitely will be disappointed if you are a fan of walken and depp as i am avoid it anyway you can find these two in a ton of other excellent movies
the dvd is missing some of the scenes that are in the tv version there are no deleted scenes either where did the scenes go and why i expected the dvd to have more not less than the tv version
titanic revealed i just purchased the dvd of this production after watching the entire feature along with extras i have to admit i 'm a bit disappointed from the way this dvd is promoted you expect a documentary of ballard going back to the titanic to go over what the grave robbers have done to it and document its condition sadly we get that but in much less quantity that i expected what we do often get is mini segments about titanic collectors super secret navy missions commentaries from people within the community and a debate about whether salvaging is appropriate the interview with ken marschall is especially akward the segement about ballard 's super secret '' mission i think was being over dramatic and unecessary many people knew of his dives on the thresher and the scorpion right before the titanic so thats not some huge revelation as to why he got to search for the ship in 1985. personally i was hoping for something akin to the national geographic special secrets of the titanic '' while filmed in 1985 with less sophisticated cameras it honored the ship with no jim cameron style fluff and detours that 1985 documentary stands out against later videos it has heart its human and it focuses on the ship the titanic is the star not a sub not a film maker ballard 's original piece humanizes the wreck the humanization is one of the most powerful elements of the titanic story in the final anaylsis this production does not live up to how it hypes itself it should be titled titanic debates with some footage of bob ballard again at the titanic '' that is far more honest as to what this dvd is only the special section only partially redeems itself it though is way too short and recycles video from the main feature i agree with ballard it is terrible the way the wreck is being plundered for profit titanic is a graveyard and should be treated as such with great respect it should be honored and allowed to rest without vultures picking at the carcass more than one titanic survivor felt that way for the price almost 18 stay away from this dvd if it were 5 i 'd say its fine however for the hefty price tag for an hour and 15 minutes of a presentation that does n't live up to its billing do n't waste your money
the remake took out the best elements of the original while keeping its initial problems some of them being the sudden mutual understanding that a fog is responsible for the deaths as well as the mishap '' that the fog 's in the remake look just as campy as the original ones the acting is absolutely dreadful i had hopes for selma blair but nevermind carpenter 's version gave us at least some rock solid minutes by hal hoolbrock janet leigh and john houseman even tom atkins beats the hell out of the pretty boy poorly taking over his role the camera work is reminiscent of productions suited for television yet not fit for the silver screen the editing is way too quick something i blame many current filmmmakers for who paste the story together so quickly that the viewer does n't even have time to let the action on screen sink in the soundtrack generic bass sounds horns the usual carpenter 's fistful of repetitive piano notes had at the time more impact this remake just like the majority of other remakes was designed to suck ten bucks out of the pockets of horror film fans who should know better by now did i mention that this film is family friendly 'nough said
some movies are not be remade this remake does not have the creepy settings or lighting of the original the cast stinks why did they change the story it is too if you want to see better acting creepier settings and a music score that will scare you see the original
john carpenter 's fog ' may not be his greatest film and that is exactly the reason for remaking or improving it the character of vengeful blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today 's special effects revolution studios seems to have thought the same way but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself what is wrong the answer is clear that is the film 's incoherent storytelling which made me dizzy while watching it the original 's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town or an island whatever shrouded in a fog so far it 's good but the problem is how to tell this story apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions it can sneak into a kitchen but not a fridge it can turn a human into a corpse in a second but it uses that trick not much because it seems to know that the cgi is costly the lack of consistent logics just helps make the film slow and pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film 's plot in horror films i usually do n't expect much from the characters but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid if you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer you wo n't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend forget the law of physics here if your car crashes overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea you would get seriously hurt not in this film because of the driver happens to be the star of the film new version of fog ' is not scary well the original was not that scary but it was moody and stylish they certainly did change some part of the original but none of the changes make sense so why did they remake it
ok now i am afraid to try any other our gang dvds ! no one mentions how poor the sound is so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said ! this made this dvd worthless in my opinion
four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction loaded with drugs with paul mccartney in charge what do you get magical mystery tour with no plot great music this plays as a music video without purpose ok if you 're a beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967. but if you were n't a beatles fan then there is no reason for this at least a hard days ' night with richard lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers but this too many drugs and too much ego and no direction that 's all
i have been a beatles fan since 1964 and i have distinct memories of the band 's influence on my young life i saw hard day 's night help ! yellow submarine and let it be in the theater when they were first released this film has always been the holy grail of beatle fandom now that i own it i can honestly say i understand why it took so long to release it to the public that thirty years of isolation locked up in a vault somewhere in london only improved its standing in my imagination not on actual film the bbc was right to bury this as a film or television special it 's horrible but as a fan i had to have it now that 's all i can say about it i own it when will let it be be released
upon its initial release the attention that otto preminger 's anatomy of a murder '' attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems when watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center attorney paul biegler james stewart is asked to defend lieutenant frederick manion ben gazzara after a bar owner is found murdered manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife laura lee remick was raped while preparing his case for trial biegler finds that laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature nevertheless the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him stewart is his dependable self in anatomy of a murder '' in fact his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film there is little nuance in the performances of gazzara and remick and even the great george scott misses the mark with an effort yet the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay anatomy of a murder '' oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story the investigation of the crime is done in a manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction for a film to run as long as anatomy of a murder '' does one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film yet this is not the case
i fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal however then the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began and the antiquated ideas about provocation of rape '' were ceaselessly unpealed leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed how she acted if she flirted reflections of a bygone era when a crime was n't a crime but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line but even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end no smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor 's awareness of the victims paternal history nonsense and 3 hours down the tubes however the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge and the appearance of a young george scott who at that age was interestingly a deadringer for michael douglass jimmy does a job as always
terrible transfers and yes you get 50 movies for about 13 but look at the titles carefully if you feel you can enjoy at least 2 of the movies then this set is worth it for me it was being able to watch horror express '' and bad taste '' for the time in decades otherwise wow ! there 's a lot of crappy movies in the box
i bought this set just for that movie and it 's not on here ! ! why ! i am so mad
a question for anyone who has this dvd pack i am after a movie my friends and i watched years ago it was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home a killer is running lose as we hear on the news playing on the car radio the petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting he tries to get her out of the car but she wont he attacks the car trying to get her out what she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her this short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game we would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it we are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon thank you aussie girls
the delivery was quick however the quality of the picture on most of the movies leaves a lot to be desired
simply put the movie is boring upon is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural '' response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend '' and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie save your money save your time choose another movie
there is a certain school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash '' but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream '' motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek
me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive '' than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever ! perhaps i 'm biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers
viewed it was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching waiting hoping ! ! ! the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the advise is for you to save your money and buy comos the best imo to be honest i could n't wait to sell it used at a 10 lose through following week they get a commission for sold items nonetheless i am content i no longer own time i will rent before purchasing on amzn just so you know cosmos '' i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from late carl sagans '' cosmos '' blows away the astronomer ''
i watched this because it has big gipp from the goodie mobb in it that is the high point the movie is not very good if your a goodie mobb fan rent it just out of curiosity if not stay away from this one
i am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like because this movie stinks ! im a huge reese witherspoon fan and i like paul rudd so i rented this movie and thought it would be good oh boy i was wrong the charachters are over the top and the story is just cheesy im all for a good fun romantic comedy i like win a date with tad hamilton '' but this is just awful reese plays a stripper somehow it just doesnt work who helps the dorky hopeless rudd dump then win back his girlfriend all the time there is a package to stop hence the name overnight delivery '' the story could have worked but it just doesnt the premise is good and there are parts that are somewhat ammusing but overall it sucks i would reccomend this movie to anyone who liked the sarah michelle gellar movie simply irresistable '' if you happened to like that movie with the magical little crab if you disliked it as i did then stay away
although i love the firm this one is not my is a good workout there is just something about it it ms delrio is not quite as toned as one would do n't one point she has her eyes shut while she have dozens of firms and some with this instructor that i seems that most firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it but this one falls short in some indescribable way
most of these reviews look like they have been posted by employees of the company that released them they read like the fake tesimonials in cheezy infomercials seriously would you buy another great firm video '' as genuine feedback please
this was very enjopyable when it first aired on television but is is dated and not as good as i recall from 30 years ag
lets starting boycotting tv series to dvd box set from they are the only ones that charges the highest price the season of mccloud was originally televised six -60 min episodes instead universal give three 90 min episodes in which 30 min is missing from each of those episodes also do n't provide the original music in their box sets so maybe if sales drop they will start providing the episodes uncut with the original music instead of the cheap substitute music and cut episodes they give us now ! season 1970 part of 1 16 sep 70 man from taos 1 orig who says you ca n't make friends in new york city 60 min 2 23 sep 70 manhattan manhunt 1 orig horse stealing on fifth avenue 60 min 3 30 sep 70 murder arena 1 orig the concrete corral 60 min 4 7 oct 70 manhattan manhunt 2 orig the stage is all the world 60 min 5 14 oct 70 murder arena 2 orig walk in the dark 60 min 6 21 oct 70 man from taos 2 orig our man in paris 60 min
i remember watching the nbc mystery movie in the i remember the theme music not on the dvd by the way for the series and the guy with the flashlight just like everyone else who grew up with tv in the i really looked forward to the release of mcmillan and wife and mccloud especially since i had n't seen many episodes since my childhood the is awful the plots are lousy the jokes are lame the arguing with the chief forced the with chris ridiculous ! not enough terry carter either the guest stars except julie sommars are given almost nothing to do ! i am desperately waiting for december and the release of season one of the rockford files i 've seen that show often through the years and it combined great acting writing and sometimes nostalgia stinks
we bought the series '' what we got was season 2 complete unless any were originally 2 hours in length the pilot tv movie mccloud who killed miss bearing the syndication title portrait of a dead girl and three movies '' each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random unrelated episodes of the show 's first season which ran under the umbrella title 4 in 1 and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix ! for those studio executives who do n't understand the concept nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing the way it was not frankensteined into phony movies if universal had any integrity at all they 'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited original network versions of these six episodes with the 4 in 1 umbrella sequence and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1 season 1. i supposed next we 'll have to beware of columbo and other mystery movie episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform and yet being sold as the complete season !
george sluizer 's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes ' plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they do n't even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they 're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 's end on a joke like a tv cop show ' moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one
why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd seriously the child of a masterpiece the vanishing '' sports some of the most performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90 's this is n't a matter of comparison this movie all by itself just sucks if i had n't seen the original i 'd just think what a brilliant plot too bad they decided to bury it no pun intended with everything else in the movie '' jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great gut wrenchingly disturbing hitchcockian 1988 movie sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves which add nothing to the movie and the ending oh the ending we 've been cheated totally cheated all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of it has to be upbeat ! '' hollywood cornball syndrome sandra bullock is rescued the villain is hit with a shovel and everything is ! even though kiefer sutherland 's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated this is of a great movie
this is awful simply awful the effects on mighty joe young were laughable back in 1998 and looking at them now after seeing the glory that is peter jackson 's king kong no just no bill paxton also needs to be banned from acting hell even congo was better than this tripe
tony robinson has the skill through his personality to convince the viewer of the thoroughness of his research and sincerity indeed that is what comes over in this documentary unfortunately when the documentary is closely examined it is not objective for example robinson conducts an irrelevant grail chase and he ridicules dan brown 's claim that all the art architecture and secret societies in his book are real however robinson does not prove that any of these are false it is true that he challenges their significance but that is not the same as proving that brown was wrong in identifying them this documentary lacks the balance that is necessary to make it credible and my impression is that it follows a preconceived notion to present the book as a hoax unfortunately robinson appears to have lost the plot for the book is a work of fiction
the soundtrack does not match the film you are seeing and it is really irritating it 's off by a few seconds i 'm sure i would have enjoyed it more had it been in synch
i cancelled this order since i already had this dvd with a different front cover so i did not receive this product please check your records thanks mitzi hei
i enjoyed the movie even though i was only able to watch it in segments the first time i tried to watch it after about 20 minutes the screen went to digital gibberish and my dvd player hung up so that i could n't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power i had to unplug the dvd player wait and replug the power cord to remove the disc overnight i decided i needed to replace my dvd player however the next morning i tried a different dvd and it worked fine it still works fine on all my other dvds i complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of showgirls unfortunately this one has the same problem it plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my dvd player i gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without showgirls i use my dvd player almost every day and it works fine except when i try to watch showgirls
big budget but big on stoopid '' as well the cast had some great potential but the film flops on the tedious tantrum filmed performance of its lead elizabeth berkley nomi leaves a bad life moving to las vegas in search of a better one in the bright lights she meets molly who takes her in and eventually finds herself working at the cheetah doing lap dances while looking for her big break at one of the more upscale clubs she gets her chance when cristol conners gershon current diva of the stage at the stardust buys her beau zack carey maclachlan the stardust 's entertainment manager a lapdance from nomi while fending off the lesbian advances of conners nomi manages to score big she bags the role of conners ' understudy snatches conners ' man zach and eventually dumps conners down a flight of stairs in order to get herself into the spotlight elizabeth berkley is a cinderella who behaves more like one of the wicked her interaction with others is either temper tantrum or sweet little innocent oftentimes within the same scene take some prozac sister ! the amount of time the other more substantial leads spend pursuing her in the face of her abuse tantums and such makes the whole film less than credible everyone spends alot of time nude in the film berkley shows all of her openings gratuitiously and her inane love scenes with maclachlan who shows quite a bit of backside are more funny than erotic there is nothing erotic about this film though gershon does show a vampishly stylish performance robert davi as owner of the cheetah is sleazily charming as is lin tucci the bawdy big lady who provides comic relief during the shows maclachlan well he 's never been one of my favorite actors neither for looks or talent but he does have a fine ass and shows quite a bit of it in the film
it 's well known that 'showgirls ' flopped i remember director paul verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year ' it 's not hard to point out its failure the young attractive lead elizabeth berkley can not act as elizabeth is in focus quite a lot her frequent appearance turns 'showgirls ' into disaster in hindsight it 's incredible that an experienced director like paul verhoeven hired someone like her i guess the blatant display of nudity in berkley 's role as well as in this whole movie made better actresses look elsewhere the more so while 'showgirls ' theme and plot are somewhat meagre one star for the effort and another for the nice picturing any lavish display of female nudity can not cover the failure of 'showgirls ' concept
i read the book and saw the movie which other than title and major characters have little in common i ca n't say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire '' taught me about roman a clefs '' of which devil '' is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil '' provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly of runway magazine but somehow she 's never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second or third made over princess '' role the minor characters including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend '' lily are mostly wasted
i bought i and ii of this released wolf 's rain because when i first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending i am sooooooooooooo disappointed because now that i have the second part there is no alternate ending and i now see that that review has been deleted i think amazon handled this whole thing very poorly we depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices
i was under the impression that this was the entire series i finally after many issues got my set and unwrapped it and my heart sank audibly when i saw complete collection i '' i popped the last disk in and lo and behold it was n't the full series afterall
this is still cool but you only get 4 volumes not the full 7 i recmend if u realy want the complete colletion go to best buy and buy it for the 100
this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix there wasnt much to make this unrated if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity forget it ! the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies however if your someone who likes to use your imagination this might be for you one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies if your a big drew fan like me it might be worth buying utherwise go buy a playgirl
this movie was extreamly stupid but very funny we just laughed though this hole movie this was pretty much very soft porn the hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them the special effects sucked they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes the black and white ones ! ! the acting was very bad and this movie is very anticrist
this movie is typical hollywood trash the show biz '' liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers '' a much better and far more honest film
i do n't think i saw the same movie that others who have reviewed this movie did i thought that it was one of the worst films that i have ever seen i hated it let me get this straight people really appreciated and liked a movie about a low budget '' pimp who was tricking '' a girl so that he could achieve his dream '' of being a rap star '' now the actors did the best that they could with what they had but it still only merits a and i am stretching the 1 star i am now back to the complicated '' plot girl he has been pimping she sleeps with a loser at a pawn shop to get her pimp a microphone ends up becoming a business woman '' she sleeps with a disc jokey to have her imprisoned pimps music played on the air there was a scene that i found to be very entertaining one character staples fast food cup holders to the wall to make it sound proof so the pimp can have a studio dumb ! there were so many dumb parts in this movie i lost track of them all on top of being dumb one of the actresses the pregnant one who was standing by her '' while he is in jail for beating up another rap star '' who dissed him that 's plot becomes way complicated and is that a word comes out of this whole experience thinking she can really sing '' in real life and sang it at the oscars last year and still i am wondering what planet i am on because they gave the stupid song an oscar for best movie maybe i dreamed all that or maybe i just do n't know what a good movie is about ! but in my opinion this was not it
terence howard stars as a pimp that 's looking to better '' his life by making in big in rap music a mediocre film that further pushes the stereotype of black people and it 's a poor attempt to draw pity toward people that spend their lives making excuses for the dirty deeds they do nobody is forced to be a pimp sorry go get a job even if it 's at the store atleast you would have some dignity then pimps have no dignity what 's shocking is there 's women that condone this movie and what it contains but hey we live in a sick world now so who can be surprised
go to youtube watch the mad tv dane cook parody then listen to this and try to tell the difference betcha a million bucks you ca n't ! dane cook used to be funny but his act has worn extremely thin he 's hit completely rock bottom i have a big sense of humor even though i know he stole jokes from louis and wanted to bed jessica simpson i could look past all that if he was actually funny but he 's not not anymore a totally '' performance dane has the last laugh he writes observational '' jokes that actually are n't observations on life at and he laughs all the way to the bank i 'd advise you to stick with his performances before this unless you like disappointment
this movie was ok but kind of depressing the whole show builds up to this one thing that never happens and there is not munch of a happy ending sean was great in it a very diffrent chracter
i recently gave this movie another shot at the request of a friend i was impressed this time with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography it 's as if every scene could be a postcard and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing and the songs are great if a little forced '' into the movie unfortunately that 's all there is except beautiful brad rowe totally wasted here in this nothing piece about and galling disregard for everyone that loves you while pining away for what you obviously ca n't have add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others sean hayes ' character while simply pursuing your own desires i want to be there for him '' right it 's so artificial it 's about as convincing as plastic palm trees there are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long pauses of nothing someone made this picture to fulfill their dream and did a fine job of casting and cinematography there is little else to see here even as a fluff piece it 's barely worth your time
ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is dogs this has great actors in it i enjoyed seeing f'instance dame dunaway but she sinise dillon mantegna and perpetual faison had a poor dialog to work with imagine if qt had written it or my favorite tough guy screenwriter david mamet fortunately though spacey will have something to build on develop a director 's
do not buy this movie sounds good on paper but throughout the whole film nothing happens unfortunately i kept waiting for the payoff believe me there is n't one
was hoping this would be a lot of fun for my 9 year old and her younger brothers too forget it extremely overwhelming for beginner dancers and ' dancing moms too the moves are cool no doubt but my kids wo n't even attempt it the coordination is not there not not not begginner friendly too fast and too hard
i bought this dvd for my 3 year old who loves to dance when the dvd arrived i got him all pumped up to watch a dance video popped it in and error '' was all i got i took it to a friend 's house and it played i have a panasonic dvd player purchased in the united states and have never had any problem reading a dvd maybe this problem is uniquely mine but if not it would be nice if amazon could post more compatibility information to avoid others having such a disappointment
i never read the book and never plan on reading it so unlike most of the other low rankings based on a bad adaptation of the book mine 's different i saw patriot games and enjoyed it so i bought this one too but it does n't come close to its predecessor the first one never let up and was always suspensful and exciting this one is completely different personally for all of you complaining about how it strayed from the book which i have n't read that would be tolerable if it were a good movie i 'm not even going to talk about the plot because it 's so complicated at times i would be tearing my hair out because of all of the stuff going on at the same time double crosses hidden deals with colombians secret partnerships weird murders well anyway with all of this stuff plus a lot more going on at the same time i lost all hope and was staring at a screen which appeared blank to me sure movies should n't be very simple but there comes a point when a movie is too complicated and it was in this movie so do n't rent or buy it because you 'll be very confused and bored believe me it 's boring so rent or buy patriot games and act like this does n't even exist
this movie was rather dissapointing to me if you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one it does n't have too much action except towards the end the animation is also rather lacking and is rather outdated for instance lots of time when one character is moving and talking the rest of the screen is completely stil
the animation was cool but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance this movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting also remember the speeder chase through the forest in star wars return of the jedi well expect to hear those very sound bytes for the alien fighters in this
i watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies he did his best not to divide india and it was all jinnah who divided and founded pakistan gandhi was totally against it in short wasted my money i would rather be watching a silly comedy show that must have been atleast better than this movie
at the beginning of the film while on a train ghandi ben killingsley is white not he is completely white everyone in the class i was watching it with was totally confused why the hell was this white guy calling himself ghandi i started to think that maybe ghandi had a skin pigment problem because in every scene he went from light to to black as night it was like a rotation i was thoroughly confused we get to watch ghandi get arrested about 8 times during the movie it gets to the point where the story is n't going anywhere you just keep watching him get arrested then all of a sudden the british want to move out because the indians do n't fight back when they are hit with sticks when the indians are being beaten by the police its almost like a 3 stooges routine i understand the message but i also understand that this was another attempt and good one to be the first to make a movie about something one that really intrigues people you think mel gibson is a devout catholic please if you want to ignore all the rediculousness and pretend that it was made by indians for indians then you will get a lot out of this film just try and forget that ghandi is a white british man
really the whole movie sucks let 's start from the top the plot now as you probably know the plot has nothing to do with the game at all in fact the only thing remotely close they have is the name and the bfg the plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day you know the drill nothing horribly bad except for it does n't follow the game at all however this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on earth and now mars really first we have the kid who is horrible at everything he talks while he 's supposed to be stealthy he gets high on mission etc yes it 's his mission but i thought this was an elite military team not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training and portman not only is a moron but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he 's saying now as for genres for a horror movie it 's not scary at all not even a little suspense though i kinda wanted the characters to die so i guess that lost the suspense to me for an action movie well simply put there 's little to know action until the very end and yes there 's a first person shooter sequence towards the end but don t be fooled that is a gimmick and nothing more without spoiling anything i 'm just gon na say that the ending is incredibly generic all in all this movie is a waste of time and money
well this game i mean this movie is about there are a group of sorry do n't waste your time nothing to see even my boy after seen the movie decided to put the game on the shelf without finishing it
we rented this movie knowing it would n't be an oscar winner or anything i 've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books but this took the cake it was so lame ! we thought it would at least be entertaining no luck there the best part about it was when it ended what a relief !
during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood it 's not that doom is really a bad movie sure it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters it 's just a normal film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense and that 's it i 'm sure the movie would 've been big had it been released 10 years ago todays generation is probably sick of action films such as doom okay so it does go somewhere but the film is n't really designed to build to an creative story doom is the kind of movie you do n't really want to seek you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick action fix so you rent the movie watch it and then forget about it the next morning of course i 'm sure you do n't forget to rewind the tape because that 's impolite the rock never should have left wrestling it was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans and the rock means millions really miss him come back home rock please
when i first wrote a review for this movie i will confess that i was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell but upon further review i must take back my previous opinion and say that though doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie i believe that if the movie had been more original then i would have liked it except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original overall as much as i hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall sorry about my first review
after playing doom 3 the pc video game i had high hopes for this movie oh well the movie was disappointing were their monsters yup blood and guts yup swearing yup guns and special effects yup but after playing the pc video game the movie lacked a lot on storyline and it did n't make me jump as much as the game the movie is dark but that 's okay since it was patterned after the video game which is also dark although the game was much more playable '' with darkness than the movie was watchable '' the game was scarier too this says a lot about the game creators very well done and the movie directors poor effort i 'm not sure why hollywood could n't hack it it might be okay as a rental especially if you have n't played the game but do n't buy it honestly the movie to be just another alien movie however the game tells a very different
pathetic almost as bad as bloodrayne it would seem andrzej bartkowiak knew nothing of the game altough i did not go into this expecting it to be spot on '' with the of the game they could have at least tried to make the attempt the creators of doom the game deserved better than this movie
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd 's characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he does n't have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her is not like other people basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think blinks i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that 's it flat and mechanical
i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been film flip flopped time periods it hurt it 's will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole
do n't waste your time with this folks this movie is bad bad bad ! horrible acting stupid story prince directed it himself hey he ca n't be good at everything and outrageously ridiculous dialogue but a few of the songs are n't bad mountains girls and boys sometimes it snows in april and that 's why i 'm even giving it one star this is a really dumb tale about prince and morris day 's valet jerome benton going to france where the former is a gigolo who falls in love the one thing good i can say about this slop for the hogs is that it 's better than the graffiti bridge '' but if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for then go for it
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly was n't expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times
ok so first lets get one thing strait this is one of the worst movies ever and thats about so i really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and did n't even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and ella is singing alright that does n't even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down i really sugest that you do n't wast your time on this movie its not funny cute profitible not anything except bad its a wast of time to watch this movie
oh dear this movie was an abomination why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead i can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book 's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers but honestly there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal and the film design ! bleh ! maybe it would be appealing to girls but to me it looked garish cheap and really fake the costuming was slightly better than our high school plays and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated i felt so much dumber after watching this movie i feel like i need an iq test or a good book speaking of good books ella enchanted is one of my favorites i do n't know why i thought of that book just now i guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it but not much
i have only one question about this movie and that is why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book if you have n't read the book than you do n't know what i 'm talking about but if you have then you do i ca n't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would 've been if it had been adapted correctly half the time while watching this i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something the colors were so bright if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes locations characters and details from the story then everyone would love it not just 5 year olds it makes me so angry when i watch this movie yes its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing everytime i loan someone the book i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all in fact it is a hundred times better more even i am really disappointed i just do n't get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie than i suggest they do it right and if they do then i 'll be very thankful i just do n't get it the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better you would n't believe how much better it is i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book next time please please do it right
unfortunately i had already ordered these dvd 's before i logged onto the bar method website on the site there are news clips posted from old interviews etc i read one interview where she was being interviewed at her studio and the reporter was being givin a lesson via a tv segment all about her method when asked if this was all burr did to keep in shape she replied pretty much '' sounded like a vague answer to me the interviewer asked again later in the segment so this is all you need to stay in shape once again she answered pretty much seems to me if you were excited to share your program and sell it you would say im in great shape and this is all i do ! i have tired it once and you definately feel it the next day so we will see yvonne
like another reviewer my dvd 's were blank except for the producer 's i 'd really like to see the workouts but do i risk getting another set of blanks too
this dvd 's program covers the very basics of newborn care please note that the content is on caring for a newborn if your baby is already a few weeks old you most likely wo n't need this as you wo n't be able to learn anything new the dvd is divided into over a dozen chapters each cheapter is very short with a nurse or is she a midwife demonstrating newborn care techniques such as feeding swadding dressing etc she never explains in detail some of the intricacies in caring for a baby for example if a baby cries her heart out during diaper change what should a parent do in the end this title feels incomplete and unsatisfactory the bonus '' chapter on baby gear is a complete joke with the model quickly running through a list of things while pointing her right hand at each in the same way really annoying i would not recommend this video at all unless you are like i was completely clueless even then you can find this at your local library or on netflix
i purchased abc 's of newborn baby care '' and another video called bringing baby home '' the abc 's '' video uses a baby who is not a newborn the umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old the video does go over basic care of how to hold change dress a baby bottle cleaning and baths but skips over the details i would have found useful bringing baby home '' by the liandrea company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents no actors and covers a wider range of information i do not recomment abc 's of newborn baby care as anything but a suppliment to another video
i bought this dvd for my sister who is expecting i see that this dvd won awards but i do n't know how this video is cheesy and hard to watch i would not recommend this video it was not worth it
there are about 18 chapters of information on basic newborn baby care each chapter is covered in brief one to three minute sessions and there 's no depth in the information each content just scratches the surface of newborn care without detail information if you 've already read books or magazine articles on newborn baby care this dvd is not worth the money if you have not ready anything about newborn care books or magazine articles maybe this dvd can get you started with basic information as a new mom i have found that some information differs with information found in newborn care books and magazines and from prepared childbirth classes
this review will probably not be received with equanimity by most americans the movie by frontline focuses heavily on the fact that china is putting in a lot more goods thru walmart into usa at a much cheaper price than can be manufactured by american companies and that thousands of jobs are being lost all admirable points and no doubt true before we ask if walmart is good america '' in isolation in the much global '' economy that has been vigorously pushed by the so called economically developed nations over the last century shouldnt we ask has america been good the world 's economy '' as a whole in a national view considering yourself as a global '' citizen rather than just an american now all of a sudden when the technological superiority has been evened out in consumer products but the relative wealth level is still enormousl y lopsided it is unfair for those countries to sell cheaper by that argument it would have been unfair to even colonize america from the point of view of the native indians or unfair to sell arms for incredible amounts of raw in extremely uneven exchanges over the past 60 years with all the world nations global economics also has its cycle of evolutons and i for one am glad that extremely poor people for whom this is is pretty much a survival issue are able to raise their living standard a little as opposed to america where the problem of the poor '' the real culprit here is the corporation culture '' that the developed '' countries have created with th result that the top 1 of the population in the usa control 90 of the wealth this would have been a better dvd if it had not played upon the fears of a public in inflaming the chinese are taking our jobs '' model and focused on corporate greed of which walmart is only a single example in the usa i found the dvd amusing
this movie was arranged by walmart to counter the walmart movie the high cost of low price '' dvd by robert greenwald buy it if you want but when was last time you paid real money for a corporate you get that crap every day on tv for nothing
the movie the longest yard staring burt reynolds is an absolute masterpiece a movie that did n't need any remaking this movie the one starring adam sandler is a true shame to the original the movie could have been made better with anyone but sandler at the helm the inclusion of burt reynolds was a litter different do n't know if he should have even had a role in the remake was good for him to score the touchdown this movie did have some laughs but overall i do n't think that i see myself ever watching the travesty that is the remake of the longest yard i 'm off to watch the original and remind my self as to how much this sandler garbage ruined it brian bowe
from the people who brought you 50 first dates '' comes this synthetic remake of the 1974 burt aldrich crowdpleaser instead of a prison population we get caricatures and stereotypes adam sandler is far more convincing as happy gilmore than paul the wrecking '' crewe though a brilliant comedian chris rock has yet to find his cinematic niche the only bright spots are reynolds in the michael conrad role and courteney cox
once again hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that does n't need to be remade even with more colorful characters there really is no need for this ! save yourself time and watch the original
enjoyed leary 's rescue me and the job so much but was really disappointed in his stand up not funny and over done
why do you think leary does n't do live shows anymore hicks is n't around for him to steal material from ! and that is precisely what leary did he took bill 's material excised anything controversial and intelligent as in all of bill 's political work added more profanity to attract the ignorant and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator
this workout or should i call it that is composed of pieces of all different workouts put together there is no class no instructor forget about cueing no rhythm it 's horrible the abs part is even worse a kindergartener can do it 5 day abs yeah right i 'm an advanced exerciser and this workout is a nightmare trust me do not waste your money
it goes way too do like the abs workout section but the aerobic section isnt good i will never buy firm tapes agai
this must have seemed like a great idea at the time '' cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor '' the problem is his range is all the way from a to this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many chance '' happenings in the end all we get is this thriller '' and i use the term very loosely that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling
in the 80 's after cats became the phenomenon it became commercials for broadway musicals would often feature an audience member enthusiastically exclaiming it 's better than cats ! '' just from watching these commercials some of which where for stinkers like quilters it would appear that anything was better than cats this video proves those commercials right anything is better than cats what can one say about cats tony kushner sums it up pretty well when he has a character in his opus angels in america proclaim that it 's about cats ! singing dancing cats ! '' that 's pretty much all to it sure there 's a shoestring plot a tribe of cats have gathered together to decide which one of them gets to go to kitty heaven and get reincarnated or something and somehow it won the tony award for best book of a musical but cats is one irrelevant song away from a musical review about a dozen cats get a number about how special they are this one is a magician that one works on a train another is some sort of master criminal at random points they stop to dance irrelevantly and at one point have what a friend referrs to as a cat orgy '' taken at face value such an evening could n't be more than a train wreck but cats somehow draws you into it 's world for better or for worse in the case of this video however it is definitely for worse cats may prove magical in a live performance but this video falls to capture even a shred of whatever attracts the audience to it onstage the video direction and lighting reduces the magical junkyard set of john napier into a garish tacky vegas spectacular though some would claim that cats is little more than that to begin with and the choreography of gillian lynne highly praised in the original london and broadway mountings seems amateurish and ugly onscreen without the crucial distractions of good direction and beautiful sets the glaring flaws in andrew lloyd weber 's score comes hurtling to the forefront of the conscious mind repetitive overblown and dull i 'm not sure who 's fault this is the video director 's lynne 's or lloyd weber 's but it leaves a black hole in the center of the video you can do nothing but pity the poor actors involved some of whom are very good michael gruber dances well sings well and brings the right gravitas to the tribe leader munkustrap jo gibb and drew varley are an engaging pair of cat burglars get it and jacob brent has a fantastic dance turn as the magical mistofelees also deserving mention are the duo of aeva may and rosemarie ford who sexily croon macavity '' a jazz duet about a cat who is the napoleon of crime '' like nobody 's business best of all are two older members of the cast elaine paige as the tragic grizabella and sir john mills as gus the theater cat the old mills charms everyone off the stage and sings in a beautiful quivery tenor with an earnestness that brings a tear to your eye and paige the originator of her part belts out the one listenable song the famous memory '' with aplomb the third senior cast member ken page as the patriarch deuteronomy has little to do but sit and look magisterial which he does well but on the other hand john partridge shakes his tail as the rum tum tugger an elvis spoof without an inch of sex appeal and susan mckenna is cloying and cutesy as the motherly gumby cat few of the other felines make any impression however fine cats may be onstage and even that is debatable this video is a dismal failure capturing none of the magic and all of the silliness of musical theatre it 's things like this that give musicals a bad name if i were you i 'd pretend you are a mouse and run far far away from these cats
i ca n't believe that people have the nerve to compare this to the oringal one with chris tucker or even the second i watched this piece of unfunny white goofball movie and wanted to cry i really peeved me off that people had the nerve to say it deserved better or claiming that people were only bashing it because it was a black film but no it was horrible and seemed to need the touch of dj pooh and a return of chris tucker to make it funny this is just a crappy movie that needed not to be made sorry cube
i recently found this in a bargain bin for five bucks being a lucy fan i snatched it up and brought it home well all i can say is that i 'm glad i only paid five bucks for it on the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it 's due but on the down side the tranfer looks like it 's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of lucy but the shows almost make this dvd a good value bottom line ! buy it for five bucks any higher it 's a bad value
adam sandler plays a painfully shy man who has extreme fits of violent anger and has to deal with 7 sisters constantly interferring with his life he calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service this takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities the sad thing is i think there is probably a sweet poignant love story in this film but it 's buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog there is no reason shown why emily watson would fall in love with sandler it 's really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing i 'd rented another movie
this is the first movie review i have ever written i wish i could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire wait it gets worse i actually bought this piece of camel i am going to loan it to a prick at work that i hate ! no i 'll give it to him and refuse to take it back hurry go see it !
sorry folks but i found this movie excruciatingly painful to watch extremely boring
if you 're going to parody the countless number of straight teen comedies at least make your movie funnier and smarter than they are this movie is neither and does n't credit its audience as having any intellect whatsoever i have nothing against lowbrow comedy but the jokes and gags here are just plain tired is yourself to the point of constant crapping funny to anyone over the age of 12 jokes about gerbils and nambla c'mon i know i 'll get hell for taking my gay self too seriously but gerbil jokes and nambla being equated with being gay is offensive maybe if their respective jokes were funny i 'd feel differently but they were anything but just stupid if there is a redeeming factor to this movie it 's the attractive actors but that 's really it
even though i would agree that erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath '' story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true '' story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich 's story in the same way that the xena '' character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess '' though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman '' prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin 's boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy mules than on the personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and george who becomes erin 's the convenience '' factor is totally and for erin 's benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus '' check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with illnesses that the plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie not even slightly
this movie is not vulgar nor does it rate dont believe the hype check out pink flamingos instead now that is a vulgarly righteous movie by waters and the with the goddess of
i love and get '' john waters cry baby '' hairspray '' serial mom '' etc and i love the unique slightly larger than life elevated acting style he demands from his actors but this one left me cold uncomfartable and slightly nauseous i didnt even finish watching it i decided to rather take a dip in our local sewerage
i watched this movie all the way through only because i paid 22.00 plus shipping and felt i should give it every chance to redeem itself it is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings i would give it -10 ! ! rated r '' for what language adult content i have seen disney films more deserving of the r '' rating this movie was silly definitely not entertaining in any way and i threw it in the same bucket i put my dog 's crap in when i clean up the yard i am a chris isaak fan have all his cds and went to his concert on december 9. the fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately even his music i did not find the film offensive i enjoy hard core porn i feel this is a rip off poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone ! ! !
i gave it 1 star because there are no 0 's absolutely horrible no story line extremely bad acting boring movie from start to finish do not buy this movie the dvd cover is very inviting but there is no way i would even watch it on cable tv if i knew
enough already of this drug scene coming of age '' wannabes it has been done much better in johns '' and in showtime 's queer as folk '' brendan fehr 's performance is an embarrassment cookie who sends her brother out to get some sex is beyond belief this movie has nothing to recommend it no stars is my rating but thanks amazon for finding me a buyer of my dvd copy through my marketplace selling account
in fact i found it to be pretty much easily summed up with one
young queer skyrocketing out of the closet develops an infatuation for a stupid with predictable and stupid consequences both boys receive serious rue from the clue canoe sugar 's not half as titillating or erotic as you might suppose based on their flesh comingling on the bed in the cover art instead it 's a journey through the dark dank caves of el depresso the boys are cute and act competently they might have been presented a better script written by a sober writer i do n't want to see anymore movies about gays on drugs having lousy sex and sad lives
sugar '' is an interesting name for this strange awkward ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads while they carry the film over it 's editing direction and story hurdles they ca n't make up for its unevenness plus the story is entirely too cliche and i could n't help thinking it was essentially the same story as circuit '' albeit in a different venue except i enjoyed circuit i could n't get into this film why not the story lurches around and you are left to wonder why '' and how '' altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse something in the description of this film claims it 's funny i guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny then you will get a good laugh out of this i kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile not so much i 'd recommend circuit '' to anybody who might enjoy the and story lines and i 'd leave this film on the shelf it 's redeeeming qualities are few
really the whole movie sucks let 's start from the top the plot now as you probably know the plot has nothing to do with the game at all in fact the only thing remotely close they have is the name and the bfg the plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day you know the drill nothing horribly bad except for it does n't follow the game at all however this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on earth and now mars really first we have the kid who is horrible at everything he talks while he 's supposed to be stealthy he gets high on mission etc yes it 's his mission but i thought this was an elite military team not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training and portman not only is a moron but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he 's saying now as for genres for a horror movie it 's not scary at all not even a little suspense though i kinda wanted the characters to die so i guess that lost the suspense to me for an action movie well simply put there 's little to know action until the very end and yes there 's a first person shooter sequence towards the end but don t be fooled that is a gimmick and nothing more without spoiling anything i 'm just gon na say that the ending is incredibly generic all in all this movie is a waste of time and money
well this game i mean this movie is about there are a group of sorry do n't waste your time nothing to see even my boy after seen the movie decided to put the game on the shelf without finishing it
we rented this movie knowing it would n't be an oscar winner or anything i 've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books but this took the cake it was so lame ! we thought it would at least be entertaining no luck there the best part about it was when it ended what a relief !
when i first wrote a review for this movie i will confess that i was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell but upon further review i must take back my previous opinion and say that though doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie i believe that if the movie had been more original then i would have liked it except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original overall as much as i hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall sorry about my first review
after playing doom 3 the pc video game i had high hopes for this movie oh well the movie was disappointing were their monsters yup blood and guts yup swearing yup guns and special effects yup but after playing the pc video game the movie lacked a lot on storyline and it did n't make me jump as much as the game the movie is dark but that 's okay since it was patterned after the video game which is also dark although the game was much more playable '' with darkness than the movie was watchable '' the game was scarier too this says a lot about the game creators very well done and the movie directors poor effort i 'm not sure why hollywood could n't hack it it might be okay as a rental especially if you have n't played the game but do n't buy it honestly the movie to be just another alien movie however the game tells a very different
pathetic almost as bad as bloodrayne it would seem andrzej bartkowiak knew nothing of the game altough i did not go into this expecting it to be spot on '' with the of the game they could have at least tried to make the attempt the creators of doom the game deserved better than this movie
i have n't seen work of this quality since high school av class friends of ram dass will skip this embarrassing mess like first period biology too bad this story was n't entrusted to a more competent documentarian
having followed the philosphy of ram dass since the late 70 's i ca n't begin to express my disappointment at the director 's shabby work here was this a hatchet job on dass or was the filmmaker really this out of touch with his teachings either way it 's a shame that this unfocused piece of rubbish actually made it to dvd distribution
somebody put something in my drink or was it this of a film this guy directs like a trying to avoid creditors what a disgrace to ram dass 's legacy please avoid this film like the plague
i would love to have seen this subject handled by a more insightful and skilled filmmaker it 's regrettable that this tedious mess will be part of ram dass 's legacy
im a huge stone cold fan and i have got to say that i am horribly dissapointed this disc does not contain any of the good stone cold matches specificlly the matches during the ministry era luckally i rented this from blockbuster the main story is good but the rest i have seen in other dvds i was hoping for alot of matches it would take atleast dvd discs full of matches to really go deep into austin 's history but 1 disc is pathetic i put shame on the wwe as they have no idea what fans want this dvd was not even worth the rent i am a horribly horribly dissapointed stone cold fan and wonder how the wwe could put out trash such as this i hope the wwe releases a dvd set on stone cold otherwise i hope the wwe goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion wcw and ecw and have no motivation to become better
this dvd was a total disappointment first of all this video was a rip off of baby genius series but without the production value second this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits to be fair there are fruits and vegetables but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals grilled turkeys etc and rotten milk in other term cheese chicken period eggs ice cream i think it 's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream ! and other and foods this video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that 's bigger than baby 's head ! i believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition i would not recommend this video for vegetarians vegans or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits
the film has its amusing and even touching points but not very many the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters henry is just the kind of smug arrogant corporate ass that 's helped step on working people for real so it 's really hard to feel anything for him shot or not he 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is if you think about it appalling and his wife is in a way even worse she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up and does n't become normal '' ntil much later only their daughter has any heart at all maybe a better ending would 've been henry 's not making it bening going nuts from losing her stuff and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should 've been from day one barely watchable
this was a black comedy that unfolded over the first 30 minutes of the film revealing one surprise relationship after another until you realize that all the major characters are related in surprising ways it 's kind of strange because this movie was n't terribly complicated but i 'm still not sure what to make of it catherine o'hara has her two military sons scare her cheating husband whose cheating on her with drew barrymore the husband is successfully scared to death and drew barrymore is an earwitness through her headset at a burger joint i wo n't say home fries '' is a complete waste i was somehow taken in enough to watch the entire movie one shining light is luke wilson who steals most of the scenes he has and the crazy thing is that he 's stealing them from actors like jake busey and catherine o'hara it was the overall movie premise and plot lines that were average at best after the first 30 minutes of the movie you could see the direction the film would take overall this movie did n't know which way it wanted to go a comedy a drama a romantic comedy i 'm still not sure
neil peart is tired he gave us great music and influential drumming for decades this dvd is boring and looks more like what a kid does in his bedroom when he is just screwing around after school peart deserves the credit he gets for performances on albums like hemispheres permanent waves moving pictures exit stage left signals grace under pressure power windows and those tours but in my personal opinion the man has nothing left in the tank i have seen this solo done in various presentations since the hold your fire tour nothing changes tour to tour with the exception of the same parts being rearranged so if you want to spend an afternoon watching a guy warm up and going out of his way to do nothing then this is your dream package if you want to be inspired by drummers who go out of their way to bring something exciting new fresh and truly goes to the max with his playing then i suggest you look elsewhere
love michael buble but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience parts of michael 's head was cut off and then sometimes his whole head was cut off most of the time the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert that this was just home made videos this was definitely not worth 20 if you want a professional quality concert i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act caught in the act was worth the 20 bucks you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd also the sound quality on caught in the act was way better now i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it the dvd that i received was not enhanced anyways skip this one and get caught in the act '' instead
this dvd was the first one released by michael buble and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances there are segments of performances but the editing and fast wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect the performances get largely lost what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking clubbing gambling womanizing and generally acting like rowdy frat boys if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like i highly recommend caught in the act '' this dvd lives up to it 's name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster caught in the act '' is slick glossy flashy enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience i 've seen buble perform live twice and i can attest that caught in the act '' is just about as good as being there
i never recieved the dvd i bought from you guys im very dissapointed in amazon and the dealer i orderd this from i have been waiting for months for this dvd that i already paid for i had given up untill i got this e mail asking me for a review so i want either my money back that i already paid or my product that i nevr recieved i am very dissapointed in both please either send me a refund the dvd that i already paid for ! ! ! james young
for good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films but at the same time they 'd like an anime feel to their films what 's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing creative and powerful this film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it is n't this did n't have an anime feel which was n't really a problem for me i 've seen a number of anime movies which were serious but this movie was in my opinion about as horrible as they come trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about christmas how many damn movies do we have out there this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them a christmas story '' and all of those films far surpass both the quality and found within tokyo godfathers are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a japanese animation i doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great they were not but that 's beside the point since visuals are n't all that matters i doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original the only thing about it is the cast of odd fellow '' characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own except she is a transvestite really a man i feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it but i can only guess that they have n't watched very many christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately the director however is one of my favorite i deeply enjoyed perfect blue and millennium actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made after watching this movie though i 'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to cling '' onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table furuya was successful in taking a bland film creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again the audience bought it up too bad you do n't need to feel ashamed to say it really is n't as special as it tries to present itself as oh well perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film here is the film 's review by an informed reviewer i sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as unhelpful '' because they disagree with it then again that 's the style on amazon these days is n't it
this was so messy and dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion yuk ! partner and i were disgusted he and his deceased are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and for damn bad for your buddy it was obvious this was not quite of the caliber and challenging as some of herzogs past films we have been fans for years looks like he did it for the money and dorrington rode herzogs coatails in a way had just watched march of the penguins and wings of migration and those ! are truly documentaries made by film experts the babbling and rambling on in the white diamond made me pity herzog he did it for the yammers on and on in such a disgusting way i suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts hey cares about you out of california before you rot
this movie was a complete letdown they tried to cross cujo with the terminator interesting concept but the script completely lacks any real oomph awful film lance henriksen deserved better
i am truly shocked that there are people out there that thought this movie good and for saying it could be a reality i mean the plot of this movie is sooooooooo pathetic it was almost enjoyable to watch but the dog jumping the police cars and climbing trees swallowing a cat whole and turning colors so well that it became invisible were pathetic this movie would be enjoyable to those who like really bad films i would only recommend it to watch so you could see how stupid it is
this film just goes to show that when hollywood wants to make money they turn everyone into a tramp this happened to all involved in friend '' hardly an appropriate title i only hope the aspca stepped in sometime and sued because of animal cruelty and the film 's promoting of the perpetuation of cruelty to animals and i hope john lafia is real proud of himself he just sent the need for and recognition of animal rights back to the stone age only redeming factor was lance henriksen 's work he did the best with what he had to work with as usual
i received the dvd and it skips i was very dissatisfied i would have returned it but since i have never had a problem before i had thrown the receipt away patrice trace
opened the sealed dvd case and get shorty was inside and not the usual suspects i sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement i got a credit i think not sure i would rather just have the correct movie
mel gibson without question is a talented actor and he 's especially to action films but conspiracy theory is n't one of his better films despite the star power '' mel julia roberts patrick stewart the movie goes nowhere ct is like an episode though less interesting with a lot of action gibson 's character jerry fletcher acts like a throughout the first half of the movie of course he is proved correct but that makes his odd mannerisms rantings mumblings expressions etc all the more puzzling only a rational person could have put together all these puzzle pieces but he does n't seem rational at all if you met jerry fletcher on the street you 'd think he was seriously mentally the writers or director fell into the trap of trying to play fletcher off as a crazy person so as to give the story a twist when he is later vindicated this twist '' does n't really work it 's more than just mel 's character the whole movie lacks any sort of credibility movies about shadowy government or agencies and operatives either work well or fail miserably it 's a hard formula to get right unfortunately ct does n't get the formula right at all movies are about entertainment and sometimes to be entertained one has to suspend his knowledge about the way things really are to enjoy the fantasy world the story creates a good movie makes that easy for you the fantasy appears at least somewhat plausible conspiracy theory is n't one of those good movies '' the story its content and the way it 's played out is utterly ridiculous it has some suspenseful moments but you can get that from just about any hollywood action film ct is all action and no substance
i absolutely love the avonlea series that was on the disney channel i was very excited to learn that disney was releasing the series in a complete season format although the package does not indicate that it is closed captioned it is that was a must for me as i am deaf unfortunately the video quality is very poor and a lot of editing was done in most of the episodes i would consider purchasing from sullivan entertainment but their discs do not have closed captioning or even subtitles if you do n't mind the editing poor video quality or the sometimes out of sync audio then you would like it very much
i remember loving this movie and all of its silliness i recently made it a nostalgia purchase and is n't that great but my 6 year old loved it and continues to watch it all the time my child is now a weird al fanatic and i am ok woth that
i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance '' never had contestants who mastered it
parents and children who loved the other leap frog dvds about letters words and reading will find this one disappointing advertised as beginning math this one is mixed up in its focus spending quite a bit of time on recognizing the numbers from 0 to 10 especially zero and relating them to then quickly jumping to addition and subtraction without sufficient explanation or introduction of the concepts starting with simple counting by the end of the 35 minutes showing us ten times tables up to one hundred very young children will probably like the repetitive cowboy song and may even stick around for the acts and accompanying slapstick routines but the concepts advance too quickly for this age group kids who already know their numbers learn anything new from the beginning of the presentation but then again they probably learn anything from the rest of it either clearly one should not expect kids to learn math in 35 minutes which makes you wonder what they were thinking when they made this one a more sensible approach would be to have different dvds for each level as they did in the reading series so that they could spend more time going into the and making it fun this one is a rush job and was not properly thought out for the intended audience definitely not a tool you should count on to introduce your kids to math amanda richards may 4 2006
this dvd covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds ! it does not give enough body to the addition explanation and is hard to follow it was a pure waste of money
i like gangster movies and am from philly so i gave this movie a chance what a mistake the creators painstakingly tried to rip off the sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation it starts with the horrible theme song it 's obviously trying to sound similar to the song that serves as the sopranos theme but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it the cast is filled mediocre actors trying in vain to save a stupid script one funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent and with the exception of one guy no one can do a south philly accent sal mazzotta is trying real hard to be james gandolfini as tony soprano but i 'm sorry he may be a nice guy in real life but the guy could n't act scared in a graveyard at midnight and come on this guy as a gangster maybe as lurch in the adams family this movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work i mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking do n't they teach that in film school and usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot and at completely different angles for close ups like maybe the close up stuff was done much later save your money wish i could get mine back it 's been a long time since i saw a movie so bad i felt angry and ripped off for having seen it
do not buy this dvd as it is a total waste of money joe walsh can be heard on a much better dvd with eagles farewell 1 melbourne au this dvd does not have dts 5.1 audio format as advertised
i liked unscripted so i figured i could trust the previous work of the same creative team to be as good but that turns out to have been a bad call first episode was incomprehensibly dull it did n't seem to be about anything just a lot of dull inane banter and forced laughing it 's behind the scenes political stuff but only stuff that 's so minor and inane that i ca n't imagine anyone actually caring about it or finding it interesting i figured the whole series would follow suit and be about the lead up to the 2004 election so i was pleasantly surprised when the focus ended up being on other aspects of what the pr company does and the next couple episodes were actually about something those things being the sharing copyright infringement issue and whether the pr company should represent a saudi arabian organization episodes two and three stand out from the rest as being pretty interesting after that it gets a bit convoluted again a lot of the show is edited so you do n't know what 's happening while you 're watching it and you get to piece it together later to some extent when a later scene gives it context but about a quarter maybe a third of the content never slots into place the last episode is almost the most random of the bunch giving very little closure to the fractured plotlines that had been building up until that point the show i guess is very experimental the experiment being how little can you show and how can your editing be while still conveying a comprehensible narrative and in my opinion the result of the experiment is you ca n't push it as far as this show did when half the scenes leave you asking what was that about '' and trying to examine the details of what was said to work out which part was pertinent that 's more work than watching a tv program should be i feel like trying to find some entertainment value in any episodes other than two and three was a waste of my time
this show is so boring all it 's about is poltics what was hbo thinking having the one of the oddest shows out it does n't play no background music even when it 's going off and all the people do on that show is argue like petie little children in one episode i found very shocking to hear was from a blond hair woman saying the two oldest sons of saddam hussian that died they made their bodies into make up she said it 's so queer eye for the straite guy and another episode she call a gay a fag i did n't know she had that in her what i found weird was why would actor george clooney would talk what the show is all about during previews he has nothing to do with political things thank god '' never did get a second season
jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end the only mystery is in the details no real suspense i found the plot to be a little farfetched
i had n't heard much about this film before buying it slightly varying reviews but that was about it i thought being almost entirely set on a plane it might be claustrophobic and it was very ! i 'm surprised at jodie foster taking on this kind of role but i have to admit she did well in the role although she did n't have to stretch herself too far for the role it was very basic the thing about flightplan is that although the cast are good sean bean peter saarsgaard and erika christensen the plot really is n't up to much a child could have dreamt up this plot it 's very basic and it could have been set on nearly any form of transport and it still would have been the same it 's just cos it 's in the air that it makes it what it is but it 's very racist at the same time as jodie 's characters thinks '' she saw two foreign men across the road from her the night before getting on the plane and then she thinks '' on the plane they 're there and they kidnapped her daughter this plotline is started but never really completed and it 's just another plotline in a dizzying number of them the actors try to do their best in a film that has so many twists and turns you never know what 's going to happen next but flightplan goes one twist too many and by the end of the film you do n't really care what happens you just want it over and there are quite a few plotholes as well but it does n't really matter jodie should never have agreed to do this script and neither should sean bean the other two could have taken it or left it really it will make you feel claustrophobic if you do get claustrophobic on planes but otherwise it 's not really worth seeing
and it 's staring at you on the video cover it 's more proof of jodie foster 's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character when absurdity abounds in every scene no joke watch this with a old and have point out all the things in it that do n't make sense it 's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy watch it anyway because foster is always worth it but please hollywood let 's find this woman some projects that deserve her
this is supposed to be a black comedy in fact it is an ineptly directed unfunny obscene mess it features filthy language the required men 's bathroom scene rape racism hatred of america and ridicule of the mentally attention all altzheimer 's patients reiner thinks you 're hilarious watch harold and maude or even better little murders if you want to see black comedy this bomb is best forgotten i 'm not selling my dvd copy i 'm throwing it away
like a drag queen this movie is melodramatic wears too much is this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning i found this a hoot if this movie were in theaters people would be in tears laughing so hard ! ! one of the gems is when dolly 's controlling boyfriend drawls '' a man is supposed to go after the younger ones not the woooman ! '' put on a fake texas accent it works there 's the sappy sequence in which dolly meets with her mother looks at photographs of herself then gets a with her did thomas kinkade ever get directing credits of course one must suspend disbelief when the handsome young guitarist falls for someone somewhere they 're an archetypal have n't found that movie has a hilarious love triange enough melodrama for 10 lifetime films and songs to tie in with the plot no less ! it 's soap opera ! come 'an get it
i did n't see the show or i might have been more prepared for what i was buying saw the duration of the dvd and figured the listed songs must be extended versions so i put in the dvd and sat back planning to enjoy an evening of great music but then bruce began to talk and talk and then he talked some more yes he talked about the songs and the story they told he talked about his philosphy of life that was inherent in those songs and the stories they told had i not been expecting and looking forward to hearing him sing songs perhaps i would have been more interested in his outlook on life but frankly if i want philosophy i do n't go to bruce springsteen i go to tom cruise
by all means do as others here have suggested wait until the criterion collection version coming january 10 2006. for the wait for the criterion collection version ! thanks for listening
i ordered this mei ah edition and regretted it after the first five minutes of watching the visual quality is average but as anaguma reports below the english subtitles are execrable which is a grating distraction the good news is that criterion will be issuing a new edition in january 2006 if past performance is any indication it should be excellent
i ca n't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd this is a great movie do n't get me wrong it 's kurasawa after all my one star is for the people at mei ah who put out this dvd whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak english well enough to graduate from a level one esl class the subtitles are truly terrible sometimes bizarre and i thought at times i was dreaming i was watching a monty python skit alas i was not this was for real such a shame
got to the chapter before giving up on this confederacy apologist film sorry but do n't see slaveholders in a good light as a black female i will always root for the federals '' it took another 100 plus years for freedom for blacks in the south after the end of the civil war so i do n't really see the need for movies that show the humanity '' of southerners who fought tooth and nail for breaking up this nation so they could continue slavery anyway this is not a movie for progressive minded folks i 'm sure there are movies such as glory which are not on the wrong side of history nuff said
as soon as i realized who was in this film i knew how it was going to go its pierce brosnan playing james bond with another name in this movie he 's a rich guy thief with a thing for art of course he kept all of his uncanny charm from his bond roles if you wan na see brosnan effortlessly make fools of everyone like he does in every movie he plays in then this is for you personally i find it hard to care about a character that never has it rough
at first the show had some merit because the character of valerie was sympathetic as things progressed she became less likeable and the show 's writers seemed to get desperate it was like a bad accident hard to stop watching but left a bad feeling
the best animated comedies are funny on two levels funny on the surface for children and funny at a deeper layer for adults shrek '' for example was hilarious on both levels fully for the littles and hilarious even for us grownups alas robots '' has nothing for anyone over the age of oh eight not having a young child handy mine being away at college i am unable to say how funny it might be for the littles do not purchase this video expecting to be entertained yourself if you must purchase this video and a book your child can watch the movie and you can read
i 'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really was n't much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap '' you 'd expect from a family friendly movie though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just does n't do comedy all that well at least for a lead role jame garner the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character although the cast is a powerhouse on paper sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball an example there was a sequence when bret asks his friends who are standing behind him to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting which as it turns out they are unable to do instead jodie and james blow madly just like the movie this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like ''the three amigo 's '' on paper you would think it could n't miss but on film it 's painful to watch
set in 1986 ballad tells the tale of an ailing wealthy counterculture environmentalist jack and his teenage daughter rose living on an abandoned commune years ago it was prospering but all the members have left including jack 's wife and only jack and rose remained they spend their days in quiet contentment gardening farming and launching guerilla attacks on a housing development on the other side of the island living in near isolation jack and rose develop an incredibly close bond one that threatens to become incestuous terrified of this development jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend and her two teenage sons to live with them the new 'guests ' are an unwelcome development to rose 's life she 's incredibly possessive of her father and in retaliation for this intrusion she tries to seduce the two boys and kill kathleen the girlfriend jack is at wit 's end eventually things can not go on as they were nor can they continue to coexist in the new situation he has two choices neither of which are idyll this is where the movie goes awry the movie keeps everything to a very natural level no overwrought music and overreactions this works for most of the movie yet these events are too alarming for the characters to ignore after rose tries to shoot kathleen all the characters choose to ignore rose 's unhealthy jealousy they blame her behavior as wild the result of being isolated from society for too long and while this is the case it is also annoying the rose character is too much of a petulant child instead of a wild child as her acts became increaingly dangerous the more i wanted someone to finally tell her enough is enough the character of jack is equally unlikable he chooses to ignore his daughter 's unhealthy attachment and when he does fully accept it he continues to encourage it this may be a fully organic development of the characters and their relationship but that does n't mean it 's entertaining despite the controversial relationship the movie vacillates between smug and boring the performances are good my favorite are those of paul dano ryan macdonald and catherine keener as the girlfriend and her two sons there 's a naturalness to their acting that is oddly lacking in the depictions of jack and rose perhaps that is intentional jack and rose are not as much real people as they are idealized environmentalist versions of a fairytale king and his daughter living in grand isolation until the advent of the evil stepmother kathleen only in this case the stepmother is n't evil and the new family is more entertaining then the main characters there is an extraneous subplot with beau bridges as a housing developer that serves as metaphorical commentary on jack and rose 's reltionship but like the rest of the movie it 's too smug to be meaningful
the film starts out very promising an idyllic and relaxing flow through nature and natural housing that is habited by one member jack and his daugther rose alone in a world left with all the time to work and play and look at clouds in the sky unfortunately jack is having heart difficulties and worried by rose 's promise to die with him he invites his girlfriend 's family over to take care of them too bad his experiment in raising a completely innocent girl made her too innocent because now the arriving family is a threat to everyone 's sanity there 's quite a lot going on in this film as far as characters are concerned jack the person always trying to control everything around him so that it can all live harmoniously together has much more going on with his character than he realizes rose is blindly in love with her father even incestuously kathleen jack 's girlfriend is a normal person '' but she carries a severe savior complex her two sons suffer from being an overweight maybe gay hair stylist and a demented forceful every character in the film is painted distinctly and forceably creating drama and character development that goes into depths that it almost does n't even have to in fact this movie plays a lot like a first draft the characters and story are realized well enough but the rebecca miller never really takes them out of her head enough for anyone else to really share their experiences with them the story itself follows a certain arch with all the necessary continuances of beginning middle end climax and endouement character development and motivation but by the end of the film it 's quite clear that miller does n't actually know what the story is there would be a lot of symbolism mostly americana the fact of the matter is that every character quite easily represents a side of america an aspect that each holds dear and maintains even when falling into conflict with another aspect yet the overall thesis of the work is entirely lost it was starting to grasp its message at the end but then lost it in the epilogue this is a story about a bunch of characters that do stuff whatever the movie did have in terms of storytelling however was lost completely in the direction while the photography was pretty good and definitely gave enough lovely imagery to look at the camera itself never seemed to be put in the right place ninety percent of this movie is in for no other reason than that it seems miller did n't figure there was anything else to focus on editing and action is cut fast and frantically in an effort to hide the fact that the shot itself is n't really that important in all reasonableness this work does n't want to be a movie what it does have and what is basically the only thing one can fall back on is superb performances being that the characters are instrumental and that the performers are very good the overall grace of the drama is what sustains one 's attention enough to sometimes even forget that they 're watching something not completely developed yet in the end this is a performance piece not a film and makes a good rough draft to a work that may someday be fully developed
this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that i saw it in a free sneak preview by the end of movie you do n't like any of the characters and you do n't care what happens to them even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable the third time jack nicholson 's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you 're torn between wishing they 'd just kill him already and wishing they 'd kill you instead so you do n't have to sit through anymore of this crap save your time and your money turn around and walk away from this one i wish i had
what is the matter with fox give us a widescreen release wake up this is 2006. w i d e s c r e e n is what we want
based on my calculations this has 37 more short films about glenn gould than i 'm willing to watch
i like glenn gould i did n't care for this movie however 1 the actor does not look like glenn at all in my opinion which i find distracting 2 its very disjointed and a lot of the components offer very little insight about glenn or his life one scene was glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people 's conversations big deal this is not interesting i know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality but it 's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking another example glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady thats it why is this interesting someone could film my uncle in wal mart but would you care hey look my uncle carl is buying batteries now he is putting his change in his pocket how utterly profound in my opinion you will learn and understand more about glenn gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster uneventful movie
star rating above is for dvd only gave them an extra just for releasing the title movie itself i 've waited 7 years for this sidney lumet masterpiece to appear on dvd the transfer here is cruddy 12 total chapter stops for a film my review of the new burn !

undoubtedly the worst 'best of ' dvd ever made even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror but it ca n't be for the actual dvd there are n't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds shame on the band for putting this out obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'best of ' on dvd this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture my taped videos on vhs from mtv and sound and look better than these ones really this essay in amatuerism may have some interest for worse is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 's to 2000 'love is blindness ' 'walk on ' 'elevation ' and several alternative videos were edited out did n't they have another filmed version of 'gone ' mexico city 1997 was just a below average performance shame on for keep going with 'gone ' from that bad shaped bono 's rough night i still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song im talking about 'until the end of the world ' in case you dont know theres an actual video clip from that song rather they just put the well known sidney 1993 version here rumors say they 're going to release a dvd boxset by late this year i really do n't want 'remastered ' versions of shows we 've been watching for even 22 years rather i 'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage just in case here 's a list of several unreleased filmed concerts from early 80 's to pop mart tour i did n't include elevation because there 're 2 dvd 's out there from the same tour cheers belfast awesome concert ! berlin great goncert new york good concert hattem awesome concert ! roskilde awesome concert ! devore great concert goarshausen awesome concert ! dortmund awesome concert ! montreal great concert angeles awesome concert ! awesome concert ! awesome concert ! great concert awesome concert ! awesome concert ! great concert awesome concert ! baulo great concert awesome concert ! what the hell are waiting for
and this is from someone who thinks that music and lyrics are in the top echelon of rock music accomplishments next to those of led zeppelin bob dylan pink floyd nirvana let me be frank here these videos with the exception of wim 's spot and the footage from the 1992 gig are an evidence of total lack of creativity and spirit period
this movie smacks of quality unlike its two predecessors which are far superior blade iii is plagued with a poor script an unqualified director sorry david goyer is no director and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best trilogies in the marketplace think godfather iii in the godfather series and you 'll know why to bypass this awful film this movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the blade character in the first two films without these attributes the action and violence in the film an artistic staple in the blade franchise even lacks the emotional quality you 'd expect what you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters including snipes 's blade who are all dressed up with no where to go rated or unrated avoid this dvd at all cost it is n't worth the money or the effort
i found this movie funny in all the wrong places it seemed so to me this movie was atrocious it was n't particularly funny in any spots maybe a dry or dark humor for me the movie was terrible in the acting of the young girl '' the actress playing the part i 'm sure is a good actress but the part she had to play seemed lacking to say the least after the movie started i had to grab the box cover and check to see if she was playing a mentally retarded person i am not here to offend mentally retarded people at all finding out that she was n't supposed to be mentally retarded i spent the rest of the movie wanting to reach into the television and either shake her or slap her for acting so stupid and clueless spoiler alert coming up ! ! ! beware ! ! ! spoiler spoiler the funniest part of the movie was when the alan rickman character to his death ' the entire time he was running on the dock i kept yelling at the television that he needed to be wearing deck shoes or he was going to fall alas he did and i laughed and for the next 30 or so minutes i kept chuckling about that scene maybe in the end it really was a comedy i took my copy of this movie and sold it to a used book store for a dollar
i watched this movie on bravo one time and they were plugging it as a comedy unless you have a screwed up sense of humor this moive is far from that it 's very tragic but then again perhaps i 'm just and gullable i feel that i was mislead and i hate this film and will never watch it again
first let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie in many respects i live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats but this movie falls into the i hated this movie so much i could n't help but watch it whenever it was on '' category and now i love it i do n't know what it is about this movie i tried to put my finger on it many times i always have and always will hate sleepless in seattle '' which is a totally contrived load of crap but you 've got mail '' has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it 's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky skip around the neighborhoods of new york atmosphere it makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations it 's not just because of the meg ryan and tom hanks chemistry because i hated the despicable sleepless in seattle '' and always thought the entire premis of joe versus the volcanoe '' was a joke but in this movie contrived as it may be that interplay between the two works though their acting is also hammy at best i also love the contributions of greg kinnear parker posey stephen zahn and jean stapleton this is one of my guiltiest pleasures i 'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while i 'm watching it so i can jump inmmediately to the binford lumberjack finals '' or something like that but were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat i 'd never hear the end of it i love this movie there ! i admit it
ballroom and latin dance has come a long way even though many of the dancers on the dvd are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit this is not a great showcase this is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today but not the kind of video you will watch over and over the only truly spectacular dancing is that of marcus and karen hilton standard only they were then and are now quite amazing for those of us in canada alain doucet and anik jolicouer are on this tape briefly in the standard final
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out
this was arguably the longest 2 hours i have spent in my entire life it felt like much more i found myself more than a little angry with the overkill leadup to what could have been a compelling story the punch line took way too long to get to and when it came it just was n't enough to convince me it was worth the wait with each pregnant pause between dialogue and guitar strings i was sure i 'd be getting up to leave i suspect the invested time hours and hours it seemed precluded me from doing so i wanted that punch line then finally it came and it went this one had a ton of potential but it just did n't work for me
this was an unusual story unraveling as it progresses and memory returns feelings surface and it builds up to an ending that i am still not sure i care for
despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality this film is a complete the long '' scenes wedding russian roulette etc are much discussed usually either in the context of being essential for character development '' or boring '' in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills once he does try to move things along awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated to another you can see the reason for his procrastination despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth he really has nothing to say the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness by giving false and impressions of character and narrative but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything happen '' 2 stars is rather generous but de niro walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting albeit for such a misguided cause ultimately despite some controversy many of the film 's questionable portrayals of vietnam vietnamese america americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy
story about a man 's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star 's mother like that old dickie roberts movie it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars but does not do a good job of it mickey rooney and shirley temple where are you when we need you
there is an old saying if you have nothing nice to say say nothing at all but i feel compelled to critique this film partly because i really liked what i think it was trying to say follow your heart not what 's necessarily popular follow a bohemian lifestyle if that what makes you happy this film instead comes across as one produced by a major corporation to get us all thinking about heading back home to the suburbs because really what it 's saying is even if you have all the idealism in the world it will only land you in a ghost of a town like woodstock full of self doubt and hypocritical trappings first of all the acting was not bad i have no issues with the acting in fact along with the other fine actors in this film colin farrell should be angry their true abilities in developing characterization seem to be written directed and edited right out of this film there is little or no subjective viewpoint from these characters lives the viewer is left on the outside looking in wondering where these characters are coming from or what they are motivated by this film forces us to assume everything in order to believe anything without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel the way they do the effect is clear as the and director have apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs and masked sterotypes the only thing left to be certain the only thing that can be derived is that they truly do believe in hair color haircuts and stands a home at the end of the world '' wants us to believe it 's making a liberal statement wants us to swallow the whole enchilida by using home as a metaphor and a terminal disease to create sympathy for itself what this film really does is lead us down the road with good intentions to a home decorated in bad taste
i thought colin was sleeping at first i did n't realize he was acting sensitive '' it would be more interesting to watch paint dry than this slow boring pointless movie so his friend is gay big suprise and colin movies to new york to live with him and kooky girl who ever thought robin wright could look ugly she used to be an attractive girl i guess living with sean penn must be very stressful you probably guessed the plot kooky girl really loves gay friend but colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the unconventional life '' thats even more boring than living in the burbs '' they are the most conventional unconventional '' bores of all time either overdose on black coffee or skip this one for extreme colin fans only enjoy !
waste of time i turned it off the extra features '' were slightly interesting the actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing a vanity piece why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating melodrama do n't bother
thank goodness my wife and i rented this movie because it is a experience we are introduced to patrick swayze 's character and he seems the country hayseed who just got off the train from booniesville later we learn he 's been all over the world '' then we have to endure watching lisa neimi having or reliving her repeated emotional breakdowns boo hoo oh do n't forget george de la pena one minute he 's prodding the two former lovers swayze and neimi into dancing the production they 've all reunited to do the next he 's crying at his makeup table because he never believed he himself could complete the darn task oh please ! ! ! the story is so full of drama queens it 's beyond belief ! ! ! i have to admit that my wife and i spent most of the movie chuckling at the acting the story and finally the lover 's dance sequences my major complaint was we hardly got to see these great dancers '' dance there were plenty of waist up shots of the pair emoting their polarizing feelings demonstrations of their dance skill it seemed to be a case of hiding their weaknesses and then there 's neimi 's fatherless daughter it was n't too hard to figure out who 's daddy this plotline is so tired and comes at you thousands of miles before it 's revealed no surprise here now let 's be real the threesome who are supposed to be saving this dance company with their performance were all pushing their mid 40 's when we see the flashbacks of seven years prior ! ! ! now the movie is trying to convince us that not one but three people are going to beat the odds and are expected to perform like the kiddies ! ! as i said we had to hold back the giggles three things of note should be added here 1. watch the extra feature on this dvd neimi and swayze real life husband and wife show so much more of an emotional connection there than they ever could muster for the movie 's performance when not of the wooden variety their emotional range swung to a stupefying over acting again 2. the movie 's lighting director and photographer should have been fired on the spot miss neimi looks quite ancient and swayze looks like his face is plastic during one scene patrick wants to practice a ! ! ! we cringed because it was like telling us our grandma was going to make the same attempt we were convinced if lisa fell it would be the preverbal old woman '' breaking her hip again refer to the extra features they look quite pleasant and neimi looks like she may even be able to pull this wishing well story off 3. lastly i would say the sequences with the other dancers gathered for this movie were very good they were quite entertaining to watch and were performed with inventive choreography three cheers for the understudies ! ! ! hurrah hurrah hurrah ! ! ! i have mixed emotions about this film on one hand i like to root for the '' who makes good on the other it is tremendously embarrassing watching old people '' look foolish unfortunately my rooting turned to laughing in disbelief rent do n't buy this movie as ironic camp and for the intermittent supporting dancers ' sequences
i am sorry but i was unable to watch this product as it is not for australian viewing which i did not realise or understand at the time i have received a full refund for these goods but i would have rather been able to watch them thank you for your help and i wish i could have done your review iren
this pride and prejudice fan was hoping for a movie with a storyline much closer to pride and prejudice even colin firth could'nt save this one for me ! on its own i found it sadly lacking in just about everything i look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor if you are a true pride and prejudice fan i recommend buying the bbc series and the 2005 movie version both are excellent i would'nt waste my time again with this one
if this movie were set in the us i would 've given it 1 star but the british accent humor and colloquialisms partially saved it but not enough sorry to say ! why not because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth the desperately lonely and insecure single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a right here the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby clumsy and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing almost from the first 5 minutes this movie just reeks of audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled bits was there even one character in this whole movie do n't remember any maybe because i 'd like to forget this dreadful of a flick asap
i bought this dvd for some ideas for a routine for my dance class there were three sections of actual dance moves with instruction each set was short and fast there is no way i 'd want to see my girls dancing like this either ! ! there was more time spent on the behind the scenes and the freestyle which was bad too ! than on the actual instruction waste of money !
it seems like the actors did n't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts ! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot overly timid and shy captain wentworth is n't at all handsome or dashing and when they finally get together at the end it 's so awkward bland and unclimactic you wished you 'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book some people might have liked it but i definitely did n't to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice this movie could have been bette
i love jane austen 's works and persuasion for me comes next in line after pride and prejudice i think the story is more gentle and you really see a transformation in anne the movie however i just did n't like the characters were n't portrayed well and i thought the movie was boring anne in the movie had pretty much the same look on her face the whole movie which drove me nuts the guy who played capt wentworth i thought was too angry most of the time i really could n't enjoy this film because i could n't get over the bad acting i 'd love to see persuasion redone with hopefully a better result my advice read the book and skip the movie
apparently this is a film that many women who have read the book can make enjoyable characters including anne the captain display wooden acting others speak at a clipped pace the properness of the times allowed for personality as shown well in pride prejudice '' 1996 2006 but not here shyness plainness or slowness may be portrayed likeably with some personality both anne the captain maintain desperate looks constantly many of us do get nervous within romance but we are compelled by conversation and activity to interrupt our nervousness with personality thus anne 's the captain 's constant nervousness is all of us at the age of anne and the captain would have refined our nervousness to be responses of shyness thought distance hopefulness approval or alarm you understand the quiet thoughts because of the story in spite of the confusing paralyzed looks rather than because of them you come to like anne and the captain toward the end in spite of the wooden acting because of the story 's ending this film has pretty scenery such as walks along the ocean the costumes are often very unique and well done there is beautiful singing in one scene and even better wonderful singing over the closing credits good period romance films are so few and so desired that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is i applaud their positive imaginations however they continued their fanciful wishful thoughts into rating this film a reviewer who liked the film says she had read the book and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film a poor script for those who have not read the book awful directing made awful acting i would like to see this good story by a better director romance films are pride prejudice '' wives daughters '' north south '' fairly made is under the greenwood tree ''
this movie was not bill murray 's best i would not recommend it to anyone
i had high hopes for this movie alas it was a wasted sentiment it started off very it had a great premise an aging don juan gets a mysterious letter saying he has a son he may be looking for him so off he goes on a journey but can murray possibly have more of a complete stone face his complete and total lack of any emotion was appalling i kept waiting for this charming charismatic man who seduced woman after woman to pop out nope i thought this was a no comedy no drama in fact everyone in this movie acted with such stilted restraint in this movie it was painful very unrealistic people do not act this way the conversations and time spent with each woman he once had a relationship '' or one night stand we never know as they never once talk about anything much are boring and again unrealistic if someone i had not seen in 20 years showed up i think i might have a couple questions some animation either it be anger or surprise one other thing about this movie it feels claustrophobic tight constricted scenes drag on forever shot of him sitting on his couch staring 2 min shots of him driving down the road many of those with horrendous jazz playing dragging on for a minute just constant boring listless shots it got to the point if i knew what he was going to do say go over to his neighbors i would fast forward knowing it would be a boring drawn out walk over there i never ff through movies this one demanded it this really is a horrible movie i wasted over 2 hours on this only to have the end a total dud bleck
broken flowers '' is about as realistic as a movie with explosions gun fights and car chases in real life nobody acts like this or talks like this that 's not to say a movie has to be realistic to be good but it helps if somebody at least resembles a human being bill murray meets up with old girlfriends that he has n't seen for 20 years and these meetings are ridiculous in real life people show more emotion or have some type of reaction and they usually talk in this movie they just sit there and stare at each other with almost nothing to say why is this interesting it 's torture and when they do finally talk everything said is random and vague in reality people try to carry on a normal conversation even the strangest people do it i 've seen it people say the director jim jarmusch takes a minimalist '' approach nothing is spelled out for you '' you have to think '' if you do n't get it watch your explosions movie '' it reminds me of a modern abstract painting the one with a blank white canvas except for an orange square people rave about it 's deep meaning and it 's hanging at the met meanwhile i can paint an orange square on a blank canvas so can you i can also make this movie just give me some cameras a cinematographer and some money while watching in my head i was filling in the dialogue for the characters and my dialogue was a lot more interesting than anything these people say i enjoyed bill murray in lost in translation '' his performance worked there at least in that movie the characters had something to say and stuff happened here we have long shots of bill murray laying on a couch or just simply staring into space looong shots the only character that vaguely resembled a human being was winston bill murray 's neighbor he was somehwat amusing and he actually talked ! i do n't need movies to mirror reality to enjoy them nor do i need everything spelled out for me my favorite type of painting is impressionism which looks nothing like reality if you stare at it but with the right perspective a good one looks more realistic than a photorealistic painting with this movie an orange square is nothing but an orange square and people staring into space is nothing but people staring into space
what is the point team this film with the lost in translation and you have a five hour journey into total five hours bill murray wanders about with a sad look on his face accomplishing nothing and saying nothing of could call these two films odes to self pity not all souls are lost ! there are many people creating great things making wonderful contributions and being very funny at the same time and the people really want to see their stories instead these artsy farsty downers every year hollywood keeps losing 7 to 10 of its audience and these are two of the reasons people really do n't want to spend money to hang out with self absorbed losers with no point to their lives where are the frank capras preston sturges stanley kramers george stevens we need schlatte
i have to say that i am a fan of bill murray 's acting over and beyond his comedic work and i think that rushmore and lost in translation were efforts that should secure him in the canon of great actors but this film felt very misguided and took an awful turn at some point murray 's soulful silent stare was way too overused here cheapening the times he used it quite well in other movies and after he parts from his neighbor who is a wonderful character and helped balance out murray 's doleful depression the film just seems to bottom out and never seems to rise again jarmusch has had much success in the past in following very quiet interior characters but here he either overplayed his hand or forgot that what really made those other films work was counterbalance nobody and the french ice cream man are excellent counterweights in the other films to keep things from getting too dragged down but in this movie the counterweight is cut away from way too early and this film suffers for that mistake
i ordered this dvd on the basis of some of the reviews it was a big mistake while terry dunn is very relaxing to listen to and obviously knows his stuff the quality of the dvd makes its all but useless as a training tool the dvd does not permit selection of the section i want to perform the section that introduces you to the basic forms is so washed out that you can not tell what the foot and hand positions are supposed to be finally in the last segment where terry performs the complete form the camera pans in too often so that you can not actually see the form from start to finish sadly i highly recommend you seek another source of knowledge for this wonderful art i know i will be looking for something better
i ca n't believe that people have the nerve to compare this to the oringal one with chris tucker or even the second i watched this piece of unfunny white goofball movie and wanted to cry i really peeved me off that people had the nerve to say it deserved better or claiming that people were only bashing it because it was a black film but no it was horrible and seemed to need the touch of dj pooh and a return of chris tucker to make it funny this is just a crappy movie that needed not to be made sorry cube
i was disappointed in several aspects of this dvd first of all if you are an avid watcher you have probably seen most of these segments secondly the cake on the case front is not shown or demonstrated on the dvd thirdly the wedding gown segments are virtually repeats of one another showing the typical silhouettes of wedding gowns and recommendations of figure types for each
i posted this originally under wow this sucks '' i may have been a little harsh i am still disappointed with it as i had high hopes when i caught the tail end of the performance on tv but i think i saw his first bananas '' its not that there are no funny parts there are a few but its that his material is not really fresh and original its been done before and done better particularly arguing with his puppets and some of his general observations that start the show and i really did n't care for his i will say that his puppet symphony at the end is a killer segment i did laugh really hard at that i guess if i could change my rating it would be a 2 out of 5 instead of 1. check out the jeff allen bananas '' dvd he is funny orginal and the story of his life will bless anyone who watches it
because i have regular working rounds at marvel i heard there that the company was never happy with this animated show mostly in the change to having most of the charecters as teens and only logan was to remain as an adult was a compromise made between marvel the animation studio that made this show and the wb network avi arad was never happy with it and after three seasons decited to cut the show out of it 's contract even though there were more shows ready to be made since it did not fit in wtth marvel 's future projects it was made a lame duck and voted out of office to use a political saying
combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial lots of guitars and vibraphones let 's call it rock on with nawsa '' this film tells the viewer much more about hollywood femnists ' perceptions of the past than it does about the past itself all decked out in edwardian costumes the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the progressive era these scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement yet after being exposed to a few suffragist she too will take up the banner and join the nawsa crusade perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when alice told a washington post reporter i 'm having dinner with helen keller '' the reporter do n't stare she hates that '' yet i suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music rock is not only inapposite to the it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns indeed one of the few songs the producers chose from the early century was ai n't she sweet '' a roarin ' twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by paul ash his orchestra at the oriental theatre in chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as eddie cantor and sophie tucker alice paul was hardly a flapper nor was she an astute poitical strategist she was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater much more productive efforts of carrie chapman catt angelica huston and others who had continued the struggle since seneca falls in 1848. catt used paul 's antics to good effect in eventually persuading president wilson here woefully overweight to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the great war paul was at most a footnote in the process i showed this film to my gilded era class last spring consider a few written comments from today 's undergraduates disjointed '' historically inept and '' this was hilary swank in insomnia part 2 '' numerous historical inaccuracies included women 's hair and men 's clothing styles from later eras the misuse of props like a small woman 's wrist watch and a crown graphic press camera both of which did not exist in 1918 plus the american flag behind wilson is hung backwards '' the parts where she was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by speiberg but his was more convincing '' my favorite why not really screw it up and throw in a little helen reddy at the end
complaining whinning mumbling beer drinking bathtub soaking unattractive alison and her overgrown teenage hairstyled beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter the most horrible series i 've seen on tv in the end alison seems to solve '' whatever the problem is but it 's not worth the watch no one in my family enjoyes this show
i really enjoyed 's earlier films but they keep seeming to get worse and worse the dude kicked like 3 times in the film the best part of 's films are the fight scenes and these sucked you know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap ! i 'm really hoping he 'll get with steven segal talk about how much they both suck watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots
van damme will keep making these awful pictures until fans like me quit buying them i quit the shame is that his new movies are most likely watched by his fans and yet very little in them appeals to fans imo why
again as a van damme fan i 'm disappointed the hard corpse is slightly better than second in command but still boring and cheap failing to hide its low budget sheldon lettich directed both lionheart and double impact arguable two of van damme 's best movies as well as the enjoyable if a little silly the order so what happened with the hard corpse the plot is predicable boring and full of stereotypical characters terrible acting and all wrapped up in a cringe inducing script as one reviewer noted below this is basically a cheap rehash of the the bodyguard with van damme playing another boring zero emotion personality void haunted past character that he seems to be drawn to lately as bad a thing as it is to wish upon anyone i preferred his performances when he was coked out of his head on illegal narcotics of various types at least he was entertaining ! another irritating annoyance with this movie is when characters some ex trained us marines fail to take any cover during the shoot outs and when will people learn that cars are not bullet proof they may as well have a sign on their heads saying look at me i 'm going to die next '' van damme then runs over to them after they have been shot so he can do his little bit of acting where he shows his fans that wonderful new acting technique giving us his new facial expression of looking mournful and pained over the death of his friend that unfortunately comes across more as if van damme is trying to take a dump as for van damme 's fight choreography it has now entered the realms of the ridiculous van dammes character is a trained killer but he ca n't block a punch or take an opponent with no martial arts experience the character van damme is protecting is the former heavy weight champion but ca n't knock van damme out even after hitting him square in the face several times without gloves van damme 's fight scenes are now filmed much like steven segeals all you see is legs and fists flying at the camera or hitting opponents with some close up camera as tight as possible grappling were you ca n't see van damme 's face i wonder if van damme is now using a stand in or double for his fights because you very rarely see him doing any actual martial arts i 've said it before and i 'll repeat it again someone please give dolph lundgren more than 5 million to direct and star in a decent action movie because he has shown lately with the defender and the russian specialist that he takes pride in a movie that he has control over in short in my opinion this is another disappointing boring entry from van damme with very little martial arts unexpected below average directing from sheldon lettich with no entertainment value to recommend to anyone except hard core van damme fans and even they will probably be disappointed definitely rent before separating with 18 's dvd unseen
i am one of the biggest van damme fans and his movies continually let me down of late the current case in point is the hard corps if you have seen the bodyguard kevin costner and whitney houston you have seen a much better movie than this low budget rehash the movie 's plot actor 's performances or lack thereof and the poor dvd package only special features are other movies and not even the trailer for this movie make this a rental only van damme plays an from desert storm and he is hired to be a bodyguard to a former boxer now community leader he does n't want van damme 's protection but his sister does played by vivica fox what happened to her since kill bill there are some fight scenes involving a rap mogul yes how could anyone make this up whom the boxer had sent to prison years earlier now that he has been released shootings and house attacks sum up the plot van damme is playing very low key lacking the charisma he showed in his youth he is not bad but not good either for fans looking for a lot of martial arts you wo n't find it a few punches and kicks but nothing any more spectacular than what he did in second in command if this is the best van damme can do these days i suggest a retirement then maybe when he is in his 50 's he can come back like arnold and sly who knows do yourself a favor do not expect anything but a action film
all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane 's life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane 's life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane 's extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan 's heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful series bob crane 's professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane 's secret life '' and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane 's private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan 's heroes television series
i was optimistic for greg kinnear once he was very funny ragging on soap soup he usually plays the second banana in film or a man dying of aids auto focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960 's tv icon hogan in hogan 's heroes the replication of the original cast is a bit eerie after all these actors dress up as german prison guards a chill goes down my spine but hogan 's was a comedy which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny ss guys anyhow bob crane played hogan for six years and kinnear badly imitated yes i 'm sorry to say kinnear is awful as crane which puts a damper on the here 's a disc jockey with 60 's patter on the air with an all american family a loving wife and cute kids they live like ozzie and harriet in the la burbs going to catholic church on sunday crane lands his big break falling for the trappings of fame most people fall for the trappings of fame read the supermarket check out magazine racks so all of a sudden crane 's garage porn collection is n't enough women very beautiful hollywood women find crane and his buddy william defoe irresistible the birth of the video camera comes into play the trouble with the script or maybe it 's the cardboard way kinnear acts we watch but in the end we do n't care
one of the worst war movies and one of the worst vietnam war movies ever if you want to see a better one made at about the same time see burt lancaster in go tell the spartans '' if you ever wonder about how clueless some people can be about history and world events this should pretty much explain it
this may be the goofiest war movie ever made an attempt to do a flag waver smack in the middle of the vietnam war simplistic and cliched beyond words badly directed and acted the central part of the picture is nevertheless worth the price of admission a long sustained night attack on a firebase is memorably staged and shot seems a little clunky now but no one had ever seen anything like this when the movie came out the rest is laughable especially the mistakes wayne parachuting out of plane without hooking up smashing what is obviously a mattel toy against a tree see the curved magazine '' and of course the classic ending where the sun sets in the east
i ca n't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got the acting is laughable as is the writing there are also many mistakes and inaccuracies ! they depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys real life is n't like that i guess just because this movie is people automatically back it up but this is the worst movie i have ever seen
ignorance and propaganda run amok a good movie for a lot of american dumb guys who like war movies just because they 're war movies the nazi 's made films like this in the 1930 's with the poles portrayed just like the vietnamese are in this film the vietnamese boy in this movie is named ham chunk are you kidding me the sad part is no they 're not kidding which makes this movie all the more revolting but i see it 's quite popular which is informative as to how george bush got into the white house and why american soldiers are now bogged down in iraq the same war mongering fat heads who did n't get it '' understand the consequences of putting your big american nose in other people 's business then do n't get it now winston churchill warned those who do not remember their past are damned to repeat it '' a fine vintage vietnam war movie for simple minded viewers remember freedom is not free freedom to make millions of dollars from selling weapons and war materials to the government costs citizens billions of dollars this movie stinks unless your sophisticated taste enjoys war as
this has not aged well the scripts are silly the acting is of the chewing up the scenery '' variety gale storm no longer seems cute she comes across as annoyingly perky spend your money on something else
the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo apparently supernatural who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as do you believe in ghosts '' the lighter '' scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in yet the polar express '' still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children
chris van alsberg 's beloved christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent outrageously overblown animated film the characters are bland and their movements are creepy and mechanical both of which make them feel more like robots than humans the film 's biggest problem is that it dose n't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie a children 's christmas cartoon or a slapstick comedy the film overflows with ideas for instance there is a mysterious who makes his home on the train 's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys it is not an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy as many other reviewers have while not quite the ''cat '' astrophe of the seuess films the polar express is still something of a train wreck
along time ago i saw this in the theater and found it interesting how the painting of the chapel was done however it was very slow moving for a teen ager now that i 've grown old 63 i could hardly stay focused on it at all if you are interested in purchasing this movie i warn you it will be painfully slllooooowwww think of it as the agony not the ecstasy '' sorry heston but its true i still think you 're the best your friend jef
i ordered this dvd for my husband who is teaching a world history class at a local high school we love the movie itself but the quality of the product was there were several times during the movie when there was an annoying scratching sound that would continue for a while i thought this was a new dvd and not a used one but the annoying sound during parts of it causes me to wonder about that the speed with which we received the dvd was right on ! he did get it in time to use in his class so that 's a plus just wanted you to know about the quality of the video itself
ugh an unfunny waste of an hour and a half even the dvd menu screen is painfully annnoying this film boasts 2 awards on its cover one for best film at the vail film festival and one for best actress in the comedy arts festival it is so bad that henceforth mention of either of those two festivals will be a black flag when i 'm deciding what not to watch before the third act even started i emailed the good people at the vail film festival to find out what other films were there in 2004 when this won because i 'm a masochist and i 'm utterly fascinated to find out and yes ultimately watch the kind of trash this movie could have possibly beaten they have yet to reply i can only hope that if andy richter knew this was the kind of work he 'd be doing he would have shackled himself to conan 's desk saw '' i had a running debate with myself whether bryan cranston 's character 's obnoxious foreign accent was in the script or if he added it in a futile attempt to spice things up said debate was far more entertaining than the film highlights for me were two moments of sheer confusion and panic which required me to look up the cast credits online to reassure myself of my own sanity dear god is that supergirl '' and dear god is that the lead singer of korn '' other than that the best feeling this movie gave me was relief when the end credits started to roll less than 90 minutes after the opening credits not only do i wish i could assign a score of zero stars i wish a mechanism existed which would allow me to take away the stars given to this film by other reviewers and dispense those stars equally among gigli empire records catwoman and tom green 's filmography in its entirety
this film is a tough one to review the film itself is amazing so therefore i should give it high marks the problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature as if we came from outer space or something that is a bad and dangerous message and so i feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that amazing footage but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats how many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams pollution and over fishing that destroy the bears food source how many grizzlies kill humans how many cars kill humans should n't we all be more scared of cars i agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and we can with nature but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it native americans whom we also destroyed with them for thousands of years they respected the grizzly this guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns treadwell was very conflicted and troubled not that we are n't all troubled not that we all do n't deal with failure and disappointment not that a good rant does n't make you feel better from time to time but he had a death wish and this was really just suicide by bear the way i saw it am i the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality lastly in some of the interviews well they were just weird and contrived like they were acting these weird people in this film do nothing but harm the cause
season one is simply not his best season i 'd recommend another one if buying this for the first time
i am one of the many reviewers who purchased this dvd because everyone favorably compared it with seinfeld '' and not being an hbo subscriber i had never seen it personally i found this show boring repetitive and often grating well that 's just me you might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy deciding if this dvd is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste buy this dvd if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters as in married with children '' or vicki lawrence 's show mama '' this is not the kind of funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in all in the family '' as in seinfeld '' you will see adults act in childish selfish irresponsible uncaring ways depending on how this is done it can be very funny but curb '' missed the mark for me i find new yorkers as those portrayed in seinfeld to be funny but californians as in curb '' are just pathetic not even laughable you might feel differently neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in seinfeld '' but almost celebrated in curb '' the characters in seinfeld '' are roughly half a generation younger than those in curb '' the seinfeld characters who came of age in the me '' era of commit a variety of hilarious gaffes and associated with a lack of direction in life the older characters in curb '' on the other hand offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life they merely exist you might find this funny but i found it depressing

controlling the pool of her film scripts and directors in whatever kulture of mass entertainment media manufacture poor animation bereft of ideas and recycling a lunatic zoo escapade from earlier motion picture for the purpose of catholic bashing and youth corruption ecstatic performances are actually religion related catharsis for motion picture redundancy it only amounts to acting out the

propaganda speaks for itself and only provides test cases for subversion analysis in hazardous media appliances of mass population psychological operations and that is actually more entertaining that viewing any movie completely prone to its presumptive it is n't a big important celebrity it is n't a big exciting new picture release it is n't even a story or film making it is a method of

sticks out like the sore thumb it is boycott such movies burn your copy of them instead of the flag for the evening news cameras be more critically selective of the means to protest so that it does n't ring hollow procure movie bills big and fancy and symbolically destroy them even make movies of those effigies and put them on the web fight back evict the deliriously self infatuated patrician media cast and all its pseudo sophisticated mundane messages of inhumanity they are destroying america any way they can
as the product of a catholic education i really wanted to like this film but i intensely disliked it 90 of the reason that i disliked this film was because of the young actors they are absoutely terrible and annoying actors playing terrible and annoying characters ! they provoked no sympathy or empathy whatsoever for the characters they portrayed
i loved the fact that you can program your fitness segments but this tape should be labeled just for beginners the toning segments did n't fatigue my muscles and the cardio i barely broke a sweat if you are a beginner this is a great video to start with they only do 6 reps for weights most of the time and the cardio is not too hard to follow or too hard to do in all 5 stars for beginners 2 stars for
i like that you can customize your workout or use a pre programed one there is the option of only having music and no talking which is nice the cardio segments are about 13 minutes each and the toning segments are about 5. there is a total toning segment and it is about 10 minutes the cardio did n't get my heart beat elevated like some other dvds i have the toning segments had good exercises but my muscles did n't feel tired after doing them i think this dvd is geared more towards beginners
i travel for work so i often rely on fitness dvds to help me stay in shape i 've only been working out seriously for a few months and this dvd is definitely too easy for me there are 2 cardio workouts 5 toning work outs a warm up a cool down and an all over toning workout this seems great but when you actually look at the details you 'll see that the cardio workouts are only 13 minutes each and the toning workouts are only 5 minutes each so when you actually look at the workouts without warm up and cool down you 're only getting about 20 minutes of real exercise i would say this is a good dvd if you 've never exercised or you are really out of shape but even if you 've been exercising for a little while you 'll probably find it too easy i strongly recommend the method cardio bootcamp or 10 minute solutions carb burner or 10 minute solutions pilates all three of these videos will give you the ability to choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into a longer workout if you 're looking for a good toning workout try self bikini ready fast
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
there 's a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel '' it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one her acting debut i 'll be there '' is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so seventeen years ago paul kerr craig ferguson of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert fast forward to the present kerr discovers that unknown to him his ex rebecca jemma redgrave gave birth to a daughter olivia charlotte church who is now a paper girl the problem is olivia has been kept a secret from her dad rebecca is embittered but kerr wants to get to know his daughter and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father music seems to be the thing that will bring the girl and the rocker together but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler who despite being only in her twenties has had an immensely interesting life well maybe someday she will get a biopic because i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way it involves a rock star and his daughter otherwise it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting with a forgettable script not much humor and a goofy premise the movie does n't have a lot going for it it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy scripted for church to act out and not a terribly interesting teenager either it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet as for acting talent she is bland at best but she does perform some good songs and her voice is as pretty as ever just watch the songs and her actual scenes redgrave does as good a job as she can and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker his is the only memorable role in the film and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film also known as the britney spears approach i 'll be there '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can
the story was awful do n't spend your money on this one borrow it from the library
i wish i had heard about the versions coming out in 2007 before spending a dime on this one the picture is no better than before and the sound may actually be worse i hope this film gets the treatment it deserves it stands out as one of the greatest science fiction films ever not a space opera like star wars or trek or cheesy alien but true brilliant thought provoking there are all too few films like this one treat it with the respect it deserves
this was probably the worst royal rumble in history it featured three very bad matches one decent one a lousy royal rumble and an absolutely amazing match brock lesnar big show royal rumble qualifier this match was absolutely awful the big show is a decent wrestler but brock lesnar is absolutely terrible a predictable ending made this match all the worse this match is like watching a tumble weed the dudley boys c william regal and lance storm this was a fairly decent match regal and storm are very good wrestlers and in the tag team forum the dudleys can hold their own its sad though that this was the second best match on the card nice surprise ending though torrie wilson dawn marie if you take out the fact that torrie wilson and dawn marie are very nice to look at this match is worthless unless you are really bored dont even bother watching this triple h c scott steiner triple h did all he could to save this one but steiner really cant wrestle anymore i remember back in the early where scott steiner was one of the best wrestlers in the game now he can hardly even move this match really isnt worth seeing yet its still better than some of the other matches on the card kurt angle c chris benoit there is no way to fairly describe this match it was outstanding phenomenal amazing incredible brilliant these two guys know how to wrestle and they put on a clinic this match is easily one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time and shows that you dont need steroids and steel chairs to put on an amazing match angle and benoit are the two best wrestlers in the business and this match is proof 2003 royal rumble match this match was decent alright there werent any really good spots it was fairly boring all the way through and highly predictable it got a little interesting when the final five were in rob van dam kane undertaker batista and lesnar unfortunately lesnar is an awful wrestler and he looked pathetic out there with other talented wrestlers a guy like brock should never be in the royal rumble it 's sad when the worst wrestler by far in the match wins its sad that an event with one of the greatest matches of all time gets only a 2 out of 5 rating but theres nothing much to watch here other than as i said the rumble was poor the undercard was weak and several of the matches were downright awful the benoit dvd has the match buy that this isnt worth your money
this movie was nowhere near the original so should you wish to watch it do n't expect to be in stitches the whole time i honestly like it less and less each time i watch it which to me is a mark of a bad movie it does have it 's moments hence the 2 stars it is after all bill and ted it has to have moments ! my suggestion is it before purchasing it if you love it buy it if not do n't
the movie is great the dvd is not the french soundtrack does not play properly i had to return it for a refund
i really do n't know what all the hype has been about i kept hearing all these great things about this movie so i eagerly anticipated watching it although robin williams gave his usual great performance i was unable to connect to any of the main group of teenagers i was also greatly disappointed in the fate of one and then the repercussions that creates on robin williams character there is probably alot of really deep things i did n't catch since poetry is usually too obscure for me another reviewer thought the ending was brilliant i really saw no value in that final moment i certainly did not finish the movie with a good feeling i felt quite relieved it was over
i saw this movie in the at a porno theatre on a double bill the decline of western interesting through the movies middle aged men would furtively enter watch the screen for minutes and go to the other 'm not sure that they did n't have the right idea there are indeed wonderful clips of live clash a wonderful band but most of the movie follows the mind numbing adventures of a moron who somehow falls into a job as a roadie for the band members themselves later largely disavowed the movie and it is n't hard to understand am a rabid clash fan but there 's no way that i could justify paying the price for this movie just to watch minutes of the is a tragedy that this band one of the most exciting bands in the history of rock does n't yet have a good concert film joe strummer 's death may cause the surviving band members to go through the archives to put together a documentary that shows the band performing that happens i guess this is better than nothing but not much mick paul do you read these reviews your fans deserve better that this ! whip out a real concert movie
the premise grabbed me it is about a gay man sent to the concentration camps during wwii i was expecting some really good things from it gay entertainment '' as well as having the nazi attrocities against gays highlighted for starters to say i was disappointed would be an understatement it 's a bad sign when i wished the ss would just shoot the main character and make it a movie about his boyfriend instead ! i despised the main character he was everything i could possibly dislike about a person all rolled up into one he 's a cheater on the same person a a jerk very promiscuous makes unwelcome decisions for other people throw in some domestic abuse and you 've just about covered it he 's someone i 'd be ashamed to know needless to say it was impossible to sympathize with his wretched character and i ca n't say i 'm happy with the clear stereotypes of gay life '' being portrayed from the very beginning
i might try to kill his for dropping this trash i saw this garbage not too long ago and this is by far the worst stand up comedy i ever saw jamie foxx is a talented actor and thats just about it i didnt laugh one time and i was half drunk watching this i cant believe he actually gets paid for this i should be paid for watching this amazon really needs to bless us with a zero star option because it is most needed
jamie foxx is very talented as an actor but he does not even hold a candle to the top comedians if you watched this and thought it was funny then do yourself a favor and see more comedians foxx 's routine gets put to shame by the big names in the industry if you are just a jamie foxx fan and want to see him perform then by all means by this dvd but if you are searching for a quality comedic routine that you can laugh at look elsewhere
i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it was n't his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all
let 's face it some of the jokes are funny the one about mike tyson been like someone else 's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny i also found the bit about bill clinton and osama bin laden also funny however jamie dwells too much on the fart joke how can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes after 2 min it becomes worn and so unfunny '' why does he repeat himself so much with that line i am not saying she 's a crackhead just a bit crackish '' it sounds very rehearsed after the second time if it were only for these errors i would have found the jokes altogether acceptable what i found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against arabs i am black myself but found some of the jokes about islam and arabs to be in bad taste jamie could not even get an arab accent right c'mon guys the accent jamie pulled was an indian accent and not an arab accent i kept asking myself what would black people do if a white comedian say robin williams makes the same crude jokes about black people '' would it be acceptable '' i think not i am sure the black press would slaughter robin if he did i wish to call a spade a spade nonsensical crude racist jobs against any ethnic group black white asian and yes arabs are not funny they degrade and demean for not even managing to get an arabic accent jamie deserves 2 stars from me
i havent gotten really really good and angry at a movie in a long time and of course it took a film like troy to remind me what it was like let me start by saying that if your idea of a good time is brad pitt and orlando bloom slightly misted in sweat and looking pretty then turn the sound down grab a bowl of popcorn and by all means enjoy this movie and the beautiful costuming and ignore the rest of this review but if you expect even one iota more out of a movie waste your time 'm saddened by the fact that i cant get the 2 hours and 40 some odd minutes of my life i wasted here back the dialogue is insipid they actually left the line i 'm sorry sir your wife has left with the trojans '' in the film everyone speaks with a british accent except brad pitt would n't be that bad if he wasnt the star of the film and then there are the extras who play sailors for reasons i cant quite understand seem to be speaking greek the rest of the greeks are speaking english with a british accent except brad pitt in one scene achilles pitt and his cousin sparr with swords among majestic greek ruins next to a beautiful blue sea i actually hit pause to scream at the screen idiots ! ! ! it would have been a building then ! not ruins ! '' the real trojan war lasted over ten years filmed version appears to last two weeks with a days break here and there to allow the main characters to look suitably attractive on the beach and you have very little if any idea of the loss of life on each side in short this movie is pure unadulterated drivel youre asked to care about what began the war you do n't you 're asked to believe brad pitt 's achilles is smoldering and brooding you ca n't and youre expected to come away with the knowledge that for thousands of years this was considered the greatest war of all time you wo n't however much was spent in making this film was wasted
as a fan of homer and virgil i have to say this was one of the most disappointing movies seen in some time after the early scene of the thousand ships '' which was incredible the plot slid quickly downhill pitt did a good job with the character of achilles and others were acceptable in their roles but so much of the story had been changed that it not only made an odyssey sequel problematic but robbed the story of the wonderful reconciliation stories that followed the characters become and unbelievable from a script that took far too many liberties in attempts to improve '' a story that has stood the test of millenia sad that the could not have left well enough alone and just told the story as it was meant to be told without the improvements of individuals noticably less talented than virgil or homer it gains two stars for the stunning photography and visual effects but loses other stars for its tedious and directionless plot
a friend had just bought this dvd i happened to be visiting he wanted to show me how the special effects had been used in creating the armies i thought he was just going to show me a few minutes of film but once it went into the dvd player it just ran on and on i was literally squirming in my seat this historical '' film is so bad from brad pitt 's awkward unconvincing achilles to the painfully anachronistic acting and appearance of the whole film for some reason i kept thinking of conan the barbarian '' after about an hour i literally fled my friend 's house making some excuse i have n't been back since not for history buffs
i eagerly awaited the first season of murder she wrote '' on dvd unfortunately less than 25 minutes into the first episode the dvd froze a problem but it 's probably just dirty from shipping although no dvd from anyone except universal has this problem stop the player take out the dvd and carefully wash it with optical cloth restart the player fast forward to the skipping spot failure the dvd hangs fast forwarding ditto using the scene selection menu take the dvd out clean it again and try it in our second dvd player this time it hangs fast forwarding hangs in menu selection and hangs in the first 3 minutes after skipping several times in those 3 minutes fine one of joys of buying from amazon is that they are very good about replacing defective products except that when i request a replacement dvd amazon says that due to the number of similar problems with murder she wrote '' they will not replace the disks but instead issue a refund i have over dvds and only a few have been defective now that i think about it the defective ones have all been universal dvds i wish amazon would refuse to sell a product that they know is so defective that they wo n't even try to replace it i think universal should be ashamed for releasing a such shoddy product note there is no review of the content because i was unable to see the content
i enjoy the initial season of murder she wrote very much my wife and i are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to who dun it frequently though it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up often the audio gets out of synch with the video terrible ! we surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons but now about the way through i think we 'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided dvd's
i had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer the combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining many people love this video but i just had a bad experience with it
if you are in relatively good or even average shape and are looking to really tone up and sculpt your body this is n't the workout for you it did n't get my heart rate up and i did n't break a sweat the instructor spent too much time in between exercises to explain what was next too much down time i actually got bored the sculpting stick was not needed and the 'fanny lifer ' was used to just sit on much of the time when the exercises could have been modified standing or kneeling i am extremely disappointed i was n't sore or challenged this might be a good workout for someone who is extremely overweight and needs to go at a slower pace but anyone looking to drop lbs or firm up this is n't for you !
intensely homophobic heterosexist and hateful this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the it was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men blaming antisocial aids carriers '' for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies it was a time when the public blamed aids on irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands the film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of hiv it reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with hiv can be neatly separated into the categories of deserving '' or undeserving '' immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row twenty years ago perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic we did not know then that hiv was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about hiv and people most importantly hiv is no longer a death sentence to americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early as someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for hiv infection every year i would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment
i ordered this movie on or around july 6 2006 and have yet to receive it
there 's a 1957 film of the same name by director william asher and starring gene barry the day it 's based on the terrific john mantley speculative fiction novel this is not it nor is it a remake of any sort those looking for the original wo n't as yet find it on dvd and should not mistake this film for that one in any way this is a completely different genre and far from a classic if you want to enjoy the original story you can still find the book on and hope for a dvd release of the film
i found this dvd to be too fast moving there was not enough time to look at the screen do the action get the movement correct and understand the benefit from the exercise it was filmed in a great location but it is to condensed to really enjoy
i bought this dvd based on shiva rea 's strong reputation and some amazon reviews however i am extremely disappointed i like the concept of a customized dvd practice but it 's not really practical you spend too much time trying to watch the video while your head should be facing down or up in the poses impossible to follow along with out some verbal clues in addition you also spend too much time fiddling with the remote if you do want to customize your practice how yogic '' is that almost the antithesis of vinyasa flow ideally you should start a video and then become totally immersed in your practice as if the video is not there not stop and start and strain your neck at some point you should never even watch '' the video while doing yoga just listen and practice this is impossible with this format too bad because it is very beautiful has fabulous music and a wonderful spiritual slant in the introduction a huge disappointment for an experienced yogini and would be even more so for a beginner buy the music only or the gorgeous yoga clothes and do your own practice namaste
i too found this dvd a bit boring the instruction for each pose took forever even in the challenging workouts while explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices i did n't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence also i did not feel as if there was any flow to this dvd
i was excited about this dvd because of the customized workout feature but i could n't even make it through a preview the instructor 's voice is grating she sounds similar to denise austin so if you like me are sensitive to voice tone be warned and then there 's the unsettling parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which to my mind is entirely wrong for a yoga routine if you 're looking for a yoga dvd with a customized workout feature i 'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed yoga shakti '' by shiva rea
terrible voice depressing indoor scenery incredibly disjointed routines do n't bother with this one ! save your money
this does not engage my at all who loves the baby einstein old macdonald '' and neighborhood animals '' and used to love all bach beethovens and mozarts these dvds are the only thing that will actually keep her still when eating or when it 's time to calm down before nap and bed i was excited to introduce her to a new concept and this movie is just horrible it is very cheaply made and it keeps showing the same garden twirling star toy over and over again you would really think they would find more creative toys to put into the video so why 2 stars and not 1 i do like that the planets are named and footage of the real planets are shown as well as the stars but other than that it is just terrible and not a learning experience nor a tool for me to begin her quiet time
the title 'wake of death ' new film of van damme is rightly given to the very violent contents van damme plays a bouncer ben archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he does n't want to see for 20 years but he has a beautiful wife cynthia lisa king 'home alone 4 ' and a kid at home and all he wants is just a quiet life anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when cynthia who is an ins officer by the way takes home a little chinese girl found among the refugees from china and the little girl is connected with a chinese triad in fact a daughter of a ruthless boss sun quan simon yam 'tomb raider 2 ' and these events occur at the night when cynthia and ben are sleeping together in bed showing part of their bodies in the room typical revenge story yes van damme is getting more and more serious these days as you have seen 'in hell ' recently 'wake of death ' goes similar course but this time it 's a revenge story with more violent actions with and though the script is a standard one one inventiveness is found in the relations between van damme 's hero and his former associates french mafiosos these french gangsters give a timely help or two to van damme 's character in a more bloody fashion than the italian guys who were seen helping arnie in 'eraser ' so how good is this film it depends on your expectaions 'wake of death ' shows fairly good car stunts and but the lack of imagination on the director 's side is too obvious my opinion is it is much better than 'derailed ' his worst far below 'timecop ' arguably his best on par with 'the order ' but it 's just my idea the point is van damme shows pretty good acting here but the actions or the logics behind them look awfully disjointed the bad guy 's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained and the relations between the characters are very confusing case in point you get a glimpse of two veteran actors burt kwouk 'cato ' of 'rerurn of pink panther ' and jacqui chan 'the world of susie wong ' but the moment they appear on the screen they get killed without leaving no impression on us but most damaging thing is the film 's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall i still do not know what happened at certain point of the story philip martinez formerly producer of b action films such as 'dot kill ' or 'house of 9 ' gives his second film as director incidentally his first feature was the imdb says 'citizen verdict ' 03 starring armand assante and jerry springer ! as to 'wake of death ' he decided to shoot this film in south africa though the story is set in america fans of van damme might hail the film as his i do n't know for i still fondly remember joyful thrills when i watched his 'timecop ' or 'universal soldiers ' 'wake of death ' is good as actioner but it 's not good enough for me
very disappointing leisa hart goes much too fast for anyone to catch on to her moves the dance moves she does are much to fast to learn and so is her pace with which she teaches she does not set a very relaxing tone to her yoga poses sounds very rushed and does not teach any of her moves before she performs them it is extremely difficult to keep up with her also i thought there would be more exercises with your baby very disappointing
the dvd did n't work and returning it could n't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes
i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you 're thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate which is why i gave it 1 star instead of 0 however if you 're still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it
when i received this for christmas the year of its release i was unaware of the framing issues i had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements on top of that there were warbling sound issues with part 2 and the michael fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu this was reported on many websites also the trailers were all full screen not widescreen apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 the thing that angers me the most is that since i couldnt return part 1 to universal initially ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen i can live with it in fullscreen and i am not gon na exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with universal thanks for nothing pass this one up until its reissued with new features !
but for me at least i found it rather hard to root for mel gibson 's character given the fact that he was a major major drug dealer when the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with michelle pfeiffer and all the loot i did n't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict gibson as a loving father a phenomenally successful businessman and a one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes
i had the unfortunate experience of spending money at blockbuster and renting this dud with such big name stars i expected at least a mildly entertaining movie what i got was one hour of lifeless drab flick i could n't bear to watch another minute thus tequila sunrise '' became the first rental i stopped watching since that fateful day i rented last action hero '' the actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes lending not one iota of believability to their characters i 'm sure michelle pfeiffer mel gibson and kurt russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers i hope the actors had fun making this production i sure as heck did n't have any fun watching it
denzel washington is probably my favorite actor even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate he shone tom hanks well lem me quit hating the guy this is a movie tom did a creditable job and we had extreme with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy a passionate one though since he 's still a latino after all actually this is a hollywood message movie '' and you know what that means it 's about as subtle as michael moore those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie those who do n't agree with the message stay as far away from it as possible there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy the way they stared at him reminded me of lao wei in china '' experiences denzel 's character was reminded of segregation even though he 's too young to remember it and started to care about tom hanks ' character aids discrimination is bad actually any discrimination at all is bad and that 's the movie 's message i agree with the message but still that 's all we 've got as a totally irrelevant if the name sam francisco '' means anything to you you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination i love a great courtroom drama this one was merely good with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a film they had to take a few shortcuts here sad ai n't it but even so a film that i 'm glad i saw once not twice once is enough thank you
this was a ridiculous documentary i watched with an open mind and after it was finished i was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view it was ridiculous being that it is a michael moore movie i should have expected this but i tried to view it openly let me warn you now do n't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars
michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one ' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick this is not one of his better films
the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction he makes the best of a limited repertoire it just gets boring
this movie is superficial and populated with glamorous and unprincipled characters kate hudson while photogenic in the extreme is not believable with her fake and shaky irish accent the plot is unbelievable and the characters are offensive the structure of the film is clumsy and the idea that any sort of trusting relationship and marriage is possible with these people who can not keep it in their shorts including hudson is naive and unworldly rather than the reverse the false sense of lighthearted sophistication is tedious do n't bother
this movie is demented it 's only a tiny bit above something sold in an adult video store as it is basically just one sex scene after another if you hate other people and want to have an excuse to distrust everyone you meet watch this diseased film
paul newman plays a private eye and gene hackman and susan sarandon are a couple with a dark secret too implausible too many overdrawn secondary characters a rental at best
i am a space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley the cast was solid the director has talent and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well right nope this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense the formula kept repeating over and over something goes wrong houston advises astronauts do something all is well lather rinse repeat boring very boring i never once flet any real tension except for the initial problem '' which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end the problem is that all of the issues '' the men faced were handled so rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked it was just yeah attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened maybe a few times but only for a minute or two some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting how so i must ask nothing really happened it was not emotional at all since the struggles '' of the men were so poorly portrayed to each his own i guess but 4 stars geeez just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks ! the family interactions were pretty standard crying wife kids asking questions annoying media attention etc etc yeah i could feel for the characters to some extent but again this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and special effects too bad i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored not recommended
do n't bother wasting your time with this movie instead read the book the book was one of the best i have ever read the movie left me wanting i rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through so maybe i am being unfair since i did not watch the whole movie but honestly i could n't it just did n't do the story justice
noam has been around for quite some time and has a wide audience of follwers chomsky is highly critical of us foreign policy he attacks both the right and the left the world is very complicate due to human nature not noam chomsky 's analysis he has many adherents especially from well known universities including berekley but chomsky is marking his arguments in the form of speeches books dvds yes the truth must come out he is making money of it ! people need to be more not less informed and they do n't necessarily and should not be totally absorbed by chomsky 's politics i find chomsky 's following from two conflicting levels humorous in nature and tunnel vision in nature humorous because people do n't think for themselves tunnel vision because people do n't think for themselves we humans have been in conflict from day one we do n't need chomsky to remind us of this being an independent thinker is so important and critically rewarding yet many scholars '' make the same mistake they look to others for validation they almost can not think for themselves america is a great nation we should honor all that is good question what is not and support and strengthen this great nation
the only good thing in this movie was howard 's performance she is innocent and believable i ca n't understand how good actors like weaver hurt and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this the 'plain ' dialogue among the 'elders ' is painfully numbing choppy and stilted and the directing drove me crazy especially since night insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through or following them without ever bothering with these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera if you like the back of william hurt 's head you 'll get plenty of it in this film the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague which is too bad since when he finally has a good speech we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes i agree with others i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode rent it first before you buy and save some money for a classic thriller like psycho
this movie is the most boring uninteresting piece of garbage i have ever wasted my money on the plot is stupid the characters are dull and insipid and the whole movie leaves you asking as the credits run so what '' do n't waste your money !
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
i knew the ending within the first 10 minutes night shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at denny's
i 'm a wilbur smith fan so i bought this dvd thinking it would be interesting silly me are movies ever comparable to the books despite the excellent cast the acting was third rate and the movie came across as sort of danielle steelish not wilbur smith given the talent involved in the film the film makers could have done much better
the only good thing in this movie is jolene blalock as a femme fetale the problem with this film to paraphrase an old quote is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it truly only wilbur smoth knows how to pull off south african grand guignol and have you care unfortunately wilbur smith has nothing to do with this and it shows
bought dvd mainly cos am a alyssa milano fan but to be honest she was completely wasted in this film quite a good story but seemed to have a really rushed ending probably an ok television movie to watch on a rainy day and worth getting just to have a laugh at the acting from the guy who plays benedict if your an alyssa fan stick with charmed
i myself am a huge fan i had read the reviews here and i thought it was worth a shot seeing it well the script was terrible the story even worse direction do n't get me started one reviewer said it it was like they did n't know whose point of view to choose the soundtrack was awful the ending was sooo stupid did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them they just keep standing there like nothing is happening i really have n't seen a movie this bad in well ever ! ! oh and alyson hannigan 's acting was way better in my stepmother is an alien i think she was about 13 in that role do n't get me wrong she 's a extremely talented actress i blame it on the script rent it do n't buy it you 'll be embarassed to own it i am
if you are willing to risk to watch this movie just a warning it 's really a turkey one of the big
never could have guesse that this movie would be so bad could not reach the end of it a very rare occasion ! ! the dialogues are so ludicrous characters and acting obnoxious i ca n't i repeat i ca n't understand how alyson hannigan starred this piece of shame on me for being such a buffy fan and having the bad habit of renting buying anything remotely related to the cast of buffy
if you wan na watch kinsi and alyson hannigan embarrassing themselves by accepting to work in such a mean bad and mediocre movie than this is the right movie the history is a joke direction is floppy almost non existant alyson hanningan gives her worst performance ever it 's one of those movies that i 'm sure everybody involved after watchin the final footage excclaimed what have we done '' ! ! awfu
there 's a lot of things wrong with this movie being the wasted talents of its gifted cast nastassja kinski cat people one night stand alyson hannigan boys and girls tv 's buffy the vampire slayer jennifer esposito tv 's spin city master of disguise brian mccradie speed 2 cruise control steve harris tv 's the practice minority report todd field stranger than fiction twister and even the always awesome alexis denisof tv 's angel rouge trader are all burned out with a soggy script and its way too familiar and formulaic it 's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end i really thought the accents of both mccradie and denisof trying to do russians was bad mccradie is irish isnt he and denisof is like i 'm not buying it for one second kinski hannigan and esposito are all sexy but like i said much fun drags on a long time
the only reason i bought this movie is because alison hannigan and alexis denisof was in it i 'm a huge buffy fan i knew it was n't going to be the greatest films ever made but i did n't realize how bad it was going to be watching the film i felt almost embarassed for the actors since they were given such crappy material the story line was thin and it seemed like the movie could n't decide from whose point of view it wanted to tell the story from it begins and ends with a narration of the of jennifer episito 's character but for most of the film he is n't an important character the direction was horrible it seemed they tried to make shots that were supposed to look cool but it only looked like they were covering up there low budget of a film there were some scenes that made me feel like i was watching an episode of dawson creek or smallville because there were quite a few scenes with songs playing while showing how sad or troubled a character was i really wish they had cut that out because it had no point and made the movie drag out even longer than it should have the only good thing about the movie was the acting especially from the three female leads i actually thought hannigan and kinski had chemistry together i would only recomend this movie to die hard buffy fans or if you 're a die hard fan of another actor in this film and then you should only rent it
rip it off '' is not an easy film to watch in short it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line leaving only the most attentive viewer read myself to guess at what was going to happen next but not in a good way judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such and talented personalities as alyson hannigan and jennifer esposito it begs the question why did you do this film or on a personal note why did i buy this film especially at 22 and change frankly i bought it because of alyson hannigan she 's gorgeous obviously intelligent and the girl can act individually speaking she does not disappoint here it 's obvious that she really did n't want to sleep walk through her role as lexi and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes she is a singularly interesting actor to watch and her performance simply wants me to see her do more preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film see jennifer aniston in her brave performance in the good girl but enough gushing if hannigan had not been as engaged i would have trashed her soundly most everyone else in rip it off '' with the possible exception of the fellow who plays sergei with operatic relish is more or less phoning it in '' when they do their scenes this made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy also films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort beware ! do not adjust your screen the appearance of the film is inherently bad rip it off '' and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye i 've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey and contrary to the technical description of the dvd it is presented in the horror that is full screen and not widescreen can you believe people invest money in these films ahem
greatest film ever made '' it may be true the restoration was lovingly done however for whatever reason the subtitles are in white on a black and white film when the background is black you as viewer are in luck but when the background id white sufice it to say that unless you speak french you are going to have a very frustrating time watching this criterion edition of the film a word of warning
my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor it 's all style no substance i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks long slow camara pans across stephen dorff 's very trendy and stylish haircut and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with despite the very feel of it the story is lost the viewer is never quite sure if the philosophy '' of the main character is meant to be taken seriously and the style is nothing we have n't seen done better other places all in all i found it pretty vapid painfully slow and incredibly frustrating because there is a good movie in here somewhere if only the script had gone to someone else to make on a side note toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went
i really thought this was pretty lame movie and in no way a comparrison to reservoir dogs or pulp fiction the way one reviewer described the attempt is to tell a story about some kid played by stephen dorff who becomes a icon because he was held hostage and apparently did n't care at least thats what i got out of it i think what turned me off the most about this movie was dorff 's character an '' rebel type who 's mean to his apparently oppresive father and of a mother slam dances and tears up his room i guess to prove to us how cool he is and who can get in front of an audience of high school kids and proudly cuss for no other reason then he 'll know it 'll get laughs in real life someone like that would be considered a slacker or an but for the case of this movie i guess he 's cool anyway my problems with the character aside this movie just was n't that good to begin with a really weak script and i swear each of these leading actors could have and have done about ten times better since so i wonder why the only put in half the effort for this one maybe they knew it was n't going anywhere and needed the paycheck as cool and revolutionary it tries to be does n't really do anything all that spectacular the gun battle at the end with the terrorists as well as the movie 's protrayal of the media are the best and really only good things about this movie but most of you kiddies out there will probably like it because it has people cussing and drinking beer but that 's just my opinion i could be wrong
not a whole heck of a lot happens in the 90 minute film in which a woman wanders through the streets of paris as she anxiously awaits a medical appointment at which she will receive the results of a test she buys a hat meets up with a friend talks a walk in the park etc the events all unfold in real time and the early 60 's mostly black and white cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous but on the whole this one comes across a little too self consciously arty for its own good nice at times but hardly profound perhaps this was more compelling back in 1962 2 stars
i seem to have only gotten the cliff notes on my dvd and not the story innocent eugenie is take to an island by a rich couple who do business with her father he knows they are interested in exploiting her for sexual purposes but they promise nothing too strong well they constantly drug eugenie through her drinks and the wife starts the journey into perversion '' by having them bath and wash together there are a few steps but very few indeed and soon eugenie is happily involved in satanic rituals and removing body parts from participants what kind of story is this eugenie does n't take much to be corrupted we do n't see much conflict or the psychology of any transformation it all just happens i do n't see any convincing story of a seduction into this huge personality change at all i really do n't know what people see in this film and how it gets such great reviews i guess when the erotic '' scenes are red and blurred this causes people to feel it is sophisticated camera work and film style and are impressed by it instead of being a journey into perversion innocent eugenie jumps right into satanic rituals with no explanation i do n't see anything compelling about this at all
i thought the movie was alright but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
some talented dvd editor should take the latest 3 movies and cut out the dumb scenes about 75 of each movie and put them all together to make one decent movie
i think the only strong points of the phantom menace '' is darth maul and the lightsaber duals which i thought were well done and the visual effects and scenery but other than that the phantom menace '' was just an unfortunate mistake i think the problem is that lucas broke one of the unofficial science fiction filmmaking rules or at least show them as little as possible how can we take a space dogfight scene seriously when you have a little kid who does n't know how to pilot a fighter buzzing all around the battle and saying things like this is intense '' i never understood why they felt they had to go that far back into anakin 's life anyway why not just begin the story with anakin in his twenties and already under the tutelage of that 's when all the important events began and jar jar well we know the consensus on him well at least things got more serious again in attack of the clones '' and would continue to improve with revenge of the sith
what the hell happened to lucas how could he go from a wordy but brilliant to a creator of this dross in recent years i 've decided that i 've been too harsh on my initial views of phantom '' i guess seeing where he was finally going in sith '' made me appreciate the little things in here more however this reassessment has not made me decide this film was in any shape good '' or measured up to star wars '' where to begin well let 's start with the bad lucas has obviously fallen in love with what can be done with cgi the special effects in here like the trial balloon effects he did in the reedited first trilogy are breathtaking he seemed to forget however that vistas and lifelike illusions are no replacement for characters we care about and plot that actually make sense a lot of people blame poor jake lloyd for being a bad anakin but he was all of 8 when phantom '' was made it was also his first major movie a good director can make a zucchini passable and a child actor good lucas dropped the ball with him though and without proper mentoring he probably felt like a dorothy dropped in an oz not of his own making oh yes let 's not leave out the dialogue lucas has been known for his wordy '' characters but here we go over the top with whole technobabble soliloqueys about midichlorians '' and the sith having their revenge '' with no subtext no connection with any past that an extended universe '' virgin would undertand and the hints of racism that permeate the whole production the chinee waiter '' trade fed leader neomoideans were only a start hint at darker things to come such as jar jar binks ah jar jar binks the ugly entire books have been written trying to surmise just what the hell lucas was thinking when he put this lovechild so prominently in an important chapter of his story i have to admit that the cgi on him was he really seemed to be with the human characters yet he really was a horrorshow as he mirrored all those happy bouncing house negro '' characters so prominent in film one has to wonder what photos of ahmad best lucas has in his office safe to make him go along and defend in interview after interview with bringing binks to shuffling mesa boyos '' life and i was unfair to bill cosby 's beloved character by comparing him with binks but really doesn anyone even know what the heck he 's saying even lucas probably is n't sure after all that crapping on phantom '' sorry if it was a bit much but when i saw it in the cinema i had such high hopes for it and they were bitterly shot down in flames so it 's hard to be kind you 'll probably wonder just what i see good '' in it well actually quite a lot not whole film '' quantities but enough to keep me from attempting to leave a zero '' as my rating i ca n't deny the beauty of lucas 's worlds even the desolate tattoine and he really knows how to create action sequences the lightsabre duels and podrace sequence did recapture some of my childhood wow '' the occasional bit of slapstick does bring a giggle to me when they 're not overused too many gags but what saves the film is the cast and what a cast it is ewan macgregor as a youthful liam neeson as the and the beautiful natalie portman as padme ' brilliant and able to make us care about our folks despite not because of lucas 's hackwork so the is it essential i 'd have to say yes we get to see the development of a sarcastic apprentice and know he was n't always we get to see bucking the jedi system and showing a depth of compassion for his charges we 'd need another of film time anywhere else and with anyone else other than neeson and we get to see the last painful moments of innocence from anakin skywalker please again give young jake a break i thought he did well with what he had before the coming fall
the summer of 1999 aged 15 was the day i felt my innocence shattered i had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a star wars i could call my own as in made in my generation only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of lifeless acting a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough cgi to make your eyes bleed the actors including heavy weights like liam neeson and samuel jackson up and comers natalie portman and gradually progressing into leading man status ewan mcgregor are all wasted here neeson mcgregor and jackson are ok but ok is all they are but they do n't stand out at all nor does portman all i can say of jake lloyd is that he looks like he 's having fun then there 's jar jar binks argh what was lucas thinking and poor darth maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him but what 's most offensive of all aside from the acting are the continuity errors all these years we were led to believe that mcgregor risked a lot to make anakin a jedi knight but here 's little more than a banana lurking in the background while jinn neeson is at the front line doing what he can to get anakin ahead and it 's just wrong that was what hurt me the most the fact that the film was n't about that it did n't adhere to previous star wars history and episode 2 alas is n't that big of an improvement
i copied and pasted the bottom of this from another reviewer here i have not seen this dvd but thanks to this person for not wasting my money for some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do not get it ! we fans do not want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd ! ! who pray tell when they are at a concert in person spends a bunch of time looking around the fans and not the show get it yet doh ! simple ! keep the cameras on the show ! and dont change from one camera to another every 5 seconds ! that pisses me off too to no end learn this watch roger waters dvd in the flesh learn learn learn ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although ned o'hanlon said in an interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the boston show the spirit of the entire show is captured very well shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm
i feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here i thought i was too uncoordinated to get this down but the left to right on this dvd is really confusing once i get messed up there 's no getting it back i do not recommend this for anyone who is just starting out it 's not easy to pick up the flow he goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it to telling you to mix them all together by name i 'm sorry but when i am learning a movement i ca n't remember what to do after only being told once i am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than i am to the names of them ! i 'm just left frustrated and wondering which dvd i should start with instead
i totally agree with red hatter intructor says one thing while he 's doing another its confusingadn im not even sure which way is the right way
i had my doubts about this film when it came out and now that i 've finally seen it i know why it 's manipulative and unrealistic penn does a decent job playing sam the mentally handicapped pfeiffer 's not bad as his lawyer but neither can save the script from its pitfalls namely an unrealistic portrayal of a grown man with the mind of a seven year old none of the characters come of seeming like real people so much as types even his daughter the annoying fanning is more hollywood precociousness about her than childlike qualities more time seems to have been spent on product placement that developing the story and characters the saving grace is the slight ambiguity of the ending i thought for sure they 'd settle for the cheap easy ending just as they settled for the cheap and easy everywhere else in the film
jonathan safran foer 's book is a truly literary work and this movie is not a book and as many have already said in amazon 's ratings this movie is not like foer 's book it is unfailingly cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria thus although i will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie the cinematographer captures an oddity serenity and disturbance i can not agree with those who give it high marks the plot is sparse as is much of the character development i am especially disappointed with the portrayal of alex and his grandfather i found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or alex in the movie 's final dramatic scenes the grandfather 's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does alex 's reaction to his grandfather 's action morevover the parallels between the jsf character and the ukranian characters seem forced the only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative 's backstory overall i felt untouched by this movie and one last note why is it even called everything is illuminated '' that title illuminates little within the movie
this movie was a bit lame for me robin williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie and the supporting cast was n't much better but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen even if this had been a good movie the green screen was very distracting i would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff
when i sit down in the theater to watch a film i start with a neutral rating of zero so that the movie itself can then take me up the star rating or down i rate differently than most i do it for my purposes in a much better way trust me you should try it start out neutral then be mutable go up or down with your rating as the movie progresses at the end of the day you will come up with what is a personally more accurate composite rather than a final less derived method of judgment if only waiting until the end to state your case much of your case can not be stated you will come up with a more accurate impression if the film is evaluated as you go very important also is the type of rating never limit yourself to the typical star confinement always allow yourself a much more realistic range of from a minus ten stars up to a plus ten stars or at the very least a negative five up ten to a plus five stars you will like it better personally you know very well you have seen a movie where zero stars is simply not low enough this movie i generally have a difficult time recovering up into the level on my movie score card rating back into the positive rating category when i consider the overall rating ultimately given when in the first few minutes i am abused by a movie in the way this one burnt it is not a good sign or indicator of good quality to come when a deranged icky creep in his underwear comes out of the bathroom in someone else 's house screeches shoots the lead actor in the gut then commits suicide after blithering back into the bathroom it was n't scary it was n't a harbinger of great things to come it was just crude offensive and a cheap way to get intellectually challenged viewers to want more right off the bat this is a gross totally classless way to abuse a captive audience paying for hopefully a well thought out storyline artfully delivered the art of movie making was sacrificed in favor of a blood and guts in your face introduction sitting with my wife i told her within five minutes of the opening curtain that willis was one of them '' she waited until near the end and asked me how i knew that so soon well my first clue '' i says was when he willis was shot dead on his own bed by the with the concave chest during the offensive first scene just before he splattered his own blood and brains all over the bathroom as far out into the bedroom as possible '' think about it from that opening scene on willis did not interact with anyone the way normal people interact even if one stretches reality in order to conceive the acceptance subsequent interactions were not right and very obviously so now do n't misunderstand i have seen many films that are filled with all kinds of gritty gore and head squashing this particular film was so low class in its attempt to shock the viewers that it was simply disgusting believe it or not the classless opening is not the main reason upon which i rate this movie a minus nine stars the reason is this the single most predominant cause of my disliking this film is philosophical in nature that is i do not like any message that implies that we ourselves are not responsible for what affects our lives everyone would love to get off easy for their own actions that have led to poor conditions within which they themselves find yielding the responsibility for our behavior and course of our lives blaming our own individual predicaments on other forces by us uncontrollable and subject to another force or entity is the biggest excuse for self produced bad circumstances that mankind has ever used the most often used that is uneducated people those that have n't been around have n't traveled are not do not see or hear or care to understand the world and their place in it hoping to blame something else for their resultant condition they eat this up it is too frightening for them to face their action 's consequences so just love to excuse themselves from their own equation catalyzed by this type of tripe the completely erroneous idea that what will be will be or what will happen happens is rooted in certain eastern philosophies '' based on the idea that man is inconsequential in his own environment and might just as well not try to improve his own conditions since what is gong to be will be no matter what the western philosophy of life '' where what happens to us depends a great deal upon how hard we work at being and becoming what we want to be is the main reason those cultures seeing the world and life and our place in it in that way that are light years ahead of societies which have been around for thousands of years longer if water is not delivered by pipes directly into our homes then it was not meant to be and why fight what is meant to be if sewage is not drained from our homes by pipes to be deposited in recycling plants then it is useless for us to change what is into what might be better since it is the way it is since what is is what results of this approach if these views of life are taken as unalterable facts is that no motivation exists to stop from lazily sitting and watching life go by being what it will be this film sends a message that other forces make puppets out of us so our screw ups are not our blame that 's a bad way to approach life bad even if the premise of this film is accepted the positive reasons for the sixth sense to exist at all were left on the cutting room floor the examples of the workings of the mechanism that might even slightly imply why things were ok to be the way the film portrayed were left out go figure one could lie to himself with that assumption albeit erroneous if why what was the main theme of the movie had been even somewhat justified
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak '' with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out
i was so disappointed with this video i thought it would contain more than it did but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all i had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did but it fell far short this only contains two very basic sequences surya namaskara a b it does n't even go into the full series and i do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about there is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all ! the two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses but this video just stops abruptly at that point i found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout as soon as i did it i felt that i had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home i ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further
although a lot of people said it is good this dvd may not attract other people what i am looking for is a beautiful song but the title and the cover of this dvd is much more beautiful than the concert i think i bought the wrong dvd i could n't conclude the music is not good it is just not my style it may be amazing for many incubus fans to me i just feel the dvd is very noisy when you place the order please check on the web about the incubus and make sure you understand you are going to buy enjoy it
let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic regardless of the fact that it did n't stick with a few key plotlines in the book everyone still did a great job adapting the original jurassic park then came this piece of trash whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book this one just takes the brilliant writing of michael chrichton and throws it directly out the window first off john hammond is supposed to be dead he dies at the end of the first novel secondly ian malcome is supposedly dead or at least mia at the end of the first book and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the there is no bratty daughter and the entire premise has much more to it most importantly the entire ending in san diego with the which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies did not exist in the book ! i went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist and the anticipation of some good to top it off what i ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page not only that but because of the lack of plot the dino scenes are complete when you see so much of it you lose that awe and wonder of the first film when you see that brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film the wonderment is difficult to rival there are no such moments in this film if you 're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino fx go nuts however if you 're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline flick off the dvd player and pick up the book oh and one more thing do n't go near the movie they did n't even have a book to be untrue to i ca n't imagine how much more and rambling my review would be for that one
i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore yuck ! and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters stay goldblum the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better
i 've had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week it was on tv here otherwise i do n't think i would have watched it my instincts would have been correct an action technothriller stealth has a predictable plot a new elite team of 3 pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots including a disrespect for authority mayhem ensues people die the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence and they work together to save the female pilot who 's gone down in north korea the plot direction and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads josh lucas jessica biel jamie foxx that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart i 'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads and came away disappointed me i was expecting little so i guess my expectations were met though i will say i was amused by the last line
this movie had some good potental in the opening after that it looses all grip on everything the plot of the movie is based on a new jsf style creation fighter and a new vto l controlled artificially by a ai '' one thing leads to another the ai '' goes haywire during a lighting storm it starts acting on it 's own to destroy threats '' one thing leads to another their in tajikistan setting off dirty nuclear weapons north korea russia for absoulutly no reason breaking numerus international laws at one point in the movie the star of the movie falon 1 '' helps destroy intercepting fighters with the ai '' whois hes ment to track down breaking a bunch of laws himself and is treated like a hero at the end it 's a backwards movie do n't watch it please don't
if you have bothered to read all the other reviews here i think you will get the point but still unsure think of knightrider from the sure edi used the same voice ! ! then add some thunderbird puppets thats a bit mean at least they had personality then add a dash of on a budget oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old ! a bit scathing you may feel but deservedly so afraid seriously watch some paint dry for a couple of hours at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz
they call it brainless fun but it 's not even fun yes stealth '' is that bad movie that 's actually so bad it 's no fun it starts out bad from the beginning with an title sequence dating this film in the near future '' which should trip alarms for anybody whose ever watched an episode of mystery science theater 3000 '' the heroes of our story three pilots assigned to fly us fighters called talons '' are reluctantly joined by a fourth pilot a robotic fighter jet called edi trouble starts immediately when edi develops an acute case of and faster than you can say i 'm sorry dave i really ca n't do that '' edi is ignoring orders and raising all sorts of havoc it 's hard to get more specific without ruining the plot because there really is n't any plot the story we see on the screen hints at several different that never form into a single story we have the plot about stopping crazy edi '' the plot about the evil admiral played by sam shepard who will do anything he can to keep the lid on edi when he goes bad we have jessica biel as a fighter pilot running from the bad guys after she 's shutdown over north korea then we have josh lucas as the other talon pilot whose on the run from some goons who are trying to oh who cares none of these plots go anywhere but what about them effex stealth '' offers us hours of aerial dogfighting in unsurpassed cgi unsurpassed because the movie demonstrates that there are some things that simply ca n't be left to computer animation even though they 're next generation aircraft the talon fighters never convincingly look like any airplanes and the aerial effects here look little more believable than those done over 20 years ago in firefox '' or deal of the century '' or nowadays on any flight simulator game run on any the effects compound the error by maximizing use of impossible shots '' shots that could n't be seen by a human perspective such as those that cut across the sky and directly inside the subject aircraft it 's a clever shot but not a terrible smart one they never stop reminding us that these are effects it 's probably too much effort to explain that even elite fighter pilots do n't want to be confused by a flight panel that suddenly starts broadcasting images of a bunch of terrorists sitting down as if for a cnn or that none of the pilots come off as even casual aviators stealth '' is one of those mindless movies that effete snobbish reviewers like to blame on teenage boys but this flick lost a ton of money stealthy profits which is only strong proof that the monster audience of mindless boys is itself a delusion of these frustrated critics and studio execs or even stronger proof that those mindless teenage boys may be smarter than anybody realizes
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens very disapointtin
q the winged serpent was one of the worst movies i have even seen i went into the film knowing it was a b movie '' but still wanting to be entertained i was not entertained for a 1982 film the gore in q the winged serpent probably shocked quite a few people there is also a scene that is quite enticing but aside from these two points of note the film offered little else including entertainment the acting was passable but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out the ok acting goes to waste save your money this is one of the worst movies ever made there are far better b movies it is the type of movie i would have liked in college in 1987 if i had been drunk and looking for laughs but this is 2006 and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity you wo n't like q the winged serpent at all even for the drunk college student there are far better ways to spend 90 minutes stay away total score out of 100 7 2 out of 50 enjoyment a rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film 4 out of 10 acting how good was the acting 1 out of 10 immersion did the movie suck me into the story 0 out of 10 intangibles special effects movie pace is the movie forgettable or something you will talk about and remember for weeks years 0 out of 10 must see is this movie worth 0 out of 10 must buy is this movie a must
q larry cohen 1982 i have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes unfortunately to say q has n't aged well is being quite kind quetzalcoatl the title character is a very large who 's flying around new york eating people who find themselves in high places at least he might be quetzalcoatl an aztec god or he might just be a big mutant no one knows more to the point no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off new yorkers the cops assigned to the case shepard david carradine and powell richard roundtree certainly take things in stride the commissioner malachy mccourt frank 's brother is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events disbelief while the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story its actual core is jimmy quinn a young michael moriarty a crook who 's run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own jimmy 's odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller and there are glimmers of that sort of thing but the script never follows through q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface the special effects are alarmingly and hysterically and the characters were they to stand still could often substitute for props but hey it 's got a big flying lizard that 's something
this is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 new york there are generous aerial views lots of location shooting etc than as a horror movie even a cheesy one the special effects are used extremely sparingly with the word special '' being a definite overstatement some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings but not by much in the end q the winged serpent '' is watchable and certainly not horribly bad but it 's hard to imagine this being anybody 's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure to end on a positive note the dvd features a clean sharp print of the film
whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around few of them seem to have jobs and party all day the main character sid is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism the film appeals to naive youth
of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me poor acting and hard to understand dialoge would get a refund if you were in australia but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas and it could get lost in the mail debr
when the background music completely overpowers the dialogue you may as well turn it off the background music was piercing and i needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm a shame because otherwise i could have enjoyed crash
this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times the owens girls are hereditary witches any man who loves one is doomed to an early death there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion this requires the sacrifice of a dove two little girls watch years later they 're grown up one leaves to live with her boyfriend but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck never stand in the middle of a road we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell witch '' as if to symbolize something sally goes when jillian calls her she has a problem with her boyfriend but sally uses a magic potion '' to eliminate the problem now jillian wants to undo what was done the film began to lose me now it was n't funny the spell goes awry they bury their mistake then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles later an investigator comes around looking for jimmy the story drags again more scenes follow they are not funny or scary or even entertaining but a scene in the attic will wake you even if you 're snoozing ! they call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of jillian it seems to work even if they do n't use the standard issue witches broom there is a sort of happy ending sandra and nicole are good actresses but they ca n't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies i 've ever seen bell book and candle '' is a funnier film blair witch '' is a scarier film this falls between the cracks
awesome movies but way too expensive for the product itself first i bought it at a reduced priced since it was left sitting on a shelve collecting dust for a few years in the store they dropped the price from a initial 200 can around 150 to 149 can around 110 and that was the cheapest price i could find it in my city and by far a few of the stores told me that their cost was around 149 can so it was able to buy it at around cost considering that it was a bargain so i got lucky to start with now the movies they are awesome and after watching them all in two days i felt sad sad at hollywood and the current level of movie making after tasting a piece of history with movies that are deep funny either deals with issues seven samurai and hidden fortress or do n't yojimbo and sanjuro they are all movie gems but we can also be realistic here seven samurai in my opinion is the real champion in this set it has everything it 's epic yet personal it 's deep yet sometime funny but always powerful and superb now to the quality of the disk that where it 's hard to tell these are old movies but something struck me as odd seven samurai was done around 10 yrs before yojimbo and sanjuro but looks and sound better obviously they cleaned it out a little before putting it to dvd but then if yojimbo and sanjuro where made 10 yrs later someone should expect at least a equal quality if not better then the but it 's not the case especially yojimbo is painful to watch the sound track has a loud background hiss for at least half of the movie scratches as big as a straw that last a full min multiple times the contrast and brightness is out of wack in half the scenes it 's a painful experience you tell yourself how great the movie is but is it ever ugly to watch so far i would give it 4 stars why then i give it 2 it 's down to price vs quality and extras no extras what so ever beside the theater trailer of each movie and a commentary track for then nothing so criterion in my mind had two choice drop the price to to of what it is now or pick a better original copy to bring on dvd clean it and add extras selling it to the same price it is now but they did neither they used for yojimbo a terribly copy add nothing and charge full criterion price bad ! ! ! so in the end one fell like being robbed by ronins in my case i wanted to see those movies and own and this box set was the only way to go about doing this and in the end i praise the movie the acting the story the camera work everything except criterion dvd who brought those movies it north america they dropped the ball on this one so 0 stars for criterion and there dvd product in this case and 4 stars for the movie themselves so my end review is 2 stars
after 40 minutes of objective viewing and shot after superfluous shot i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from kong is not an epic it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing if you will but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this jackson no more 'epic shots please
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ! peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
the depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned from the moment they reached king kong 's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience i felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape how can anyone feel anything for king kong he keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island forces them to provide him sacrificial women and tortures the female star of the movie it seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking king kong the villains of the movie were my heroes i kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end
after i read erik larson 's wonderful book the devil in the white city '' i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes ' story but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment the production is amateurish at best complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of mondo carne '' with such a wealth of fascinating information available court transcripts etc do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland truly disappointing perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes this most certainly is n't it
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of
i would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible i would say it is immature obvious and overwhelmingly it seems spike lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid racist phony or downright evil i had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words lee had his moments but it was pretty much a music video spike lee does n't mess with fantasy only with reality and his reality is black and white it is infact fantasy and pure propaganda
i have to admit that i did n't like this movie very much it shows tom cruise 's domestic circumstances but this subplot does n't seem to be woven well with the rest of the movie
sorry after minority report which actually looked great compared to this performance of cruise i did n't think it could get worse yeah it did i did n't rank a one because it was a classic story and the action was ok at times but crazy cruise was just a stinker in it i just did n't care for his performance i ca n't help expecting every time tom cruise opens his mouth to expect to hear show me the money '' i was hoping spielberg would have cast an unknown in this spot or someone that could look a bit more grubby more manly cruise still looks like a kid definitely not the original radio brodcast tim robins did a fair job i would have liked to see him in the main character roll than cruise catch this one on tv hbo or something or rent it if you must just not my collection type movie though i know my review is taking a beating but i just did n't care for this movie
nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi
well that 's part of my life i 'll never get back ! i ca n't figure out why this movie got such great reviews i was totally bored by it do n't waste your time there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk
one of the types of film i hate the most are precious conceits by film people about themselves at work this is far less about the story in ts than it is a twee take on how clever they were trying to film it skip this buy the book and read it of course and get a sense of where thomas pynchon might have first conceived his style essentially this is a brit take on the same ideas visited by truffaut in day for night '' the core movie is different but it 's the same story and while from a certain perspective you might say it 's in the spirit of ts in point of fact ts could have been any book about which they were making an underfunded film quel surprise ! the best of the movie for me was the brief dialogue anderson engages in with rob brody and the blackened screen my 2 stars coogan looks like he wants to get out of this film as quickly as possible most of the others are n't sure if they are in the film or in the accompanying making of '' disc and for the record i never bothered with the other disc what for
yup it 's that dc hating teen on her dad 's account although gg is possibly one my favorite television series i was disappointed with this one possibly no character development except maybe lorelai jared padalecki 's annoyingly routine guest spots as chump cheater dean forrester gets on my last nerve i could smack rory for sleeping with him and ruining his fated marriage meanwhile lorelai becomes almost ditzy her relationship with jason stiles gets quite boring she 's totally oblivious to luke 's obvious infatuation with her emily and richard 's seperation is the best part watching them bicker is funny the end kiss with is the best part otherwise do n't get it
what can you say about dead breakfast '' i picked this up at the store not knowing much about it other than it had a cute title clever holographic packaging a few decent reviews and a young appealing cast i can say that the charms unfortunately of the actual film are relatively limited pretty standard fare really i did n't necessarily dislike it i just felt that it was so obvious in its intention this film wants to be cool it was designed to hopefully be a cult classic it wants you to revel in its kookiness but that 's just the problem taking its cues from so many better movies this is a and unoriginal mess the cast and filmmakers seem to be having a good time you know this was a party set it seems as if they feel that they are doing us a great service by letting us in on the joke well i 've heard the joke so do n't do me any favors i 'm not saying that there are n't some amusing moments how can you fail with redneck zombies and musical numbers are always fun and the cast will be familiar to many even if you ca n't always place from where the movie imagines that it 's evil dead 2 '' but it lacks real cleverness it works slightly better as a comedy than anything else but it 's hard for me to imagine anyone being captivated by this
unfortunately the dvd i received was a region 1 dvd and could not be played i denmark which i informed you about and after som exchanges of mail you very kindly arranged a refund to my account of the purchase price and i have bought the same dvd from another source although i probably could have bought a usable dvd from amazon in the uk but this information was never relayed to me i only have to live with the cost of importing the dvd into denmark about the purchase value of the dvd but every experience costs money normally so thank you for your service in this matter best regards peter daugbjer
i found this film simply irritating i ca n't think why it should be required viewing '' like some reviewers claim maybe for those who are into teaching who absolutely love kids and for those who do rural sociology i must be forgetting some other trade but for most of us it only shows how difficult it must be to teach very young kids and how vital that role is as kim anehall puts so well in amazon to be and to have offers some true insights on the job as teachers should be regarded as everyday heroes in the last line of defense in a developing society '' i think that the director philibert never scrapes below the surface '' of the teaching process itself leaving us instead with plain empiria and the lessons '' seems staked like if lopez would like to prove how good he is at teaching and as a person but as a reviewer notes the camera shows very clearly when the kids have learnt their lesson and when they do n't which is most of the times the stark contrast of the conditons of life '' in france compared to any underdeveloped country is painful the teacher drives a big audi ! the schools themselves are nice and lofty and they all have all the necessary equipment the kind of things people take for granted on the developed world i 'd love to have this system back in my country argentina specifically in the conurbano bonaerense '' where teachers are n't paid for months pupils go to school basically to have a meal their parents ca n't afford back home and violence is the rule of the game i laughed with one american reviewer when he said that probaby jojo would be medicated in the us if you want to know about different methods of education you could always watch for instance kiarostami 's where is the friend 's home '' to learn how the other half of the world lives the cinematography is very nice i agree with another amazon reviewer matt curtin columbus oh usa on the lopez'saga of suits that he would later claim that he was due some additional compensation that was never part of the deal reminds me of his interaction with young jojo even our greatest teachers are still ultimately human complete with their own weaknesses perhaps the final lesson is that even disappointment is a part of life '' same goes for the great manohla dargis on the la times apparently the french are not so very different after all ''
there are two main female characters in the plot one is a who will sleep her way to the top although she may not even need it because she is good independently and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband 's this is a man 's fantasy and nightmare come true in one and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world to all the hollywood men out there you ca n't brainwash us anymore with your okay
this is my number one most overrated movie of all time we saw it at a pretensious artsy theater along with an assortment of and wooly haired intellectuals they all cheered of course when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water then becomes the chief the truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable given the politically correct theme the truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture the truth is that tradition is not inherently evil the truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys basically if you hate men this is the flick for you but it is not good it is not creative there are no surprises there is just nothing there as i edit this it 's no surprise to find so few people liked this review there are still plenty of hippies and politically correct 's out there
anyone who is doing any kind of serious research into dan brown 's da vinci code should be aware of some important information that is n't revealed in 'jesus mary and da vinci ' brown 's book which he claims in the preface is based on 'fact ' is actually perpetuating a known and established fraud with respect to its claims regarding the 'priory of sion ' and the 'dossier secret ' documents in the french national libary it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the 'priory of sion ' and the 'dossier secret ' documents are in fact the fraudulent creation of a circle of french nationalists who revolve around the figure of pierre plantard plantard was a primary source for the authors of 'holy blood holy grail ' which dan brown attributes as one of his primary sources for the 'da vinci code ' this information has been brought to light in the excellent video 'breaking the da vinci code ' as well as by cbs 's 60 minutes which filmed their own investigation into brown 's claims on a show that recently aired on april basically brown propagates the same fraudulent information that he inherits from his uncritical use of 'holy blood holy grail ' not very good form for someone who claims his fictional novel is based on 'fact ' there are numerous other errors misrepresentation and outright fabrications in brown 's book that are n't adequately addressed in 'jesus mary and da vinci ' those who are truly interested in some solid scholarly research on brown 's book would be well served by viewing the excellent video 'breaking da vinci 's code ' also available on there 's nothing wrong with reading and understanding the 'da vinci code ' as a work of fiction which it is but do n't confuse this book as a serious representation of history and theology which it most certainly is not
this is camp and camp and more camp but bruce would n't touch it bad acting racial stereotypes and more bad acting on the up side the was n't that bad and i bet they had fun making this thing plot goes something like this evil movie theatre traps people to turn them into demons to take over the world or something like that warning ! ! ! ! this movie will not scare you ! ! ! i give it 2 on the because this really is what camp is about just not good camp not much for memorable lines however the pimp steals the show
i am a huge argento fan but come on folks this movie just stinks there 's more corn in this flick than the state of kansas the single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something there are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which argento 's uncanny editing and camera work shine otherwise its a feast for the idiots green blood bad and all definately not one to purchase for the collection
i would have given this movie 5 stars instead of is without a doubt the scariest movie ive ever seen in my was originaly released in reason im giving it one the movie demons on dvd is not the exact same movie released on vhs video in have redone it on taken mosalot of the gore and hard rock out of the reason is anchor movie was originaly distibuted by new world anchor bay got there hands ahold of this mordern marvel of terror and redone the movie they cut out alot of the gore alot of the original rock music was completely taken out when the womans on the theatre stage and transforming into a see a bright lite shot on her and you can see when her tounge shoots out thats its a mechanical the orginal the lighting was kept dark and they may have been the you are one of the lucky ones to hold the original 1985 release of demons on vhs from new video you have without a doubt the scariest horror movie of all your one of the unfortunate ones to get the new dvd you will be left in the dark on what was once a true horror happen to have the 1985 copy of in the aqctuall year of vdieo store went out of buisness in my home remember the day they got it in 1985 like it waqs purchased the some 20 year old copy from them in copys about had it its 21 years wwish i could find an oruginal u nolonger can get it wonder if they have done the same things to demons 2 the nightmare returns i wonder if they cut and edited it 2 talk about being crapped on your looking for the original demons first off saty away from the for teh video and make sure it says 1985 on it and not 1999 on the
this movie takes a really long time to come to its conclusion there are three separate tales here and each comes together at the very end then the movie abruptly ends my dvd had english subtitles but i feel sorry for those people who did n't have them or who do n't speak japanese the best part of this movie is a nice shot of yuki kudoh topless in bed with her boyfriend the rest of the movie was long and drawn out i 'd recommend skipping it unless it 's a really slow saturday night or if you are a huge yuki kudoh fan
hello whoever mastered this great film ruined it by forgetting or refusing to provide english subtitles for the japanese and italian characters how can such a thing happen if you find the vhs buy it maybe some day someone will make the corrections until then avoid this dvd
though the dvd has some really nice extras interviews etc the restoration leaves a lot to be desired much clarity is lost from the original almost blurry like multiple images that do n't properly align the actors all have zombie eyes '' not really watchable now shopping for the unrestored version
the tiltle threw me off since i did not know who danny gatton was expecting to learn some amazing rhythm patterns and great strummings techniques because of all the other reviews that i have read but all i saw was the same pluck and pick patterns and different jazz chords some blues chords as well guess you have to be a fan of to enjoy the know i did not enjoy it at all or really learned anything i could not bare to sit through the whole thing but i forced myself only part i enjoyed was about one minute worth when had the acoustic guitar he used an electric guitar throughout the dvd and used a really cool rhythm
this disc is like a whitman 's candy sampler it has a lot of different things but a lot of the things you do n't really want the film covers kids high schoolers college ball and college controversies aba nba through all its decades harlem globetrotters the street game and stars country boys indiana basketball retired old timers hanging in florida current stars marketing are there any hoop videos that do n't talk about sneaker brands public relations fireworks cheerleaders guys on trampolines women 's basketball whew none of these subjects is studied in depth if you 've followed basketball for a while you know and have seen most of this the subject sampling seems to jump all over the place so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want i 'd rather see a dvd star profile jordon iverson or nba at 50 '' or spike lee 's movie or hoop dreams '' etc 1 love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a wilson basketball or it seems like something you 'd see on sunday tv after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends in short 1 love '' is a decent sampling but nothing to sink your teeth into
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate strangers with all their flaws abundantly clear meeting once a week for encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate '' tawdry pathetic feel of their relationship naturally one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later anonymity is not good enough anymore
just imagine what the trevor howard celia johnson would could have been like if they had this freedom also imagine the artist 'hair ' dresser and the err focus puller on this one 's set no no no ! although rather brave who the heck cares it 's all very natural and somewhat vaguely contemporary but really why bother as our beloved peter finch i think said in sunday bloody sunday '' here come those boring old again ! '' as for safe sex the lady during a or two breathlessly demands 'protection ' from the ' unrealistic regarding the intensity of their meeting s and their obsession with each other 's body parts simone signoret and laurence harvey were by far more interesting in their plastic raincoats on a windswept beach ditto kerr and lancaster also were far more tortured in their versions along the same theme then we will always have intermezzo '' '' in the realm of the senses ''
the story is ok but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much but if your looking for some raunchy sex there is a oral sex scene in it
this movie was not enjoyable although it had been recommended it 's very depressing and hard to follow the one good point of the movie was that it provided an interesting review of china 's political history
a good travelogue of the region but only a few short minutes of the canal itself title is very misleading spends precious little time on the building of the canal the experience of transversing it et al focuses on the geography and culture of the cities in the area and the culture etc but very dispappointing regarding the canal itself
comedy comes in many forms everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire and in just friends '' there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types first the movie wants to be a comedy the sight gags are plentiful the physical comedy abundant and often cruel and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic however the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart these elements have been combined successfully in the past '' there 's something about mary '' jumps right to mind here we get something far less successful first the good news there are legitimate laughs to be had in just friends '' and that was a pleasant surprise if you do n't care about character development and just want inane humor you could do worse than this movie and if the sight of ryan reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you check this out right away sadly it 's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite there is nothing real at stake here to care about and the blame for this falls squarely on reynolds ' character i 'll use the word character lightly here reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working the problem however is that he 's not in sitcoms anymore he 's making movies unfortunately and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character here he plays a celebrity insider a successful trendy record executive and yet he 's not believable as trendy successful or professional his character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero you never know or understand him he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag it 's too bad really because amy smart as his love interest is playing a character i 'm not usually a fan but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down but it 's anna faris that i 'm going to single out for the most inspired performance the funniest bits to me revolve around her character a shallow insane pop star sure it 's an easy target but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious gusto that she is easily a cast standout again some humor no emotion if you do n't expect much from your comedy you might just like this the fatal flaw for me is that i felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship but did n't do anything to make it real
in spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women the comedian bernie mac stole this picture ! he played his part of the low life club owning hustler with perfect timing and high humor he made this movie enjoyable to watch
rebecca miller spins three tales of woman who decide to take their lives into their own hands in brief vignettes featuring three contemporary actresses kyra sedgwick parker posey and fairuza balk escaping situations of largely their own making i have never been particularly impressed with kyra sedgwick but i felt that her role and performance was the standout among the three here as an abused woman who finally had enough abuse she decides to leave and take the lessons she learned in dealing with her abusive life to move forward and she is excellent as much as she is convincing parker posey plays an editor who is given a plum opportunity which in the end will alienate her from her husband and most of the trappings she has come to detest in her own life she has chosen this path in life it seems to combat her feelings against her family although i generally appreciate posey 's roles this one did not seem particularly a stretch fairuza balk was good as usual
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love
i ca n't stand this movie it 's one of the worset the acting is horrible it 's dark gloomy and so boring it 's fun to watch and make fun of it but thats about all i do not recommend it i would give it zero stars if it was possible the child actress mary '' and then the older grown up mary '' actress is n't suitable she does n't even look like she could have been the same person or type how awful ! watch another version this one is a waste of time and money !
while a wonderful story this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch a bit hard to understand why the child of two english parents would speak like she 's from new jersey ! i could n't watch the end of this it was so bad recommend you see another version
i watched this movie in religion and was dissapointed that it did n't follow the book i read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available but now seeing this one again i 'm pretty sure i saw this before i was annoyed at how much it changed the book i think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties the way mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous also i do n't like colin 's strange like air i had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and did n't even remotely resemble the children do n't get this version if your a purist
the movie is great but the dvd leaves a lot to be desired i have to use captioning for the hearing impaired '' and i am not of latino heritage this movie does not provide captioning for the hearing impaired in english but in spanish the producer s of this dvd apparently do n't care much for the english hearing impaired
this movie is at the top of my list unfortunately it 's the 'worst movie of ' list that 's right ladies and gentlemen friends and supporters of this film this movie is trash and not just for cuba 's horribly annoying acting it 's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable come on do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands and if all you base a relationship on is the end justifying the means well i wish you luck with your next soul
i have read into thin air '' and watched the discovery channel series on mt everest so i received this dvd with great anticipation however my excitement dissolved quickly due to the cheesy music awful special effects lack of drama and poor landscape visuals i was completely bored it was a waste of 45 minutes
our teacher made us sit through this minute load of junk one day during class one day let me say i only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside first of all the plot has so many holes in it i seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it secondly i believe i watched an episode of teletubbies once and laughed more then than i did during this movie finally the movie is more bland than a block of tofu no action no drama not the slightest trace of good humor
not a great movie someone made a comment in these reviews '' have you ever screwed up unintentionally in a relationship '' and all i can think is please the guy in this movie goes out with another girl cause he wants to sleep with her even tho he doesnt want to admit it to himself but he does admit it to his friend he knew what he was doing when he went out with that other girl it wasnt unintentional he was a jerk and he deserved what she put him thru i found the main actress very funny and i dont understand why she wanted this jerk back wont she keep wondering if hes straying its kinda sad if a guy with a that pretty strays what hope is there i suppose not all guys are jerks this movie was a rollercoaster shes showing his whos boss and he shows her they make eachother jealous blah blah
this should have been at least a double disc dvd with alot more insight and depth and alot more matches like when luger beat hogan on nitro for the title in 1997 mick foley 's title win along with the contraversial poke of doom '' match with hogan and nash both i might add were aired on the same is alot of stuff and factiods missing on this one folks
for something that spanned so many years to sum it up in 90 minutes is just rediculous there was n't enough commentary by enough wrestlers and there was n't enough clips of good moments from both sides
i did n't enjoy the film i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what 's the difference it 's king lear a downer of a play there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he 's wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he 's an annoyance
night of the creeps rules all slither is basically a somewhat rip off slugs zombies aliens play by play rip night of the creeps was able to accomplish so much more with so much less plus it had tom atkins see creeps '' and you 'll see what i mean
i think this film wants to make you vomit i do n't know about you but that is not a quality i am looking for in my films being scared is fine being in suspense is great vomiting is not i really think that is what this film was going for it has some pretty disgusting moments while i was watching it i kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes in fact i am feeling it now as i write this review and think about the movie the story runs like this a meteor falls to earth it has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device this of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine in the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into looking creatures or in the case of the head alien just a big pile of disgustingness the idea itself is n't a bad one and its executed in a relatively skillful way in fact the idea is much more original than many other horror movies but as i said before it 's just too disgusting to be really enjoyable this movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories
i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am i thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself the degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and jay and silent bob 's appearances do n't help much i really liked the original degrassi series so i was disappointed by this dvd there are some funny moments in the extras '' section of the dvd but i would still only recommend this as a rent '' or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan
unable to see the movie received the original shipment and later a replacement and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
sara ivanhoe does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating poses she points out common mistakes and gives helpful advice on how to correct them the twelve poses are a good foundation for a beginner doing yoga for the first time it is worth watching but only once the problem is that she spends over a minute between each pose talking about them rather than telling the viewer what to do as they are doing it she demonstrates talks talks some more then she tells you to begin each pose is held for 6 breaths i 'd much rather that she explained things as she was doing them sure then you may not get everything the first time but at least the program would not drag on as it does the other thing i did n't like about this was the boing '' sound effects of the for dummies tips if i 'm doing yoga to relax i want to hear soothing music not annoying popup sound effects if you have never done any yoga before this may be worth renting to watch once however i would not recommend buying it you wo n't care to watch it again
camp stories '' is a movie that ironically does not have a story let along stories david played by zach zaylor is forced to attend a jewish camp when he would rather stay home and watch movies all summer his parents tell him the reason he must go is because your jewish ! '' i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when i heard that line david quickly establishes himself as a when he accepts a challenge from the reigning rafterball champ paul kris park and beats him from there david 's camp adventures just get more and more exciting yeah right the movie suffers from a lack of anything that would keep a viewer interested the actors just plod along in a very episodic manner there is literally nothing that happens in this movie that you will remember 5 minutes after you finish watching it i served as an extra in this movie and was unfortunate enough to see how poorly this film was made how they got the actors they did elliot gould jason biggs jerry stiller is beyond me but sadly i do n't think any actor could have saved this script
when i was a small girl of six i saw the film fern gully in the theater and it scared me sh uh poopless ! ! it was an ok flick up until the horrific smog monster appeared killing all nature and singing about acid rain and sucking all living creatures dry and spitting them out like spinach ! ! ! this movie traumatized me and gave me nightmares for at least a year or two ! ! this movie is a nightmare ride and if you really want to show your kids a movie with a message about preserving the environment and living in harmony with nature you 'd be better off with miyazaki 's castle in the sky '' than with this film that is unless you want your kid to be scared for
i am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf i had to return it
