great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the sc entertaining and educational
there is no questioning this film is done very well that said it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone if you are not a fan of cliches stay away from this there are tons of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background and maybe not everyone can handle that most of the performances are incredible my favorite happens to be jeff daniels one performance that does n't do it for me is martin sheen he shares a lot of scenes with tom berenger and it seems like berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat thomas howell has a steady part but you wo n't recognize him as the kid from the outsiders great battle scenes especially the big one in the open field at the end
after the nobility of abraham lincoln 's verbal tribute to gettysburg 's fallen there is not much else that could do those men justice yet gettysburg does so this 1993 film second in a civil war trilogy that begins with gods and generals and concludes with last full measure is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess to put it as succinctly as possible this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history a film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern pennyslvania 's momentary appearance as a killing field in america 's most costly war this was its linchpin battle tom berenger and martin sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of confederate generals sheen 's robert lee carries a mountain 's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more virginia gentlemen and texas cowboys to their deaths jeff daniels far outshines his earlier representation of maine 's coronel chamberlain the wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of bowdoin college the panoramic battle scenes provided legions of civil war reenactors with their glorious opportunity one that with the exception of a handful of volunteers who could n't help grinning while they were being shot down seized the day with remarkable poignance this one is for seeing again and again remembering and bowing one 's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood
if you 're into the civil war this is the movie for you it tells the battle from both sides it follows the activities of both sides this is a must have for fans of the civil war
this is one of the best movie about the civil war i 've ever seen it is the most instructive realistic with very good actors playing in it ! for once just like in gods and generals '' the movie is more focused on the southern side which is not very often the case i am a fan of this part of the history and especially of the south and i was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end
almost a complete scope of the battle of the size of the battle in numbers and cause would have like to have heard lincoln's address at the end for now it is a rememberance of the dead of both sides of the battle that i think unitesw us now into this great nation
this 1993 movie based on michael shaara 's book the killer angels is over four hours long but it uses that time well to document this critical civil war battle i used the word ' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary it was even filmed at the gettysburg national military park when you see the fight for little round top or pickett 's charge or another fight you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened thousands of civil war play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle these amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows as a high school history teacher i was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class when i timed pickett 's charge i realized it is shown in real time those confederate soldiers charged into union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie read the killer angels and then see this outstanding movie kyle prat
despite the chintzy unconvincing facial hair jeff daniels ' being the exception martin sheen 's interpretation of lee 's accent and his beard obvious saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war generalized and largely inaccurate interpretations of the underlying history of the war and hopelessly ridiculously wildly attempts atnew england accents the film still works i understand that to get a film produced and distributed it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice and thomas howell 's performance well let 's just say that his beard was more convincing than his acting jeff daniels however does an excellent job in large part because he does n't try to convince you he 's from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers using every stereotype associated with nasal instead of focusing on the nasality of the ne accent think of sheen in the missiles of octobah daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief but then here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner are n't the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production i think the story works because there 's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle but the movie makers either did n't have the budget for gore maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards or decided to err on the side of forbearance if gettysburg had been made years later it might have benefited from the newer style of as in saving private ryan thin red line or gladiator it falls a bit short of that however finally it should be noted that the seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war 's historical underpinnings opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery they fought to preserve the union which is a very different concept abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south 's hand but it was not the sole cause of the war the movie dumbs this down a bit making the message more like what you 'd find in a text book the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war the north absolutely needed to win it but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie still and all the film is very watchable and due credit should be given to the arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film
alright im sure you already know what its about if not then just read above because im here trying to tell you why you should watch it i know ill get this out of the way fast just watch this movie for what it is not what you want it to be ! people argue that its not scary or that the twist ending was horrible its not a horror movie its not suposed to scare you its a love story and listen to this the twist ending its not suposed to be a surprise its suposed form this whole movie its suposed to define who these characters are and what they are trying to do this is a story of love and of hope and innocence i just dont see how people who are fans of shyamalans other movies can say i hated the ending very predictable '' because fans you know what shyamalan does you know from seeing signs that hes a deep writer that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be so please if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics or your friends then see it anyway why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like or dont like sure many didnt like it some didnt even understand it but that doesnt mean you wont like it you just have to try it out if you havent had the end ruined for you thats even better because you still have this whole movie to look forward to and if you dont enjoy it than fine but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it i know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews if you enjoy a good love story or even an type of suspence movie then im sure you will enjoy it but its not for everyone im sure if you get bored easily or if you dont have an imagination this is a must have for any shyamalan film and then theres the soundtrack which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film who can make the music be a character in the movie but before i leave trust me dont watch this thinking its a horror movie because its not thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film
i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that 's exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would 've moved along at a better pace but still a great movie
i once thought i was almost alone in liking this creepy and fun 2004 film but the fact is it seems to be growing on people it just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring the village a life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there 's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise no i wo n't give it away even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is but if you do n't know be careful about reading any farther what i grasped about the village aside from embracing a story i liked for itself and for its ending which i did n't see coming was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place and recreate reality to suit their preferences think about that for a minute people go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today for instance with its violence its corporate intrusions its governmental omnipresence and here we saw a successful experiment in utopian existence set in 1890 and i found that wonderful i also loved the scenery the muted color schemes the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life the performances of bryce dallas howard joachim phoenix and william hurt were also highly underrated never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand i liked the village from the first day i saw it and continue to think well of it even now
if you are expecting to be scared out of your pants do n't this movie is not scary but more suspenseful it is a great movie with awesome twists and anyone who said that they figured out this movie is a liar this movie is perfectly written acted and directed see this movie
it 's strange this just came on fx and once it was on i was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing even though i 've already seen it in the theatres during its initial release run and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around even for all of the bad press that this movie got and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror this truly is one of my favorites from night shyamalan this along with lady in the water '' another must have for me is a movie that i feel compelled to add to my collection as the other reviewers state it 's not truly scary but more a suspenseful film as i actually find all of shyamalan 's movies to be in my humble opinion he 's not trying to provide movies to halloween marathons but movies that are suspenseful and as annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers there 's thought put into each of his films unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like hostel '' and those damned saw '' movies enough already ! at least after seeing this in the theatre i felt that i 'd gotten my money 's worth for the ticket price and this is definitely a movie that i feel i could watch repeatedly in my opinion the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film do n't buy this if you 're looking for a horror like the exorcist '' if that 's what you want buy and watch the exorcist '' if you 're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen buy this movie even if you know what happens in the end i 'm sure you 'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time
it was a delight to see this childhood memory again and in pristine quality with color if you prefer it in original black white turn the color down on your tv set it brings this series to a whole new generation of fans my nephews nieces would n't watch it in b w
i 'm not sure why sony which now owns i dream of jeannie decided to colorize the first season of this series whatever the reason you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on that the original version of the first season is worth a lot more the reason for that is simple i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in and for a television fan like myself that 's the only way to watch the first season the episodes themselves are just as i remember seeing them since i was n't around in 1965 i 'm pretty sure i 've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here but to me they 're still pretty good the theme music in my opinion is every bit as good as the second theme introduced when jeannie went to color in 1966. the one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that sony stripped off the old screen gems animation from the end of every episode that logo was attached to so many classic shows from the and and it is consistenly rated along with viacom 's old blue v of doom as the scariest logo in the history of television the new sony outro does n't pack the same punch still if you liked jeannie way back when you 'll love it now especially since you can watch it anytime you like without commercial interruption
there was something special about the first season and this has been colorized and it realy is great the way they did was a few moments you could tell it was a bit fake but accross the board it realy has been a great effort to get it looking like this and if you dont like the color version simply turn off the color on your tv ! the pilot episode is a personal favorite of mine how it got things that bit when she came out of toney 's room with that long shirt ! oh those thigh 's ! amazingly barbera eden got pregnant during this season and had to wear an extra veil to cover up her pregnancy i have been in love with that woman since i was about 5
like lighten up already 2 '' said in the review of this dvd i want historical accruacy i wrote my opinions of the colorized versions of vintage b w shows in a review of bewitched the complete second season which is available in a colorized version to summarize that review would an antique dealer ruin a valuable antique mahogany piece of furniture by painting it a bright red
this is one of my all time favorite tv shows although same in concept and scope than bewitched this shows superior cast and performances tower over bewitched i believe this show was much more funnier than bewitched barbara eden stars as jeannie and larry hagman stars as cap later anthony nelson and bill daily stars as roger healy nelsons best friend this dvd set covers the entire season 30 episodes of the series since this series season was shot in black and white this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set as far as the video and audio go the video looks fantastic episodes are clean and sharp with no compression no dirt or scratches noticeable audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound all episodes are complete and uncut the pilot episode includes a audio commentary with larry hagman barbara eden and bill daily it 's nice and pleasant but not very informative this is the main problem i have about this set no information ! ! to me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars the 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes on the back of the cases you get episode title of each episode and small description of each one i think there should be more info than this so i had hoped when i played the dvds got to the main menu and selected an episode i would get a small amount of trivia some more details such as production date broadcast date and cast listing with special guest stars no such luck i had hoped for much more info about each episode you get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with sidney sheldon larry hagmen barbara eden and bill daily which is a nice but short special feature it 's nice to see them together and still very good friends they were the backbone of this great show along with the late hayden roarke hayden roarke was wonderful as alfred bellows i would have loved for him to have been there too in closing this is still a great set to have and i intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show i highly recommend the dvd version of this classic show
i love i dream of jeannie it 's just so wholesome and entertaining at the same time the only thing i wish they 've included in the dvd is english subtitles sometimes if you 've missed what the characters are saying at least you can always check the subtitles but other than that i 'm very glad they 've put the series out on dvd
i 'm waiting for the release of season 3 the best one ! this is where jeannie 's evil sister shows up for the first time so silly so much fun sweet memories
finally another of my favorite sitcoms is released on dvd ! i 've enjoyed watching after of this gem '' of a series for years for quite awhile the first season was not even a part of the syndicated episodes barbara eden is fantastic as jeannie poor tony nelson did n't realize how lucky he really was ! larry hagman played the part of anthony nelson with great comedic timing larry and barbara together made a fantastic team ! i love the interviews with barbara larry and bill daily even today the three of them come across as best friends it 's no wonder they were so good together in the series ! i dream of jeannie will always be one of the funniest shows ever to grace our tv screens ! i 'm not thrilled about the movie version soon to be i 'll stick with what is original ! now i will wait for one more of my favorite patty duke show
wonderful my favorite sitcom i wish that they played i dream of jeannie on the television at prime time instead of the junk they have now you do not have to monitor this program it is one that almost any age can enjoy
as a young white boy growing up on the navajo reservation was very wonderful this movie brought back many wonderful memories the navajo friends i had all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of northern arizona this movie is a great movie it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880 's some what as i felt when we moved to northern arizona in 1960. the people were wonderful to grow up with this movie is a great movie the only problem i had with the dvd is that to see the bonus features you have to have a special computer i would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie if they could have just put it on the dvd i would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts other wise i would have given this movie a 5 star rating
love this movie caught some of it on tv one week so then did a search on amazon and brought the movie family entertainment loosly based on the real life frank t hopkins who did more to save the wild mustang than any other
hidalgo is based upon a true story so it 's no wonder it 's thrilling truth being stranger than fiction and all although it 's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened frank hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great bedouin horse race of the middle east known as the ocean of fire '' in the 1890 's this wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours yet never bores and your interest should never waver the international cast is terrific led by viggo mortensen in a subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a cowboy ' we 've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering john wayne to the laconic clint eastwood but with viggo 's frank hopkins we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke and it 's all the more interesting because frank hopkins is n't all cowboy half of him is native american this internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to hopkins balancing the tensions of native americans with the us government of the time the film explores frank hopkin 's journey between two worlds that of a half native american with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in wild bill hickcock 's show all while having to live in the white man 's world when he 's invited to participate in the bedouin race frank soon discovers there 's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions where women must hide their faces behind veils much like he 's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action with fun and authenticity viggo must have definitely lived '' horses for the film irregardless of his prior expertise with them he clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he 's totally capable and always convincing hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a tv series this beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it 's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance apparently lost by audiences in it 's initial theatrical release hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover
surprisingly ' released in did n't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings or audience appeal only now two years after its release is this fantastic film finding on dvd the adoring audience it so richly deserves i was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time i have come to the following conclusion it was all aragorn 's fault yes that 's correct it was aragorn 's fault here are the reasons why i believe this to be true ' was viggo mortensen 's first film following his role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of lord of the rings ' his long matted hair scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer the shock of seeing viggo as frank hopkins american cowboy in a funny hat and bandana much shorter cropped hair clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful ' to handle viggo 's fan base simply was n't ready to give up the image of the king of yet unable to accept the new look people stayed away from the theaters thus turning disney 's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error to put it plan and simple ' came out too soon if you 're finally willing to move beyond the aragorn persona and see a fast moving well acted beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell i invite you to give ' a viewing viggo is perfect as the half indian half white man who rides the little pinto that never gives up and omar sharif delivers his best performance since of arabia ' he 's alert witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh sometimes whimsical sheikh riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the american wild west it 's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part also excellent performances by zuleikha robinson as jazira adoni maropis as sakr and a whole cast of exotic fascinating characters participating in the torturous mile desert horse race across the ocean of fire '' highly recommended
the lord of the rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money but without the awards and critical recognition of the lotr movies not so with viggo mortensen right after lotr he followed with this awesome adventure story by disney coming out the summer after pirates of the caribbean this was supposed to be disney 's next big summer adventure hit unfortunately it flopped at the box office luckily it has made a comeback on the dvd market which is where this reviewer saw it all in all it is a great movie and probably one of the best movies disney has produced in a long while judging from its ratings here on amazon and on in short this movie is about frank hopkins american horserider who is mired in guilt and self remorse along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery a trip to the arabian desert for a race frank takes the challenge with his horse hidalgo and of they go the race across the arabian desert tests both rider and horse and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like disney could have created we have the girl full of innocence and inner strength a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs an arrogant prince with no moral bounds etc etc it all reminds our protagonist of his days in montana ! during the course of the race which frank and hidalgo win of course both of them are tested to the limit the movie ends on a triumphal note for both the rider redeems his guilt by freeing hidalgo from human ownership forever and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals the soundtrack is awesome the cinematography is great the dialogue is realistic and for once a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area ! my compliments to disney and the cast and crew of this movie i highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up
in this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of frank hopkins viggo mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether frank hopkins actually existed is irrelevant what is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted frank hopkins is an accomplished rider he has been a dispatch rider for the army a pony express rider and he has been in buffalo bill 's wild west show frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile ocean of fire a race that has been held for one thousand years after the obligatory refusal all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero he travels by sea to the middle east a side note the movie begins with the infamous wounded knee massacre the memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts frank i will discuss these distractions more later in this review this movie finally comes into its own when the ocean of fire race begins several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race numerous attempts are made to kill frank during the race of course frank manages to survive all these attempts he also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess and to save his horse from spikes big cats and bullets not to mention heat thirst and hunger nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining the title of the movie comes from the mustang named hidalgo hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie the only issue i had with this movie was the distractions i thought the wounded knee massacre while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie to be a distraction from the race even though frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were i also thought the release of the wild mustangs by frank could have been handled more succinctly though i admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the midwest was inspiring throwing in all the details about jazira the daughter of sheikh riyadh played by the great omar sharif were further distractions the result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly i thought viggo mortenson was great as aragorn in the lord of the rings movies he does an equally good job as frank hopkins enjoy the race enjoy the rescue of the princess fast forward through the rest
i have to say that i really enjoyed this film it is well done and not to mention beautifully shot it has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of hollywood these days most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed this film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint if you love horses adventure beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse then please do see it and lets face it ladies viggo mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him he is a very good actor and an underated one at that so sit back pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure and admire one of god 's most majestic creations horse and viggo mortensen ! !
here 's an epic '' movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid such as zhivago and lawrence of arabia interesting to note that omar sharif was in this movie and zhivago several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because thanks to the previews they thought it would be an adventure story such as the mummy '' well it was n't and it was way too slow for them frankly i thought the slow '' parts were the best and overall thought the film had just the right amount of action instead of overdoing it as the recent mummy pictures did another big plus was the cinematography this is a beautifully filmed movie stunning in some parts another good point is the language hardly a swear word on the negative side there was the usual political correctness a la dances with wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at wounded knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys the horse race had some credibility problems too as hidalgo '' came back from the dead not once but twice to race like secretariat ! anyway if you are looking for a adventure story with storytelling and no language problems this film is for you and the rest of the family
this is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show of course i also like that it is based on a real person
great workout for our kids us parents too to follow very effective and our 4 kids from baby to jump in and kick the coach is very optimistic and positive i also like the extra defense techniques shown to children it was very much worth the money good on rainy and snowy days
wish this vid had another workout amazing interest at first got old quickly
i would highly recommend this video if you are looking for something to motivate kids and that they can keep up with and have fun but still get a good it is based on martial arts but does not include violence toward other people instead he picks apples and oranges and kicks soccer balls the video is also split up for example warm up and cool down so it is easy to pause and grab a drink of water if you need one
my kids absolutly love this program the children on the program are clearly having fun which makes it so much more fun for the viewer especially when the viewers are children themselves the guy leading the group is just awesome with kids he interacts with them throughout the entire program and really makes it a lot of fun my kids have seen their share of kid 's exercise programs and until we saw this one they were n't very happy with any of them this program really makes them feel good about themselves and really makes them feel good about exercising i have seen this video in the 1 spot for quite a while but because it was priced a little higher than some of the other videos i thought i would save a few dollars try them instead big mistake ! ! ! now i wish i would have bought this video first and saved the money i spent on the other videos kick to get fit for kids is truly worth the few extra dollars this is difinitely a case where you get what you have paid for a few extra dollars a much better product atleast in this case it does !
i bought this mainly for my 7 yr old son but even the older children i care for i run a family daycare really enjoy this all the kids give it two thumbs way up
i purchased this for my son and we love it the moves are very easy to follow and extremely he compares the martial arts moves to picking apples and oranges versus upper cuts and jabs the kids in the video are just kids they do n't perform everything perfectly so as not to make your little feel incompetent great for all ages
this program is simply the best kid 's program i 've ever seen i really ca n't say a lot that has n't already been said in other reviews i just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is a couple of quick points that make this program so special are the instructor the program itself and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having and the amount of fun my children have doing the program the instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program and also to the viewers at home he is funny but yet professional with his instruction and really does a good job with the kids the program itself is like nothing i 've ever seen before the movements are a combination of karate techniques with a approach aerobic movements and basic physical education activities it 's a very nice blend and it really flows together well and last but certainly not least this program is fun to do and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with this is terrific program
this program is simply the best kid 's exercise video i 've seen period ! ! ! ! i usually do n't write reviews simple because most of the kid 's fitness programs i 've seen are n't worth the time to write about but kick to get fit for kids is completely different than anything i 've ever seen the film quality was very good and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids he 's truly a natural with kids one of the things i liked best about this program was the tempo flow and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program what i mean is it did n't appear that he had memorized a script of what to say or that he was reading word for word from a script he just went with the flow and any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun anything less than that will effect the quality of what you 're doing now do n't get me wrong this program was well rehearsed extremely well put together but the instructor kids were truly going with the flow having fun which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program kids enjoy watching kids having fun and if the kids on the program are having fun then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun it does n't get much simpler than this unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short kick to get fit for kids is simply the best ! check it out your kids will love it
one of the best movies i 've seen everybody does a great job in portraying this sensitive material in a very real and gutsy way i 've seen this movie three times i think and each time have found it not only entertaining but reminding that as a society we still have a lot of work to do on healing our human need for hatred and fear
grisham once said he wrote his other books the firm et so he could afford to write important books like this one upon which the movie s based matthew mcconaghey gives a fantastic performance and why has n't hollywood ever ever given him another part this good ! thought provoking great acting great story highly recommen
if you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you it really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause
with a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit i found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers the story is a brutally honest one about racism in mississippi in the year 1995. a young black girl ten years old is raped and beaten by two white and when the young girls father samuel jackson takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he 's arrested and a trial is held the film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly jake mcconaughey as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed kkk as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty the film calls into account morality over law whats right and wrong is n't always black and white and not so easily determined acting on all fronts is strong but it 's jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through kevin spacey sandra bullock oliver platt keifer donald sutherland ashley judd and chris cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast
this is one of my favorite movies besides containing a stellar cast matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock sammuel jackson oliver platt donald and keifer sutherland kevin spacey you get the idea is there a cast member that is n't a biggie the casting is genious and the acting incredible it 's suspenseful deep very slightly it 's the perfect movie even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you a time to kill 's plot is pretty simply explained in the deep south a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks who almost kill her a young white lawyer and father matthew mcconaughey as jake brigance is sickened at the news and does n't quite know what to think when the little girl 's father sammuel jackson as carl lee hailey pays him a visit and asks if he 'd help him if he were in a tight spot '' the next day as the two are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment carl lee hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher jake brigance agrees to defend hailey as his murder trial begins the insanity plea is used to give the jury an excuse to aquit '' but in my opinion i think it was quite legitimate what father would n't be driven insane under the circumstances the rest of the movie is carl lee hailey 's trial and the surrounding drama as kkk violence emerges led by kiefer sutherland and jake 's life and home are in danger his relationship with his wife strained and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle my favorite scene it might come as a surprise but my favorite scene is when the prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial he was caught in the knee by a stray bullet and now has half a leg after the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against carl lee and establish unerring identity of the shooter the defence asks him two questions do you think carl lee intentionally shot you '' no '' '' do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did '' he did what i would have done '' but it does n't end there as the policeman remember he 's missing a leg because of what carl lee hailey did becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like carl lee did he starts screaming to the jury to turn him loose he 's a hero ! '' i think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes albeit there are many others too great acting by chris cooper as the policeman forgive if i rambled i love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas star studded john grisham suspense all around good you need to see this
every writer is important a writer that has views characters and exciting trial cases this movie is originally based off of john grisim 's first novel a novel that he sturggled to get out there and then finally had it it 's a powerful story that has a very dark setting there 's rascism there 's fights there 's deaths everything that this wolrd wants to avoid i think samuel jackson played a really powerful performacne and i hope he got an oscar for this role just to warn you though that there are images in here that are hard to see i myself fastforwarded one scene because i could n't handle it it 's near the begining but i hope you people enjoy the cast of characters and get captured by this huge story
this is by far john grisham 's best books and movies of all although this was john 's first book it was n't successful until one of more of his other books became successful after the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list then comes the subject of making this book into a movie when john grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive he felt that without his input the movie could not reflect what grisham was trying to present in the book after several of john grisham 's books were made into movies and were successful i knew it was only a matter of time before a time to kill '' would be on the big screen this movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because john grisham had some influence over the production the movie has an all star cast including samuel jackson matthew mcconaughey and kevin spacey this movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years this dvd should be apart of everyone 's movie collection as this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come the movie will also be
john grisham 's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the south was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by joel schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by akiva goldsman the reporting of an act of violence by an african american father whose daughter had been kidnapped brutally beaten raped and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony even on a small scale if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit matthew mcconaughey is the rookie white lawyer ashley judd his wife samuel jackson the father sandra bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists mcconaughey kevin spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing mcconaughey oliver platt as mcconaughey 's sidekick donald sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help mcconaughey find the truth justice knows patrick mcgoohan as the implacable judge and kiefer sutherland as the kkk redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town it is a fine cast and schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'great movies ' but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias recommended grady harp january 0
john grisham 's novel a time to kill '' is closly adapted into a major motion picture by director joel schumacher rated r '' for language and violent content including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of a '' list stars samuel jackson plays carl lee hailey the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment young and inexperienced local attorney jake brigance played by matthew mcconaughey in one of his first major roles agrees to defend carl lee against the smarmey district attroney rufus buckley played by kevin spacey brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of sandra bullock playing a law student oliver platt a morally devoid divorce attorney and donald sutherland a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave brigance his first job as the plot builds the community begins to takes sides in the case the kkk is called in to intimidate carl lee 's defense team and the naacp enters to counteract the klan 's actions in some reviews the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable this reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book without revealing any key plot details let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the deep south in a accurate way there 's plenty of action few down moments and sparkling performances by a great cast ! if you liked the book you will enjoy a time to kill ''

i really love this dvd it 's wonderful having all the 'rocks'in one place ! you can play them linearly or randomly or by category i 'm enjoying the heck out of it and i 'm almost sixty ! supposedly i bought it for my autistic son he loves it too
my son is 6 and i bought this for him to help him prep for grade he loves it and watches it every morning before school he chooses to watch it over nickelodeon and cn after he watches one or two videos we discuss them and later we sing them he has already learned heaps of math grammar and us history the latter is important because we live in japan and i 'm trying to see that he learns about his other '' nation i also want to see him maintain his english as the school system pours more and more japanese on him school house rock achieves all of these goals and more the 2 disk set is also with alot of extra animations this is a for any child and as a i never get tired of watching it either solid songs engaging funny animation
another generation is now able to enjoy and learn
years ago i used to watch schoolhouse rock with my children and recommended it to my students as well today it is entertaining and educating the next generation of our family 's youngsters the special anniversary edition will be a treasure that parents and grandparents can enjoy with the kids it 's money
this series of short videos is a great tool for parents to teach their kids various topics math how our form of government should work and history i remember it well
finally every one of the schoolhouse rock as well as a few i do n't remember
this is a good video for kids it worked for me along time ago i learned the preamble from this video and to this day if i need to recite the preamble i sing it not only the preamble you learn spanish bill to a law conjunctions this video is timeless if you have kids get this for them makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them

if you do n't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection in my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released

walt disney 's alice in wonderland is one of my favorite animated films some great characters in this one the smoking caterpillar chesire cat the queen of hearts the mad hatter and of course that busy white rabbit alice in wonderland is such a sweet sensitive and quite risque film clearly the caterpillar is n't smoking incense but this film is classic i love it so much i ca n't wait til my nephew starts watching this film other disney films i enjoy include the little mermaid beauty and the beast cinderella and the lady and the tramp i highly recommend alice in wonderland could this movie be any better i think not
disney 's alice in wonderland '' is one of their most underrated animated masterpieces that finally gets the 2 disc special edition treatment that it so very much deserves the animation is pleasing to the eyes the songs are pleasing to the ears and alice 's adventures are charming and interesting to behold the classic childhood story written my lewis carroll is given a brilliant boost with great animated characters that bring alice 's adventures to glorious life kathryn beaumont give 's alice a voice that is so sincere with each amazing discovery in the land of wonder so that the character seems more real than simply animated kathryn also does a great job as the voice for wendy in disney 's peter pan '' this dvd release is loaded with tons of extras that are very enjoyable to watch i especially like the walt disney tv special starring kathryn beaumont and bobby driscoll treasure island that introduces alice in wonderland '' to the public and features excerpts from song of the south '' and other disney films i highly recommend alice in wonderland the masterpiece edition '' to fans of classic disney animated films and to fans of animated childhood stories and fantasies alice in wonderland '' is a beautiful daydream that definitely should not be missed
not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by disney but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in carrol 's book here we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics and more often than not one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis alice realizes that something has happened but is not able to handle all this nonsense which in fact are just a product of her own mind most importantly i believe is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across and luckily by the end of the film you can ask yourself who am i
there 's certain sequences in disney films that are so memorable they tend to get parodied or they 're referenced more than the actual movie the spaghetti scene in lady and the tramp bambi 's mother in that movie or the pink elephant scene in dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films so it 's odd that so many of alice 's scenes are pop culture even when it did n't have the warmest welcome on release granted we 're not talking disney 's masterpiece level but still it 's quite a quirky movie alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water she follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of wonderland she ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including tweedledee and tweedledum the mad hatter queen of hearts talking flowers and the white rabbit even though it 's a film unto itself many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they 're just pop culture iconic scenes and of course the matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery the film however did n't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd it 's even written walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down this is probably the most atypical film disney 's released although other films such as emperor 's new groove or atlantis are quite different while those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song alice has a bunch of songs the imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils talking flowers tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing you can obviously tell why critics could n't understand it it 's still cited as one of disney 's more better smart '' films such as fantasia you should check it out of course but word of caution by no means are you going to see a quintessential disney classic but still you 'll probably like it and enjoy it probably
i loved this is a thinkers fluff or gore
i was very pleasantly surprised at this film denzel washington proves again that he can handle any role that he chooses to play in this case he plays homicide inspector lincoln rhyme who has been nearly paralyzed after suffering from an accident in the line of duty but now when a mysterious killer begins killing off people in a very peculiar matter he must team with a rookie cop angelina jolie to solve the crimes supporting cast includes queen latifah michael rooker mike mcglone luis guzman leland orser and ed o'neil i like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing and the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow to come up with something this perfect you must a genius while not really scary this suspense thriller is actually thrilling as opposed to the many number of thrillers '' that are not even thrilling example hangman thank you hollywood for giving us the bone collector this is a good one highly recommended
philip noyce is a very smart filmmaker and once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic denzel washington sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent angelina jollie to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of nyc smart clues notable shots first rate direction kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the nineties according the tradition of silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to the rear window '' if you carefully establish the visible connections due if james stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times denzel washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye the paradigm remains and just the form changes highly recommended
very interested and keeps you on the 'edge ' thru the entire movie !
denzel washington is great but angelina jolie he is even better the movie itself is pretty scary to tell you the truth it 's not pleasant there are some parts you do n't really need to see the plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gon na happen next i recommend watching it with somebody cause it 's not pretty but it 's a good movie
i really enjoy the house of elliot the series starts off well with two sisters going into the business and opening up their own successful shop season 2 ditches some of the old villains the scheming relatives and introduces a french designer and a banker as the of the season again as with the first series i like the character bea a bit more than i like evie evie 's antics do n't really excite me that much she seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two i also do n't find myself enraptured by the romance while i enjoy both characters individually i see bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife also i do n't really care that much about the film industry so watching jack 'on the job ' does n't hold that much appeal still this was a solid season and its nice to see the sisters be successful for once
any word on series 4 of the house of eliott will be released on dvd i too found the last episode of series 3 to be quite a and i would surely be looking forward to seeing what happens to jack in parliament as well as how evie will fight for her couturier part in the design house any word would be appreciated
i thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 2 and 3 of the house of eliott the acting was fantastic the dresses magnificent and the locations as with most english marvelous my only complaint is that it does n't end ! ! there is no closure to this as you approach the last chapter of season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left and oh surprise ! things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone ! is there any chance that there is a season 4 out there somewhere
i greatly enjoyed both series 1 and 2. the costumes are spectular the plot can be a little tedious at times but there is an impressive cast of different characters coming and going throughout the series it 's also pleasantly predictable so a lot of fun my only complaint is that the last episode is a mild cliff hanger and later episodes are n't available my compliments to for carrying these reviews it was the only place i found that indicated that there are more episodes to come on dvd not even the website provided that information ! thanks amazon and volunteer reviewers
i rediscovered this after a long time this is a great had never seen this in its entirety and look forward to seeing the third and fourth which i understand is not out a gem love the storyline and so authentic looking and of the period even the wish there were more of this genre
wonderful series hope they bring out the third one soon loved i
hilarious from beginning to end ! pearl er eugene levy will you marry me
yes it is that funny the humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of rob reiner 's this is spinal tap in which christopher guest costarred and predecessor to guest 's later masterpieces best in show and a mighty wind reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary guest has in three films now masterfully emulated reiner 's style assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three unless one prefers slapstick this is comedy just about as funny as it comes the first time i saw it i do n't think i really caught on until the scene where blaine missouri 's the film was actually filmed in texas town historian recounted how blaine was founded after wagon train leader blaine fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in california near the pacific when in fact they were in missouri the plot is rather simple in honor of the anniversary of blaine 's inadvertent founding a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue corky clair an obviously gay theater person who has fled new york for the small town takes on the challenge of directing the bulk of the movie consists of auditions rehearsals and the final performance of the musical the title stems from the hope that a guffman of a new york theatrical company will be in attendance this film was literally made up as they went along my understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which guest had to craft a final film while move films are refined in the editing phase this one is unique for being created at that stage because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll a film like this takes a special cast of actors veterans of improv like catherine o'hara and eugene levy and stand ups such as fred willard are to be expected but what is so great is how people you would n't automatically think would excel in the form such as the always delightful parker posey do so by way of trivia the part of the play 's narrator is played by lewis arquette son of cliff arquette and father of all those other arquettes including rosanna patricia and david and i 'm sure all arrested development fans will love the ufo expert played by none other than tobias himself david cross famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show one of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a three months later '' coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up corky is back in new york hoping for tryouts perhaps as henry higgins in a revival of my fair lady the joke comes when we find out he is running a hollywood memorabilia store where one of the hottest items is a my dinner with andre action figure set for those who have n't seen the film the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is wallace and andre talk while seated in a restaurant i 've learned the hard way that this and guest 's other films are n't for everybody not everyone seems to get '' them this astonishes me since i find these films funnier than anything else coming out of hollywood these days but for whatever reason so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them but for those who are these films are priceless gems
this is a really great and hilarious movie if you 're a christopher guest fan and you like spinal tap '' and a mighty wind '' you 'll love this one as well it 's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies like fred willard and catherine o'hara and they 're all always great together also david cross is hilarious as the ufo nut definitely buy this movie and do n't forget to pick up a remains of the day '' lunchbox while you 're at it
if you have ever been involved in any sort of community or college theater you have got to see this film there is great truth in this fiction
waiting for guffman is an awesomely funny movie ! it 's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot awkward transitions bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action the characters are wonderful guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the blaine community players the movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty thoughtful humor as well what 's great about this movie as well is that you 're not just laughing at the characters you 're getting excited about the blaine sesquecentennial right along with them ! the songs are catchy in a frighteningly annoying kind of way and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review if you have seen other guest movies i would say this one ranks in the middle for me best in show is my favorite waiting for guffman then a mighty wind i think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of pride and revelry loved it ! favorite line i hate you you bastard people you 're all bastard people !
this movie is just plain hilarious if you have ever known people who fancy themselves members of the creative elite buy this dvd the endless laughs will make up for all the suffering pretentious types have ever put you through that 's a bargain at any price
having known a few people who fancy themselves as creative types it was a fun experience to watch this one could argue that this misguided feeling that people have is one of the main concerns of christopher guest it may be a limited view of people but it is also a predominant problem for most of us i would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful i do n't mind that so much for me the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people this film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little you will see the psychological game playing going on it is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics or amateur anything you will notice that mr guest has made a number of other films like this and they are all entertaining i encourage you to see them all for the characters the rich tapestry of humanity we all deal with every day
i think that for a first time vanessa did a great job the story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in which is very similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well it 's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine this family is real and i know them all because they are my family as well others say this family is impossible to exist but they do slightly less dramatic but its all there i think it 's great
this is how that greek wedding '' movie should have been done ! its sweet without being schmaltzie its gritty without losing heart i like to think of this film as that other wedding film '' on ecstasy in a very flattering way it was written produced directed and starred the very talented vanessa parise keep your eye on this young woman folks she is going places
sibling rivalry an overbearing father great italian food small town versus big city life family bonds life choices handsome men four beautiful sisters so much to relate to emotional fun and definitely worth buying
i laughed i cried so entertaining loved it we need more movies like this one i want to see it on the big screen
i thought this was a chick flick but i actually really liked it
i 'm usually not into reality tv shows never watched one for more than one episode however when i started watching the apprentice i immediately became addicted to it it is by far the best reality show ever created not only its entertaining but most importantly its educational it gives the viewers a chance to see and experience secondhand many aspects of many types of businesses and how people from different backgrounds work together or not also trump shares so much of his knowledge in doing business that just those insights are enough reason to buy this dvd highly recommended !
i bought this product for a business training program many of our associates where not aware of the winner and what his business message offers this product was great as a learning tool with an added bonus of no commercials ''
the apprentice season 5 is being shown on hong kong tv each monday and i ca n't believe both my son and i have arranged our social schedules around this tv show on monday evening we are absolutely hooked on it and can hardly wait for the next episode why does it take so long for season and 4 to come out in dvd this is an ideal gift for anyone with good taste for a good tv serial
'the apprentice ' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television slickly but sharply presented it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that ca n't fail to enthrall a nyse broker or an unfamiliar novice the elements are assembled expertly by 'survivor ' creator mark burnett and the donald editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama alumni bill rancic in his autobiographical business memoir called 'the apprentice ' a game show deference should be showed for his evaluation but they could have fooled us it seems more like a simulation season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons the task taskmaster and the takers mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants an assignment with a different business aspect provided and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared what will they have to do how will they get their act together who will get fired then in the middle of the episode the donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principal usually highlighting a contestant 's later actions it could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson but his folksy lecture becomes an illuminating intermission season one works well for the cast of characters and as contestants there are plenty here ! the first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity it worked because the first group had less talent and accumen and more heart and colorful personalities overall there was a savvy charismatic businesswoman from texas amy a colorful cowboy from boise troy a brash but spunky new yorker heidi a smooth and learned broker kwame and a calm and entrepreneur from chicago bill just to name a few the serial drama seems genuine and not forced the premise contained risks that could have been a disaster the plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken but more interesting was the love interest of amy and nick both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics furthermore a villain was added to the mix omarossa forgive me for the misspelling ! formerly worked for the clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything she was n't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with donald trump on 'the apprentice ' website she wrote that never was so much good come from being so bad it turns out that she 's had the most stories an aspiring actress she 's been successful for halle berry 's 'catwoman ' and a upn soap opera maybe she was grooming to be the next erica lucci all along in a recent book trump himself called her the most articulate '' of all the first year contestants i thought the same but have to give him the credit not to spoil discoveries with details but nick 's honesty and chauvenism amy 's perfectionism and heidi 's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest seldom have people on a reality show been more endearing than with this ensemble upon the debut we all became armchair quarterbacks calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out the donald for some executive decisions when he fired omarossa i thought he did it at the worst time when she was at her finest form and the only one on her team to produce however results are everything he did n't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment ! to rephrase 'snl ' he 's the donald and you 're not ! '' and that 's where the success falls apart sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'apprentice ' website commentary to paraphrase a good strategy and engaging television can often come at true to himself after season one donald trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes the result was a feeding frenzy later seasons fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera the professionals devoured the latter stacy for instance was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant cheerleading sensibilities if the catclaws were apparent season one they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men ! season two was bloody after season one the tasks were bigger but did n't showcase specific designated skills like negotiating for each week with each new task the later simulations often failed to surprise later it was harder to like the candidates trump 's admirable genuineness created but later killed the show
i live in thailand i dont get any american tv programs here so i watch a lot of tv shows on dvd i either get from friends or buy as for this review the apprentice is a great reality show i have watched it over and over again my only comment is when will the rest of the apprentice seasons come out on dvd for purshase it is a shame thier is only the season out for sale please send me an if any future seasons of the apperentice do become availible on dvd thank you thomas lentin
i had a great time watching the first season via this dvd set i have seen the last two seasons and loved them but i had never seen the first season i thought i 'd get this to see how it was and i wanted to see how the first winner was while being a candidate i have to say that it was amazing i loved the whole series the candidates were very unique and entertaining to watch even trump is a little more laid back in this season than others the bonus disk is also very fun it has more info on the candidates a music video deleted scenes career advice from trump 's advisors george and carolyn an exclusive sneak peak of season 2 '' unseen footage from the ending title taxi rides new interviews with donald trump and the contestants and creator mark burnett on the apprentice a lot to offer really i really recommend this set to those who like reality shows like survivor even if you have n't seen the first season or even if you have n't seen any of the seasons this is really a great set i hope to see the second season on dvd soon
i 've had a lot of experience as a 'project manager ' and it does n't quite resemble the show 's job description first and foremost this is a tv show where none of the women are overweight and are above average looking the men are allowed to be average looking season one is by far the best after that the show has just repeated itself and has not shown enough creative projects to keep it compelling the personalities are the stars omorosa is not a capable worker but manages to inflate her abilities no wonder she could n't keep a government job my sister saw the season finale with me but did n't see the other episodes she asked what was wrong with that woman so true there 's no way omorosa should have a position with responsibility lucily amy is intelligent enough to keep the show from filling it with so so business women who are of course attractive kwame and bill could have easily won and would have done well at the job they did n't attack each others personalities but tried to play up their strengths after the season it became the 'street vendor show ' and then the 'create a marketing campaign for a large company ' by the second season many candidates were fired for the wrong reasons the season had more logic behind the firings
i did n't start watching the apprentice until the second season now i am a big fan of the show and i look forward to each new season i bought the season one dvd set awhile ago and love it ! i just wish that they would now release the rest of the seasons ! trump gives great tips that are highlighted during different times in the shows and i always look forward to what he will say next as successful as he is he 's definitely worth listening to ! you might think that a reality show like this would get boring over time but this one still manages to keep us watching and loving it ! not only is the apprentice entertaining but you can learn a lot from the show
i bought this dvd and it was the best ! the only thing i do n't like is they are playing for a job
i never watched the apprentice when it was on tv i thought i would n't like it because i am not into business or donald trump but i checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about and i was hooked ! i watched it all weekend one episode after the other i had to know what happened ! i loved the challenges given to the contestants it was fun to see how they would work through them plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama great show
frank oz directs the best steve martin movies while michael caine is a reliably excellent presence in most if not all of the movies he appears in martin in my opinion is uneven and all too often relies on shtick oz seems to bring out the best or makes best use of the worse in martin 's bag of tricks bowfinger is further evidence of this we 've husband wife and three kids have seen this movie too many times to count and yet quite a few scenes never fail to make us laugh the scene of caine posing as famed medical specialist testing martin 's feigned psychosomatic paralysis is priceless
this one has it all an inspired script lady fanny of omaha based on a clever premise an opportunity for steve martin to work a full range of schticks including a very earnest do n't pity me you do n't have to do that '' ruse a riviera backdrop and a stylish jazz violin score by the late miles goodman of special note is michael caine 's wonderful a role that would have been pun intended for the late david niven and executed to perfection by caine who is at the top of his form here caine and martin playing with one another is great fun and oh yes there 's that segment about ruprecht that a friend and i have bantered about for years entertainment
so many hysterical scenes that make everyone i watch it with laugh the ending is one that i can only aspire too and i ca n't give it away ! however i will say that watching con artists con eachother is on par with watching josh holloway trying to portray sawyer '' his through the tv series lost enjoy
this movie will make you laugh from beginning to end ! i have watched it several times and still laugh out loud highly recommeded for fans of michael cane and steve martin
dirty rotten scoundrels '' is a classic comedy driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by michael caine and steve martin the storyline has been addressed extensively by other reviewers but i will add that this film definitely breaks mom 's old rule do n't make fun of the handicapped '' not only are martin and caine 's characters both morally handicapped in the extreme but martin gets to play not one but two handicapped characters as he works his cons one is in a wheelchair and the other ruprecht i do n't know exactly what ruprecht 's handicap is but i can understand why he 's kept locked up in his room finally this movie has a lovely look to it allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the french riviera stay in the finest hotels and villas and sip the best champagne that 's a step up from most movies these days right there no explosions or violence amazing
for me this film works because of michael caine it is his style and strong characterization as lawrence jamieson that holds the film together and allows steve martin to riff with his role as the crass freddie benson the film takes some chances and not everything works and some of it seems as if it belongs in another film but part of the key to this film is to distract you so you do n't really suspect what is happening until the end glenne headly is very nice as janet colgate the object of a bet between the over confident con men lawrence and freddie are so sure of themselves that the loser is willing to leave town because each believes the other one is the loser however caine 's character jamieson begins to have pangs about treating such an innocent so callously freddie steve martin 's more crass con man has his own misgivings as well there are several really well done supporting roles but the movie is really about these three and how caine and martin begin working together and end up competing one of the finest bits in the movie is when caine is trying to teach martin the social graces of a gentleman con man frank oz did a good job with this movie some might say that he let too much of martin 's shtick into the movie but i think it serves its important purpose of misdirection and much as jim carrey today martin was quite hot then and audiences had certain expectations for him and the bits are funny in a way that also induces a bit of queasiness but funny nonetheless watching the movie nowadays while i still enjoy martin 's performance i really enjoy caine 's more and notice headly a bit more than i did the first time through
this is outright hilarious i admit i have n't seen the original version but this one is fantastic it 's choc full of witty and intelligent humour and it 's well acted too back in the day when i first saw this i did n't see the ending coming who would have guessed without giving anything away in a nutshell steve martin and michael caine compete to see who can swindle a set amount of dollars off a particular lady first it 's a riot watching these two act out bizzare plots just to win the cash you must see this you will be in stitches
laurence jameson caine is a hustling rich corupt women out of thousands by lies and decept freddy benson is also a hustling your average everyday woman out of a meal or two here and there but when the two of them end up in the same place at the same time they realize they have competition and when freddy realizes how much laurence really makes off these women well he wants just as much the two decide to work together resulting in one of the funniest chain of events in movie history whether martin is playing ruprecht the monkey boy or officer benson the man crippled by memories of his fiance dancing naked with the host of dance america martin is absolutly histarical caine has a dry humor that works well when bouced off of martins charisma i 'm not a caine fan but here he works well and casting can be forgiven since the script is tight and yes martin is brilliant highly recomended this will make you laugh out loud and ruprecht will make you laugh so hard you will cry
laurence jamieson michael caine is a sophisticated confidence man that has be praying on the riviera so long that he is even in the good graces of the local law enforcement he crosses paths with an other dirty rotten scoundrel '' fred benson steve martin who is more on the nickel and dime level after a fails attempt to shake fred off laurence decides to shape him up thy have to compete against the unknown predator only known as the jackal can fred learn the finer points of relieving people of their monetary endowment or will everyone fall prey to the jackal they could not have picked better people for the parts as the actors seem to have put a lot of their own personalities into the roles
great movie it is a must to have in your dvd collection some scenes in the movie are hillarious you laugh until you have tears in your eyes an interesting comparison of the american and european culture the twist at the end incredible do not miss this movie
this movie is a must have for all family libraries it appeals to adults and youth alike a true movie about how we are all the same inside no matter what our outward differences are really teaches the lesson do n't judge a book by its cover ''
i bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me i enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also times and styles may have changed but i believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did simple but great movie my only regret is that it was n't close captioned
i dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980 's or have gone to school in the united states but i can still relate to this movie this movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story only fashion and accessories would be different everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie i would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now it may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie it gains momentum as it moves along and by the end after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied being a small cast all your attention is focused on the individual characters the 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant each actor plays their part perfectly while there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons they will all probably be most remembered for this movie with the exception of emilio estevez but special mention must go to judd nelson who i believe is the biggest star of the film his part was originally intended for either nicholas cage or john cusack who would have also been great but i 'm glad judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities it is a shame the dvd lacks many special features all you get is a trailer and cast bios i was desperately seeking an audio commentary or at the very least production notes however there are some interesting facts noted on imdb a teen movie for the 80 's generation anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic
this movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different this is a comming of age film for the 1980 's the acting is wonderful it is a different style of movie there were some really great movies comming out then ferris beulers day off pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful this is another one it is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time the 1980 's is a time i was fond of i do not find it tacky as the media is right now this movie is funny some of these classics get refered to in other movies you might want to watch it
the breakfast club one of the best movies out there timless no matter what 's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie !

the crow collector 's series boxed set consists of the first three of four in the series although all three have the same theme each is quite different and exciting
the trio of the crow films yes i enjoyed the crow city of angels much as i enjoyed the first and the third are unique by their own right using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them the first black and white homage to the graphic novels with little pints of color the second colors but somewhat interesting as it shows us an type of a city much needing an angel guarding it and the third movie to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad in each tale the crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love in the second its the one true pure soul left in the city sarah and villains brandon lee 's performance will become if not already legendary and i refer to his dvd interview to emphasis its greatness because we do not know when we will die we think of life as an inexhaustable well '' will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it these three are classics not to be confused with the fourth which has less impact since it tries too hard to be original yet looses something along the way in terms of casting acting and cinematography as the atmosphere has n't worked that well should have used more of that grittier '' feel to the scenes like the four horsemen 's introduction scenes if you ask me having read poppy brite 's the crow the lazarus heart '' i found it more suitable for an adaptation and thinking of it as taking the crow in more nastier ways than ever before but by using the first three films success in doing a sequels it will take a miracle for these movies from becoming a
this is love the crow movies especially the first one it rocks this box set rocks the ppl who created it rock too
the first with brandon lee is a blast as always i am not sure why everyone is so upset over the second one after all eric and shelly are refured to by sarah the second movie contiues with sarah 's story i dont know why but most people miss that the third well i just got my set and have not gotten to it yet but i expect it to be just as good
the first film is fantastic and so are the feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it 's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies i personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these their good or honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about if it 's just a last but not least the remarkable thing i like about this series so much is when a important person dies that they can be given a chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightful deed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or believe it 's a act of
the second and third films are basically garbage if the crow directed by proyas is the standard then the rest are so far separated that they fall into oblivion the tale as played by brandon lee works on just so many levels and is in my view one of the best films about justice for victims i have a number of versions of the crow on vhs and dvd and the extras on the triple pack fail in one respect there is an interview with lee on the vhs version that is without a doubt one of the most poignant touching and eerily prescient interviews on tape lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless and yet how many times will we see the moonrise how many times will the things we love happen in other words the moments we have are precious it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant and just the loss the loss or at least the change of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the dvd however the triple pack is well worth it if only to get the brilliant film and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original the crow and the sequels should never have been made lee 's legacy should have been left as it was lee is truly masterful in this film milking the franchise destroys brandons legacy
i splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday devil 's night i wanted to have all three films available should i feel the need to watch them again the concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to it seems to be the only kind that really exists i was n't dissappointed in this set it contains all three of the collectors series '' versions which means that they are packed full of special features the profile of james o ' barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good plus there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films i really ca n't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films i mean the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different crows and different injustices to be righted sure the original film is by far the best almost supernaturally superior but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision
the the first and obviously the best edition of the crow many people say there was no other person destinied to play the role of eric draven better than brandon action excitement and sadness any dark movie could ask alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of give it stars the crow city of it always makes me mad about hearing everyone dislike this movie because it didnt live up to the hype of the original got a whole different plot to glad they didnt have each movie based around the same plot that would pretty much make anyothers after the original seem rather one thought it had a lot of good things in it show that there 's different types of love and not just for the whole i give it stars the crow in my opinion a really good movie in its own mean it had alot of different things that the others were lacking like mystery we didnt know til near the very end of the movie exactly who was behide the great acting by jodi lyne o'keefe among others like kirsten dunst and eric poor man being framed for the murder of his own girlfriend his own death wasnt in vain because he came back from the dead to find the real give it stars like i said each movie had things about them that made them different and very well producted in their own 'd say to any movie buff these 3 you 'd get your money 's worth stars for the box se
i found this film very entertaining ! i loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters it 's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors ' voices in animated character form but besides the fun i feel this film had some good underlying lessons too when we 'overindulge ' we often cause ourselves trouble one overindulgent racoon gets himself and his friends into a pickle by being greedy and will they be able to fix his mess and more important will they forgive him chrissy mcvay autho
the story drags a bit in the beginning but by the end my wife and i ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit the voice acting was great all around especially shatner as a possum prone to playing possum and the cgi animation is fine much of the movie seemed very familar especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the 300 episode of futurama but like they say if you 're going to steal steal from the best ben folds music is another highpoint stick around for his kid friendly rendition of rockin ' the suburbs the extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines an additional cartoon featuring the original cast and a sneak preview of jerry seinfeld 's bee movie all in all i recommend this to fans of animation
considering i just saw cars i was n't so sure about over the hedge i mean cars actually became one of my favorites after i finished it ! but i gave this a shot and i 'm glad i did i 'll admit the whole concept of using the others to repay a debt was n't very original but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable now i 'm debating whether or not i want to buy it i 'd say rent it first but if you have kids this is a good one for your collection
this is done by my friend over the hedge is a very cute movie and one that the hole family can watch it will have you laughing the hole time it is hilarious and the animation is excellant and you 'll be wanting to watch it again i would deffanitly buy it ! it was awesome
yeah yeah yeah it was intended to kids but the movie is so well made that like yours truly will thoroughly enjoy it the movie has thought provoking satire of modern lifestyle suvs pizza delivery urban sprawl strip malls and the like that grown ups can immediately relate to a bonus feature on the dvd shows what technology and blend of art physics computing and psychology a film of this caliber takes if you are outside the intended age group for this movie read kids and have no kids i just gave you a perfect excuse to justify this dvd ! overall highly recommended
for what you get in this dvd the amazon price current at the time of my writing is fabulous value the story runs the full range of emotions and will touch the heart of kids and adults with good hearts with the fun joy and total adventure ride that the film encompasses i am sure that everyone will support different characters and hammy with his caffeine power is just a wow of a performance they certainly did right by the consumer on this product
the raccoon bruce willis was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend 's nick nolte cave and accidently destroys his food he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies he finds a family of animals gary shandling william shatner wanda sykes steve carrell eugene levy catherine o'hara avril lavigne and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans later on the gladys allison janey hires professional exterminator dwayne thomas hayden church to kill them but can rj save his own life or his new friends 's extremely entertaining and fantastic cgi animated comedy from the makers of shrek 1 2 '' antz '' and madagscar '' dreamworks provides great realistic cgi and laughs for everybody there 's also heart in this movie and shows the meaning of what it is like to have friends and be one 's true self instead of being selfish ! steve carrell 's character hammy the squirrel steals the show here as the best character in the movie it 's a wonderful and hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults this dvd has some good extras like two sneek previews to shrek 3 '' and '' audio commentary featurette vernetech commercial games meet the cast featurette and gallery highly recommended ! the best dreamworks animated movie since shrek 1 2 ''
i have loved the comic series and i definitely loved the movie rj vern and hammy especially will forever be my favorite urban forest critters the forest critters meets suburbia is so smart and as funy as the comic it was based on
this is the best of the animated films that flooded the box office this summer great voice talent great storyline and a highly enjoyable time at the movies the story pokes fun at our society and our excesses when a family of animals invade suburbia dreamworks is giving pixar a run for their money
it was a great exercise video but my daughter and i had a little bit of a hard time keeping up with some of the moves but overall it was a great workou
great video easy to follow dances are clean and fun to do
this is the first of two hardy boys serials that originally appeared in the mickey mouse club '' you will not get the mickey mouse club '' on this dvd just the hardy boys segments in the mid 1990 's the disney channel cable tv removed some of the mmc serials from the shows and created new shows of just those stories new opening closing titles were created for these new the song gold doubloons pieces of eight '' introduces you to the mystery of applegate 's treasure '' a serialized story loosely based on the first hardy boys book the tower treasure '' starring tim considine of spin marty fame as frank hardy tommy kirk old yeller the shaggy dog as joe hardy purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete unedited mickey mouse club '' shows that these ran in but fans will still enjoy these episodes
i saw this cinematic masterpiece with my french class and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of french teenaged despair we felt close to vic as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on mattieu vic 's parents seemed similar to my french class ' parents and so did vic 's school with its social hierarchy and innocent parties i feel that la boum '' truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between american teenagers and their french peers this effort is successful in my opinion as our class found that we were laughing with vic crying with her and screaming with her at her frustrating parents we lived through la boum '' in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl and found that we were n't that much different after all la boum '' made an impact on us more than goodburger '' or totoro '' ever could
for those who grew up watching the american pie '' movies the la boum '' films must seem silly harmless and bland if you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes do n't bother with this movie if you want some harmless family fun and some conversational french practice rent or buy la boum ''
i watched both parts of la boum '' for the first time when i was about 12 years old you can imagine how surprised i was when i found this movie on this website this movie will definitely be appreciated by those who like french language french cinematography and sophie morceau it 's a great listening practice i do n't want to go into details if you want to know what it 's about watch it it was made in and it makes it even more interesting
it is nice to see sarah michelle geller in a role here i 'm so used to seeing her as buffy ''
cruel intentions has been slammed by critics who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989 's dangerous liaisons both films stem from choderlos de laclos 's novel les liaisons dangereuses whereas dangerous liaisons is fairly faithful to the original cruel intentions manipulates the plot throwing a twist in the tail and relocates the milieu from century france to the upper east side of new york where underneath the veneer of respectability wealthy teenagers plot each other 's downfalls stepsiblings kathryn merteuil and sebastian valmont are two such teenagers they amuse themselves by arranging paybacks for those who have wronged them and make wagers on the outcome the focus of the movie is sebastian 's attempt to make a conquest of the headmaster 's virginal daughter annette who in a attempt at symbolism wears white throughout almost the entire film however the movie certainly has some memorable high points beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise with some discomfort that the park is in fact a graveyard the opening scenes also introduce the appealing and soundtrack which includes artists as diverse as placebo and fatboy slim the verve 's song bittersweet symphony is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts ' track at the film 's conclusion these kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers in the end though perhaps we just like to see someone be very very wicked and almost get away with it
this movie was so amazing and i was extremely attracted to the theme the story involves alot of seduction and betrayal i call that the perfect mix for a teen movie i am a teenager myself and i found it to be quite interesting the cast was great and i think that made the movie even better it was a movie involvong every type of character the good girl the evil whore and to top it off one guy for both girls i would reccomend seeing it but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes i hope you see it and enjoy
this modern day addaptation of dangerous liasons took us to another level with the heartless calculated antics of teenagers while this was panned by critics it spoke to something in the audience in it 's sociopathic tendencies sarah michelle geller plays kathryn the student body president of an elitist new york boarding school and step sister of ryan phillipe the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser she makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed reese witherspoon who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage should he succeed he can have kathryn if he fails kathryn can have his car perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what i mean ryan phillipe is every girl 's dream come true and worst nightmare while he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can he will post nude photos of them on the internet and pat himself on the back as a stud give him a challenge such as reese witherspoon and he has to work hard for it while he is truly a cad he does in the end feel love for reese because he had to work for her affections kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom that 's what it 's all about as the viewer you ca n't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes how about that scene when kathryn says she puts her trust in jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon that 's classic if anything it teaches you to not fall for others ' fronts so girls be careful of who seems so sincere and boys do n't be so cruel
what more can you want you have 5 of the hottest hollywood stars and you get a sexy and also funny yor hands on this movie and the cruel sarah michelle geller is facinating to the end is such a tearjerker
in the late 1990 's something happened two movies came out neither was particularly well reviewed although a few respected critics did give them good reviews but despite all the negativity the two films became cult hits and are still referenced to today in movies all the time these two movies were '' wild things '' and cruel intentions '' while wild things '' featured an elaborate plot cast great sex scenes cruel intentions '' plot is simple has a cast of then and has no nudity at all both of these movies scored with the mtv crowd and while you can find both films in the 5 dollar bin at everyone remembers them also both of these movies are just mindless fun you 're attention span does n't have to be large and the people involved in both movies were n't trying to make classic films that would win oscars and great acclaim which in the long run attracted many critics and audiences to these movies while i think wild things is a better movie this film did keep me entertained for 94 minutes anyway ryan phillippe plays sebastian valmont sebastian is a spoiled rich kid who happens to be incredibly charming and takes pleasure in having sex with young women and destroying their lives everyone knows what sebastian is like and he loves it his kathryn is pretty much the same except she basks in the role of the '' she 's even student body president of the school they attend one day kathryn tells sebastian how a guy named court has dumped her and fallen for a young idiot girl named cecile selma blair and she wants sebastian 's help to destroy the young girl 's life sebastian has found something a bit more interesting the new headmaster 's daughter annette reese witherspoon annette is a virgin who plans to stay that way and sebastian sees a challenge so kathryn proposes a wager if sebastian succeeds in deflowering annette he will get the thing he 's been longing for for years he 'll get to bed kathryn if he loses kathryn gets his most prized possession his car pit of a perverted plot yes and it comes together in funny sometimes even stupid ways but as i said earlier for mindless entertainment it 's dead on as for the performances gellar is great as the sadistic little nice girl with phillippe however i could n't tell if his acting was bad or if that 's how sebastian would act blair captures the innocent unwitting virgin girl quality perfectly she 's so good in fact she almost seems to be a virgin witherspoon obviously since she 's the only person in this film to go and win anything in really the strongpoint of the film at this point in her career she really had the cute innocent girl face and qualities and there 's a few scenes in the movie where the face '' thing i mentioned is clearly there but she 's playing a different virgin girl from blair witherspoon is playing the knowing smart want to wait for love girl so this movie is really not for everybody as you may have figured out by now but if you 're at the video store and just need 90 minutes of entertainment and fun go for it grade b
i 'm glad this is finally available on dvd i 've just about worn out my old vhs version of it on this dvd you get an introduction by kathy followed by a routine this is composed of some light aerobics and stretching then you get five different ab workouts one for each day of the week they each last about 10 12 minutes i never actually timed them but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last each workout consists of approximately five different exercises though there may be two or three variations on an exercise so there 's quite a bit of variety areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques the muscles along the sides of the abs the monday workout is fairly easy and should n't present a problem for any but the most individuals tuesday 's workout is only slightly harder by the time you get to wednesday and thursday they start getting rather challenging to get through these you 'll need to be in fairly descent shape friday is the really difficult one i 'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it of course you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you then join back in it took me about six weeks before i was able to complete the friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks i like to use this video as a before my weight lifting workout kathy does the workout along with 5 other people the music is unobtrusive type stuff with a little funk edge to it you 'll need a bench or chair and some dumbells only used on two exercises you could use some other object if you do n't have dumbells i 'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape you 'll definitely get a from doing these workouts provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs
this movie is hilarious and it also delivers powerful truths about the workplace my favorite scene is doralee 's dolly parton 's character 's fantasy about killing the rotten boss this is dolly 's first movie and she is a natural everyone in this film does a superb job made in 1980 but timeless
jane fonda is best taken on screen in small doses and the presence of the ace funny girl lily tomlin and the inside dolly parton in supporting roles help this project immensely my favorite actor in this one however is dabney coleman as the evil boss there are a few excesses including a marijuana scene which rings false for this trio of but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours
lilly tomlin is hysterical in this movie she makes this movie it ' fun and your rooting for the women all the way one specific part is not for the kids my kids were bored with it but i enjoyed it from the release date and it 's still entertaining
i love 9 to 5. it is truly a classic the pairing of jane fonda lilly tomlin and dolly parton is genius this movie keeps me laughing the whole time
the film has aged it 's still just as funny all these years is a must for anyone who has ever had thoughts of getting revenge on a documentary afterwards is great as it offers a lookat how the three girls ended up filming it even after 25 years
a great movie ! lily tomlin dolly parton and jane fonda are wonderful ! i 'm so glad this movie is in my dvd library ! the laughter will be side splitting ! they really give dabney coleman a run for his money ! a must have dvd for any collection
first thoughts this movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence 9 to 5 '' reaches and touches everybody both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying though the plot is great and really moves it is the smart '' ideas dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience we need to salute colin higgins first higgins was the screenwriter for harold and maude '' silver streak '' and foul play '' picking up a golden globe nomination for foul play '' in 1978. all of higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious cliches that many of his films ' topics ' encompass also editor pembroke herring who was nominated for 3 academy awards for editing and also edited ground hogs day '' did an amazingly seamless job of keeping 9 to 5 '' so coherently glued together herring was nominated for best editing '' for tora ! tora ! tora ! 1970 bound for glory '' out of africa '' 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas higgins and herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and 9 to 5 '' is one of them the three female leads all embody some type of stereotype lily tomlin as violet newstead is the widow with four children going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years unsuccessfully she is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man 's world so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through hart dabney coleman jane fonda as judy bernly is in the middle of a divorce in which her husband dick played deftly by lawrence pressman left her for his secretary judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself dolly parton as the delightful doralee rhodes who chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time his examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples ' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself that 's of course and he is the bane of these three innocent women '' and as we see represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it btw dolly parton in this role was nominated for an oscar '' best song '' and 3 golden globes '' includeing best actress in a musical or comedy '' this film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training dabney coleman as franklin hart or just delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office he is his '' 3 girls '' reason for being the way they are at least throughout the film coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role carrol o'connor did in all in the family '' as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed comedy and cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and 9 to 5 '' serves that cause well chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of coleman 's character man or woman we all enjoy coleman 's comeupance and so will you my favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana naturally these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against even such animated disney characters as snow white '' make an appearance in tomlin 's depiction of hart 's demise naturally the reality nearly repeats tomlin 's fantasy on the very next day which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse evading the police kidnapping and much much more the scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon we are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film 's plot have been resolved this is a terrific black comedy our characters 3 female leads gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction their foil after showing all how despicable he was literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds reel justice '' tidy and quick ! ! the topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated the cast colin higgins director screenwriter jane fonda judy bernly lily tomlin violet newstead dolly parton doralee rhodes dabney coleman franklin hart sterling hayden tinsworthy elizabeth wilson roz henry jones hinkle lawrence pressman dick marian mercer missy hart the awards best song nom dolly parton 1980 academy best musical or comedy nom dolly parton 1980 golden globe best original song nom dolly parton 1980 golden globe new star of the year female nom dolly parton 1980 golden globe dvd features it is widescreen and much clearer than the vhs release the disney characters in violet 's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release it has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same dvd in either english or french with english or spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all of course naturally some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases final thoughts this wonderful film is highly recommended and 9 to '' entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years

9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling it takes a look at the workplace from a woman 's view we first meet violet lily tomlin who has been working for consolidated companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them she trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it judy jane fonda is the new girl in the office she is a divorcee he left her for his secretary and has never worked for a living rounding out the heroines is doralee dolly parton in the film debut she is the personal secretary of franklin hart dabney coleman and everyone thinks she is banging the boss '' but the fun starts when violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train she then blurts out that hart has been spreading rumors that he 's been having an affair with doralee and an employee is fired for a small infraction this sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss judy is a big game hunter with hart as the prey doralee plays role reversal and hart ends up on a rotisserie spit but violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is snow white and the wicked witch and poisons hart the next day violet accidentally poisons hart 's coffee when falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious violet thinks she killed him this leads to an all out comedy chase with violet steals the wrong corpse the next day to the ladies surprise hart shows up the ladies regroup in the restroom but roz overhears them and reports it to hart hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence the find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in hart 's absence hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and hart is not above taking someone else 's glory the subject matter here is very serious so to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly this is a film that many people identify with everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them and this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors you will laugh until it hurts dvd extras commentary by producer bruce gilbert and stars lily jane and dolly 9 to 5 25 a 25 minute featurette with interviews with gilbert writer director colin higgins and stars lily jane dolly and dabney coleman deleted scenes 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes the problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut
however did anyone else notice how 25 years later dabney coleman is referring to tomlin fonda and parton as gals '' and girls '' in the 9 to 5 at 25 featurette made me wonder
this movie may be unfamiliar to american viewers who watch american movies only but this is a very humorous movie starring some of russia 's best comedians yuri nikulin and andrei mironov in bulgaria they used to show it on every new year 's day the plot is like this a russian turist nikulin in istanbul slips and falls and says chort poberi '' which means something like damn '' or hell '' or go to the devil '' in russian language this happens to be a password for some bandits who await their man mironov to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his broken arm without realizing what is happening nikulin 's character smuggles the diamonds then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits and there is a happy end watch this film i 'm sure you will enjoy it in bulgaria you can legally buy it on a dvd for just 2
an hilarious movie about mistaken identity the russian mafia the kgb and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all ! nikulin is hilarious as usual and what can you say about the peerless mironov i watched this movie back in some 14 years ago and even when my russian was just in the basic stage i could still follow it once my russian progressed i grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour if you like enjoying yourself buy this movie
i have read one negative review about this film and i would like to clarify the statements made in it i am russian so obviously i like this film it has typical russian humor it is a farce so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes it makes fun of the social standards of the soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well it features some of the best russian actors that we love seeing and acting they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well if you are a tough judge of movies then please make sure you know soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in american movies before you call it crap i do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie in fact it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie and as for cyrillic letters not making sense this is a russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet besides the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country it was shot in baku azerbajan but is supposed to be turkey the language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish it was made up specially for the movie that said i want to say a few words about the plot semen semenovich is a diligent russian economist goes on a cruise where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob 's right hand kozodoev whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to moscow via a cast on his arm during one of the last stops semen semenovich gets mistaken for kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it as he returns to moscow semen contacts the police now he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia as i already said the movie is fantastic just remember that it is a farce and no there is not slapstick humour be and enjoy ! oh and by the way all the jewelry you will see on the screen is authentic it 's mentioned in the beginning that the film crew would like to thank all soviet individuals who lend their gems for the filming
this movie is the greatest classic comedy ever do n't listen to the lady who gave this movie only 2 stars she does n't know what she is talking about only person with the limited sence of humor may not like this film believe me it 's ! ! ! !
this movie is one of those films that never grow old it 's been the total hit for more than 30 years sparkling humour wo n't let you be bored the acting is great ! phrases from the movie are now popular aphorisms ! the movie arises in you the warmest feelings ! enjoy this movie
this is a typical semi slapstick gaiday film it is corny well produced and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy the subtitles are just fine you do not have to understand any russian to laugh at this movie buy it and enjoy
this film was dope a must see for anyone who is curious about culture or for those that need to know the history a very informative documentary an essential in any collection
wow ! this brought back so many memories for me i was shocked when a friend of mine gave me this dvd as a christmas present because i 'm the ultimate head and to my surprise and his i 'm in it ! as the dvd plays there are seemingly a hundred still shots of jams '' and crew pictures '' being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time if you were there you may spot some of your peeps this is one of the most accurate dvds chronicling the birth of when it was n't about the money bling the artists '' interviewed are telling the real story a must have for all the aspiring dj 's mc 's and dancers of today
it amazes me how something like ' that is so inventive exhilerating and positive could have only been in the mainstream media for less than 2 years circa but a fad like being a gangster that is so negative has been in the mainstream media for nearly 15 years ! nwa introduced it in the late 80 's it 's sad to see that hip hop has turned into the very thing that it swore to diminish
i wanted to do a grad school paper on something i was interested in researching and i picked after working for an underground magazine i 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that i was too young to understand being born in i visited the university of in chicago interviewed underground artists and went to breaking shows in the illinois area although i thought i was very familiar with after working with this magazine i realized i knew nothing so when i was given the chance to do my research paper i knew that i would be able to learn even more than i already knew from working for the magazine i watched the three parts of beef '' first and saw an ad for this movie in the extras section honestly the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous wiggles was but then after fully watching the preview i realized this was the perfect movie for me to find out more about breaking this movie documented the founding members discussed the four elements of gave a lot of background information on kool herc and grandmaster flash talked about the different techniques in breaking the label breakdancing '' the media 's dilution of breaking the first movies that breaking was showcased in new breaking groups just a bunch of firsts '' it was a great reference for my paper i enjoyed watching it and i could watch it over and over again i have a lot of respect for the founders because without them headz would n't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically mentally and verbally
covering all aspects of culture this great documentary is a must have for all those who always loved you may drop a tear or two at the end of it just for serious cats just explendid
this has to be the freshest documentary i 've ever seen ! ! ! ! from the early days in with kool herc and the rock steady crew you are treated to the best footage and interviews on this planet ! ! everything is covered here you wo n't be dissapointed much love to all and in the universe much respect to crazy legs and company for a job well done if you love breaking you ca n't miss this one ! ! dj grass miami fl
i am a 'professional ' female in my 30 's and remember and love breakdancing i am soooo glad i bought this dvd which i plan on giving to my son for his birthday but now the dvd will be ours ! what 's great about it is that it shows the old 80 's stars clips and then talks to the same people all grown up in their 's today you will watch this over and over ! great history and roots of this nyc then west coast phenomenon if only today 's hip hop rap were as fun and clean as breakdancing
this dvd totally covers pretty much everything you should know about the and culture as far as how it started to where it stands today the interviews are raw and to the point from the footage of the early days to the present is very well put together it just all flows very fresh also the special features is n't just a bunch of crap which usually gets put on dvd 's this dvd is way worth the price and well wicked buy it ! peace
this video is definitely a worth wild dvd from the original footage to today it was all great i watched it three times over the weekend and still saw new moves that ive never saw before its a great investment crazy legs is the man
ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house 8 women every one of them with their affective lacks their tribulations little miseries sorrows and disillusions each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered marcel the admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage with a sublime red carpet that remind us bergman in cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top alfred hitchcock vertigo expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses a !
seemingly a french on the classic english mystery play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy women of all ages are especially french women starring catherine deneuve virginie ledoyen ludivine sagnier isabelle huppert danielle darrieux fanny ardant firmine richard emmanuelle
a previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values however even though there are elements of the risque in the film the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all i thought that the plot the scenery the songs and everything else was all great it is a french musical whodunnit but one that does n't take itsself too seriously whoever wrote the bad review should n't take it so seriously either besides it 's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate my favorite characters were played by denouve and huppert both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required then again it is a musical so disbelief should be left at the door
having stumbled onto this film being played on tv late last night and given that emmanuelle bart was in this i was immediately hooked into watching it as has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais deneuve bart fanny ardant isabelle huppert the list goes on and being that the story revolves around these 8 women yes i know but there was really no other way of putting it it keeps you locked in what i found fascinating were the songs now normally i hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random think rocky horror picture show but this i can tolerate the songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it 's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs it 's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes which is pure brilliance even if you do n't like french pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which when it breaks into a song is exactly what it becomes ! the basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead so whodunnit this leads to questions over betrayal family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses there seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie no ifs no ands no buts ! oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film i will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry it 's that good ! just simply superb there 's nothing else to add
this farcical who done it '' is funny absurd campish and silly all at the same time starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the french cinema 8 femmes reminds me of similar who done its '' such as agatha christie 's ten little indians and especially neil simon 's murder by death adapted from the play by robert thomas which accounts for the stage play feel to the production this one begins as a proper murder mystery might with a murder in a house out in the country somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion while neil simon made fun of detectives in murder by death and agatha christie made fun of murder period here the fun is on the players themselves what follows as all point fingers away from themselves is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about the scandalous revelations including interracial lesbianism and heterosexual incest are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties note suzon 's pony skirt to quote a line from the film it 's a sad family affair '' played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight yet there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film strange in another sense this is a celebration of some of the french cinema 's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs catherine deneuve heads the cast as gaby the wife of the murdered she looks stately beautiful and more than a bit spoiled danielle darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother mamy isabelle huppert makes herself into a neurotic dotty old maid named augustine while emmanuelle beart plays louise the sexy maid fanny ardant is pierrette gaby 's scandalous the cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet way in a kind of gender joke no men appear in the movie although we do see the back of marcel gaby 's husband a couple of times you will not be able to guess who done it but i will not tell you why see this for danielle darrieux one the grande dames of the french cinema whose film credits go back to 1931 yes 1931. she has a lot of fun in a juicy part
yes this murder mystery is twisted and dark but also wonderful to watch all the characters with the possible exception of the father are so intriguing and bizarre and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat what a nasty family but one ca n't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates they put the fun in the word dysfunctional without a doubt beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery true that it is primarily shot indoors but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot i do n't know but it is certainly a feast for the eyes the story itself is pretty good and not difficult to follow but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss
8 women is a good murder mystery with humor light heartedness and mystery it combines a bunch of the best french actrices and an enjoyable plot a real guesser until the end
wall street the movie starring michael douglas is lame compared with this docutainment whereas the first offering is fictitious the latter is enron a global brand that 's since become a verb and even becoming skits in the simpsons ! how would a company that started out humbly would grow so fast so big in a few years would then taking record breaking speed to go bankrupt and then ruining the livelihood of so many ordinary people and that it puts the bush family in an awkward situation for being overfriendly with ken lay the founder of enron in the early days this docutainment could have been a dry boring subject and yet it 's captivating to view the authors believed that what made enron so enticing to the public mass is its human tragedy aspect brilliant people who would be so blinded by their own arrogance pride narcissim brilliance greed that they would do something so stupid for digging a hole so big and so deep that they could n't get themselves out of it this docutainment is the story about ken lay jeff skilling the fall guy falstow the cfo who would be left to hang to dry and their doings that would have such a detrimental impact on so many people it 's outrageous to hear the tape recording of enron traders of bragging the money that they were making at expense of california power crisis somehow human tragedy of such epic proportion shall repeat itself again someday because we humans do n't seem to learn from mistakes an intriguing documentary that needs to be seen to be believed
this is an excellent portrayal of the enron fiasco it utilizes footage and sound bites and interviews it 's absolutely amazing what happened ! this film is a must see for everyone
because the enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in american history this documentary sums up in a nice little package how organized and crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms more importantly this documentary shows how the american criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations as a result of the aforementioned i use this as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike
the documentary enron the smartest guys in the room had a bit of a rough start although intriguing it failed to deliver the rough sketch of the enron scandal quick enough i 'll shamefully admit that i had forgotten most of the details of the enron scandal as i was in college when it broke and i did n't care too much about it at the time but once the overall story had been discussed this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation 's downfall the depictions of skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie which was based on a book she amusing use of music and kept the pace quick and unlike michael moore 's documentaries this one was actually full of well presented facts i 'd definitely recommend seeing this movie especially because it reveals yet another reason to hate w and his administration i wish more people were interested in this kind of reporting and that our media was this intellectually engaging
the news did not really give justice to what was really happening with enron during that time why it fell how some people wondered why they did not have data like a normal company this movie is just wonderful it shows how they made a total joke of the american stock market and got away with it power outages in california were actually intentional by enron the story goes on obviously after the movie has been filmed with that misterious death of ken ley sucide also resulted as a consequence of this crash many people have no savings yet has anyone gone to jail over this yet watch how much fun they were having in the hay day of enron how they played hard and how a few people got really rich while others were devistated this is an imporatant movie then you might want to review the more recent news on the company to see where we are at now where is jeffrey skilling now last i knew he still was not in jail who will be punished for this or is it okay because of our new corporate climate okay in the sense of the law of the usa that is martha stewart went to jail and served time will anyone for this
i am a cpa i watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take essentially because of the fall of enron i have since bought the video watched it at least 5 other times of course there are political slants for example they try tie the bush administration s to enron but the majority of the film deals with what happened to enron so that in the end the stock you purchased was worth 0 i would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary a riveting documentary on the rise fall of enron who the major players in enron were
kenneth lay and his cohorts were looking to make millions not for the company but for themselves they took advantage of the investors the employees and the public they knew what they were doing and were stopping at nothing to get what they wanted the chips came crashing down when speculation from a fortune magazine writer saw that the financial figures did n't add up skilling knew that the company was facing severe trouble if it were found that they were tampering with numbers and taking millions from the corporation enron fell hard like the world trade center when it was reported that its earnings were dropping like flies and bankruptcy was the ultimate demise the documentary explores the dark side of humans lay skilling and fastow were ruthless as well as greedy hoarding large sums of money for their personal use putting employees out of work and leaving them with no nest egg they cashed out their stocks and rested on their earnings while their side employees have to suffer not only the financially but emotionally this is a very good documentary to watch no one should be scared not to invest in the stock market but always be careful and alert as to how this company is operating
at first i was n't too keen on seeing this its title smartest guys in the suggested to me that it would be about a bunch of smart guys number crunching on their way to faking accounting records what else would a bunch of 'smart guys ' do well certainly the enron executives did this the film explains in easy to understand terms how chief operating officer jeff skilling demanded the use of 'mark to marketing ' an accounting scheme allowing him to post 'future profits ' of an new idea immediately ie if an idea of inventing a new spaceship design is expected to reap a billion dollars in the future one could post the profits now never mind that the ship may never get built if built may not work as envisioned or people may loose interest in space and so on of course such profits were not 'real ' but nicely balanced off enron 's actual massive losses also balancing off enron 's massive losses were the fake companies created by andy fastow which he used to bury enron 's enormous and in the meantime pocketed millions for himself but while shady accounting schemes may explain the technical proximate causes of the fall of enron it is not the ultimate explanation the ultimate reason why enron fell is pure naked and all to greed and this is what the film portrays and does so brilliantly with insider footage showing 'enron skits ' and meetings and recordings of conversations and deals being made in the trading floor we get to see jeff skilling in a skit in which he snickers and mocks his own accounting strategy stating we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line '' we see andy fastow in an insider video with a sly grin on his face explaining to greedy bankers all the big guns like citibank deutsche bank etc his scheme to be the cfo of both his shell company ljm and enron never mind any conflict of interest as he will always be on 'ljm 's side of the transaction '' netting both him and the greedy bankers money at the expense of enron even worse was the greedy cut throat culture that developed among enron traders my jaw dropped as i heard one trader coolly telling a california energy power station to 'power down ' for a bit by 'making up ' an excuse so they could artificially limit california 's energy supply to make obscene profits even worse were traders laughing hysterically and cheering as energy power lines burned in california chanting burn baby burn ! ! '' and why not supposedly a young trader could make enough in one afternoon to buy a mercedes benz flat out ! other facets of the ugly face of enron included the bizarre 'extreme sport ' trips taken by enron execs bunch of guys riding motor cycles in the dirt and the practice of taking clients out to strip clubs and charging it to the corporate account exemplified by lou pai but was popular among the rest as when this was eventually cancelled at the severe protest of some female employees apparently a pall of silence fell over the trading floor for 3 days ! there is also enron 's arrogance that it could 'trade ' everything including the weather ! jeff skilling comes off as particularly he states he wanted to help fortune reporter bethany mclean understand what she is asking '' when she wanted to know why enron 's numbers did n't add up when despite his bullying she decided to publish her findings or lack of anyway he amazingly calls her decision 'unethical ' well clearly mclean did know what she was is enron overpriced '' was the first article suggesting something maybe wrong with enron later he calls someone else who questioned the validity of enron 's accounting an a h '' compared to skilling and the others ken lay comes off as rather clueless but just as greedy it is almost as if he did n't really care what went on in his company as long as it made money we see him on comparing enron 's troubles to but stating with confidence that things will bounce back later when enron is in a free fall he makes bizarre claims to his worried employees that the company is strong and will regain healthy stock figures causing one of his employees to ask him are you are on crack '' indeed the film also highlights the fact that guilt for the enron debacle falls far beyond enron itself greedy corporate banks actively participated in illegal deals with fastow as mentioned above accounting firm arthur anderson happily cooked enron 's books with accounting and other accounding frauds and then shredded millions of documents when investigations began stock analysts happily took jeff skilling 's word that enron 's stock was doing and issued 'strong buy ' or 'buy ' ratings without actually analyzing the stock lawyers signed off on everything and the rest of us dazzled by the stock market boom and greedy at the thought of making big bucks kept buying enron stock no one ever asked why '' enron was such a shining and whether it really deserved to be the insider material on enron the recordings the videos alone would have made a fascinating shocking tale but the movie adds incisive fast paced interviews with both insiders and critics of enron as well as catchy and very appropriate theme tunes fantasy ' for andy fastow is particularly as it sounds like mr fastow ! ' as amazon suggests watch this move with the corporation the corporation provides the theoretical background as to the psychopathic nature of all corporations while this movie provides the perfect feature length
do n't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching enron the smartest guys in the room '' a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary based on the book by bethany mclean and peter elkind that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of enron which in the years since it happened has come to stand for everything that 's wrong with corporate america it is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed that the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy in fact more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of enron and the sinking of the titanic an apt analogy if ever there was one only in this case the captains had no intention of going down with the ship preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats the beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane details the movie introduces us to the key players primarily ceos jeffrey skilling and ken lay and cfo andrew fastow showing the process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world then slowly destroyed it through deceit hubris and greed but not of course before bestowing obscene dollar packages on themselves as compensation we see how they employed little more than accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors regulatory commissions and fellow employees however the film makes it clear that a large number of reputable '' banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company 's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively as always it is the little guy '' who winds up getting shafted probably the greatest section of the film involves enron 's creation and manipulation of california 's bogus energy crisis '' in the early 2000 's which drained billions from the treasury a situation which the newly elected president bush ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business refused to help rectify just as bad is the ceos ' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company 's plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct with hissable villains like these around who needs fiction the sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down there 's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee it should be noted that the film predates ken lay 's death in 2006 the movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the heroes '' in the story primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for fortune magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes this is more than just a mere talking heads '' documentary it explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism and corporate corruption the movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their nerd '' image and to establish their bona fides as real macho '' men the fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie 's title that little ironic kick by all means do n't miss this film though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it 's over
this dvd i received was way better than chocolate the dvd was quick in getting sent to me and i loved being able to track it and know exactly when it should be here by the dvd was in wonderful condition new in fact and wonderful
honestly i was n't certain about this film in fact at first i actually believed it was related to chocolate '' i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised upon first viewing i did not laugh as much as the second time yes i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time second viewing was a belly full of laughter this is the best lesbian comedy i have ever seen the acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced now that i decided that this film is exceptional it was time to put it to the test on others mostly women 20 's 80 's years some men each person i shared this film with either loaning it or viewing it together all responded similarly this is a hysterically funny film '' what is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process about days congratulations sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art many short films i have seen on the spiritual cinema circle '' also have numerous low budget wonderful productions hoorah for the film art genius i applaud the entire talented cast and crew especially actress christine cox her performance was exceptionally wonderful i would like to see her in more comedies she 's a natural i fell in love with her '' and i am straight gal as are all of the actresses except for frances a must see funny film i always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious we need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as better than chocolate '' thanks bunches
plot twists everywhere ! a movie of many in one but blended together so well it 's an exhilirating rollercoaster of love lust and the bonds of family we do n't know anything about maggie karyn dwyer before she comes to this interesting part of town '' other than she 's left university to find herself and be herself she gets a phone call from her mother who does n't know she 's a lesbian and the fun begins mother lila wendy crewson is divorcing her husband and with brother paul kevin mundy in tow needs a place to stay maggie finds a loft as a sublet but there is a snag after performing a lip synching at a club she 's met the girl of her dreams kim christina cox is staying with maggie as well now to keep the affair from lila ! kim is torn she wants maggie to come out to her mother so they do n't have to hide their relationship she wants maggie to be able to openly declare her love for her but maggie is so afraid the fear ultimatly threatens to tear the two women apart we meet maggie 's friends her boss frances macdonald her friend a transexual named judy jerry outerbridge her carla marya delver and coffee shop owner tony tony nappo frances is at war with customs as they continually threaten her livlihood by witholding shipments of books and videos for her store carla is a free spirit who likes hard centers soft centers all the chocolates in the box '' judy who is under the misundersanding that her father has forgiven her for becoming a transexual befriends lila and starts bringing her around to maggie 's point of view inadvertantly maggie 's friends begin introducing lila and paul to new and exciting experiences maggie 's fears of coming out to her mother are soon alieviated when lila discovers her in bed with kim and the conflict grows amid gay bashing and hate crimes the outcome of the movie is perfectly tied up and delightful helped along with an astounding soundtrack this is one movie you simply must add to your collection
very simply it was good i thought it to be funny and real i 'd watch it again
i really hope that no one was expecting an oscar worthy performance no not the best movie ever as far as plot and acting but i remember seeing too many high dollar ads for it do you it was a damn good feel good movie though this movie will help point out a few issues the glbt community faces but barely scratches the surface if it is erotic lesbians you seek keep seeking even the uncut version is barely r '' worthy so once again everyone not a pent house flick not a documentary and in no way is it oscar worthy and with all that said it was one of the best romantic comedies seen in a long time i highly recomend it to anyone just looking for a relaxing evening
it 's hard to mix a meaningful important message with fun and laughs better than chocolate is the best example of that successful combination an important plot full of emotion and difficult situations mixes with humor and sexuality to create a full plate of entertainment with this film character development is superb making the viewing experience that much more interesting there 's not a boring part in fact more than one story harmoniously combines with others to engage the mind and senses the film is not a serious drama but it 's not only a comedy the characters are real the humor flows naturally even though i know how the story ends i 'll watch it over and over
my partner and i really enjoyed this movie there are alot of issues that we can relate to judy gives trans gender people a good name all the caracters rolls are positive and i think that it shows its not all about sex there is love involved definetly a must see ! ! !
when i first watched this movie yes i did realize it was poorly written and what ever but i love this movie because it helped me to get courage to finally tell my mom i was gay i think this person who left the last comment was way too dramatic they just dont know how to appreciate things also he threw it way out of proportion by saying he should 've got rent what a stupid idea rent was even worse
thank god for this essentially preserved movie version of the stage hit by one of my all time favorite broadway actresses gwen verdon she just lights up the screen bob fosse 's dances are spectacular and the music by ross and adler is just classic they just do n't make them like this anymore sheer heaven in the devil played by the incomparable ray walston if you love musicals you must add this to your collection !
certain movies really capture the feel of their themes and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of baseball like no other of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned but have n't we learned by now that the devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals i hope so what a great cast of performers nothing was lost from the broadway stage in this production and nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to dvd through the magic of hollywood when done to perfection film can even enhance the story and few have done the job with a musical as well as this gem thanks largely to the astounding talent of bob fosse 's choreography tab hunter 's shining moment gwen verdon 's 'whatever lola wants ' is the showstopper but ray walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny devil a film favorite for most of my life
i remeber seeing this movie baasically when it was first released and as i have a large collection of musicals i wanted to add it to my collection as i had not seen it available in australia after viewing damn yankees after 40 50 years was very enjoyable gwen verdon great and tab hunter yes
once upon a time broadway musicals were quickly adapted into successful widescreen presentations often but not always with the original broadway stars this is an example of one of hollywood 's best a previous reviewer called this stagebound i am not sure what was meant my fair lady '' and mary poppins '' are musicals shot entirely on soundstages and look it damn yankees ! '' involved several outside locations including the old los angeles wrigley field which was home to the los angeles angels in their first season in 1961. it was a great backdrop for the shoeless joe '' number the film is not in stereo even though the cd soundtrack is i do n't know if the stereo soundtrack album would matchup with the film soundtrack or whether there stereo tracks recorded in any event warner did not dig them out and this dvd is bereft of any significant extras apart from that this is a must buy for classic performances ray walston and gwen verdon particularly wonderful songs you got ta have heart shoeless joe etc and some great smaller roles the crusty senators ' manager jean stapleton playing edith bunker 15 years before she played edith bunker and bob fosse dancing with gwen verdon
gwen verdon at her finest great performances by an amazing cast great music and incredible choregraphy gwen verdon and bob fosse such a team
the quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50 's scene cool man '' but the transition to dvd has not hurt it a bit the songs and dancing are very stylized definitely reflecting donen 's handicraft seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting i definitely enjoyed it
this classic show was skillfully brought to film and the casting is great gwen verdon is fabulous as lola and ray walston as the devil is superb well worth having for collectors of american musical theater
thankfully unlike other movies that i remembered seeing years ago this one lived up to expectations with ray walston as the devil stealing the show
ray walston is perfect as the endearingly likable devil gwen virdon is teriffic as lola the vamp and tab hunter is perfectly believable as joe hardy great dancing great songs got ta have heart '' whatever lola wants '' and two lost souls '' great love story and great actual shots of mickey mantle and gil macdougald in action makes for a winner
with an cast direction with the artistry characteristic of a spike lee joint and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending inside man is an heist thriller however as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary and inside man is no exception at times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary america from a child 's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold i liked that part of the movie but i can understand how others are bored with lee 's tactics overall the plot direction and cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance
if you like action shooting explosions fire pain torture and revenge this is a movie you 'll love and it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role a great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality
spike lee finally came through on his fourth film with washington this film is very moving and intriguing nail biting exciting smart casting and directing clive owen wanted to help out those who deserve it unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur selling himself out and trying to hide his past this film demonstrated that everyone has demons and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past and how rich you are there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride furthermore jodie was playing a dirty lawyer stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable betrayal this film had all aspects of our human nature what more can anyone ask for it makes you think would you risk your life to prove that someone else 's life is worth more than yours if you get caught
need i say more like everymovie he acts in good story line with a
one of denzel 's finest movies but anything he 's in has to be good or better
inside man '' unfolds its characters and plot in seeming perhaps a bit like a hostage drama the film 's plot advances by millimeters in a seemingly unknowable direction folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals the film always returns to the present sometimes but not always enriched by its wanderings a hostage situation develops at a new york city bank dozens of hostages are taken and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence keith frazier an nypd detective and hostage negotiator played by denzel washington is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis but this is no ordinary hostage situation as the are n't playing by the normal rules what are they after why are they stalling for time the bank 's philanthropist owner christopher plummer has taken an unusual interest in the situation when he contacts a high society fixer jodi foster to retrieve property from the besieged bank it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank foster washington and the lead hostage taker played with intelligence and canny reserve by clive owen soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity spike lee 's cinematography is terrific a long shot of the brooklyn bridge is just one of many ornaments to this film the writing and the plot are believable and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies the final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film other than the pace of the film which mimics the pace of real negotiations but is slow to the point of torpor inside man '' is brilliant
i 've seen quite a few movies trying to win the title the prefect bank robbery '' for the crime they describe this one wins the jackpot the robbery 's whole concept is ingenious just when i thought there could n't be any real innovations in this field comes inside man '' to show me how wrong i was from the beginning to the end this film is nothing but professional and completely believable i watched the screen and said to myself for heaven 's sake people could actually pull it off ! '' add to that the top notch cast denzel washington judie foster and clive owen and you get a film you would n't want to miss
i have seen the original dutch version by director sluizer and this one holds up quite well on its own jeff harriman kiefer sutherland stops at a gas station with his girlfriend diane sandra bullock in a matter of minutes she disappears without a trace and although jeff searches everywhere for her she vanishes without ever being heard from again he lives every moment of his life trying to locate her putting flyers everywhere and even going on tv the abducter of diane is barney cousins jeff bridges i do n't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her however i will write that barney contacts jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate diane after so many years he gives jeff a chance to experience what happened to diane but at a cost enter rita baker nancy travis who is also the latest love interest of jeff her role in the film is very important barney cousins is a sociopath and he has been abducting women for some time how long the viewer is never told but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction he is very methodical as i wrote in the beginnig i have seen the original and while it is quite good this film also is a very good and suspenseful film the character of the sociopath played by jeff bridges is very good he is very convincing in his part as for kiefer sutherland i thought he gave a very good performance disregard some of the negative reviews on this film just because the original is on criterion and in dutch does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film i have the dvd but it is only listed on vhs at amazon it might be out of print if you can grab the dvd i assure you that you will not be disappointed stars 4.5
an extraordinary film the vanishing brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest the movie falls into the type of category kiefer sutherland jeff bridges nancy travis sandra bullock and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot jeff 's strong sense of love devotion and determination are admirable and commendable and an example for all to follow ! the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! in short the vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection !
this movie starts a little slow but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little thing '' that just makes him creepy typical of an early thriller this movie is sure to entertain if you liked fear '' then you will like the vanishing '' as well
in 1988 director george sluizer had directed a film entitled the vanishing the film was all in dutch and starred dutch actors who are nowhere near in this country in 1993 director george sluizer who had directed the original dutch film had decided to direct a remake of his own film this time casting a cast that consists of kiefer sutherland nancy travis sandra bullock jeff bridges the film is almost the same as the original dutch version but this one is much more worth the time and money jeff harriman played by kiefer sutherland and his girlfriend diane shaver played by sandra bullock are driving to the mountains for vacation they have a little spout after their car runs out of gas while in a dark tunnel leaving diane there jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station he comes back to find diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel upset and distraught they pull into a gas station where diane has jeff who laughs with cheerfulness repeat an apology they kiss passionately where diane heads into the store to buy her and jeff some cold beers a goes by and diane has not yet returned he searches the store as well as the whole ground but diane is nowhere to be found three years later jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend every month for the last three years jeff would renew the posters he had printed of diane he has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped diane to tell him where she is he walks into a diner one night still very miserable and meets rita baker played by nancy travis rita is instantly attracted to jeff jeff and rita begin a love affair together jeff tries to move on with his life but he can not for he is still searching for diane rita finds out about what jeff is doing behind her back she tries to help get over his obsession but it does n't work jeff receives a letter from a man named barney cousins played by jeff bridges jeff shows rita the letter but she realizes that his obsession is still going on where she leaves him she goes to their appartment packs her things changes the outgoing message on their answering machine jeff returns home and changes the machine himself but as the recording is still going barney appears jeff beats the hell out of him but barney reveals that he can tell him where diane is and that in order for jeff to find out what happened to her he 'd have to ride with barney while at a bar with her girlfriend rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message but rita hears that jeff had already changed it to which she finds barney 's voice on the machine she realizes that jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him but jeff and barney are already on their way rita finds out what happened from her neighbor where her neighbor gives rita the license plate number to barney 's car with this license plate rita finds out where barney lives and drives off to his place jeff and barney arrive at the gas station where diane was last seen three years earlier barney hands jeff a cup of coffee where barney informs jeff that the coffee is drugged he tells jeff that in order to find out what happened to diane jeff has to go through the exact same details that diane had gone through jeff through hurtful tears drinks the coffee and blacks out he wakes up to darkness he flips on his lighter to find himself locked in a coffin and buried alive outside barney 's vacation cabin in the woods barney had done this to poor diane who after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid is now dead rita arrives at barney 's house where she meets barney 's daughter denise played by maggie linderman she asks rita to giver her a ride to the carnival as long as she does n't say a word to to barney rita asks denise how to get to the summer cabin where barney is at denise gives her the directions and rita is on her way she arrives and has a brief brawl with barney she stops when he is about to kill her she is now seated inside his cabin talking with barney trying to find out what he did with jeff she notices the dirt on his shoes the dirt on a shovel standing beside the door and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass and realizes that barney had buried jeff alive she knocks barney and begins digging up jeff but not before barney awakens and begins brawling again with rita did jeff suffocate and bite the dust as diane had done will barney kill of rita as well the only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of the vanishing i have read the reviews from many reviewers and i can not believe that anyone would hate this remake so what the ending was changed i do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie this movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake kiefer sutherland again proves that he is the best actor on this planet maybe even in this whole galaxy this movie is one kiefer 's best starring roles and i recommend it to any kiefer sutherland fan who has not yet seen this film
this movie maybe a remake but it keeps you at the edge of your seat you do n't ever want to get up you always want to know what is going to happen next it is a great mystery and it is very realistic ! 5 stars for a great movie
i glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is intellectual '' because it is made anywhere but the usa in their eyes america can do no right my other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame
boyz n the hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990 's it is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in urban america where youth gangs run rampant during the course of the story it offers much needed commentary on the situation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it at the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says one out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime most will be killed at the hands of another black male '' if anything that fact is even worse today most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film but many of these films today are all shoot up movies that have no morality strong plot or serious social message the setting of this flick is south central where murder rates are five times the nationwide average or in absolute figures double the entire 's death rate for breast cancer over the past two decades the los angeles police department has accumulated a backlog of unsolved homicides roughly of the city 's total this gripping tale evolves around a single black father furious styles laurence fishburne raising his one and only son styles cuba gooding and installing in him the values to help him become a man this is an important point that director john singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers the values that furious styles instills in tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today essentially boyz n the hood is a movie about peace its message is that violence is n't the answer and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available the movie starts when tre 's mother sends him to live with his father jason furious '' who is much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this the movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old tre and his best friend ricky about to graduate from high school while another friend doughboy has already graduated from shoplifting to guns and drug deals and while furious guides tre towards moral choices responsibility and doughboy and ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring the basic plot to boyz n the hood is can tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal decent life this is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him boyz n the hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings it shows the dire straits that folks in the south central are in without being conscending or exploitative boyz n the hood is a flick that is well written acted and directed the cinematography is stunning
this is truly a brilliant movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the real '' hood is really like for me this was nothing less than educational i could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale the hood which they are powerless to escape or ignore this is more than just a movie it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down and exposes the humanity of the characters when watching the movie i could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood but humans with hopes feelings and aspirations just like you and me what more can i say except bravo !
this is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of african americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of as you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends you truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born ice cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal from fights on the corner to drive by shootings this movie truly captures the struggle millions of african americans go through as we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto to when they are old enough to get out they still seem to be the same their customs dont change simply because of their surrounding guns liquor poverty and crime they have no other option than do join in when dough boy 's ice cube brother ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto the whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also so everyone is supporting him until a tragedy is brought upon the family this story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys
he kept it real thats all i can say aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word i just cant help it everybody in the hood cusses but
good movie from the years tre has to live with his dad after getting into a fight with bobby the boy he walked to school with i like the part when tre ricky doughboy and little chris or chris were part when doughboy said she loved that fool more than she loved me i think it was pretty think he said fool but if he did that ment you know what ever ! i know part of this review sounds stupid
despite what some people might think boyz n the hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle it is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in america i would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie this was john singleton 's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them cuba gooding jr is superb as tre styles a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father furious lawrence fishburne furious is also played excellently by fishburne despite appearing as strict he keeps tre on the right path and as a 17 year old tre is a mature and well rounded individual tre 's friends are brothers doughboy ice cube ricky morris chestnut two very different people ricky like tre is an aspiring college student while doughboy is fresh out of jail and looked down upon by his mother the script is so well written that even a character like doughboy can be sympathised with though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface he is also loyal and caring to his friends it is the depth of all the characters and several superb acting performances that make the film so great i do n't want to give away any plot details for those who have n't seen it but the film is really tragic in the end and is a realistic take on life in the hood in south central i do n't care where your from or what colour your skin is you can enjoy and be moved by this film a true masterpiece
boyz n the hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named tre styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of south central los angeles after a confrontation with a classmate at his school tre 's mother forces him to go and live with his father furious she says the last thing i want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed look at me i 'm serious i love you you 're my only son '' she just ca n't take his problems anymore after being dropped off at his fathers place tre grows through 5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old all the while furious tells tre you know tre you may think i 'm being hard on you right now but i 'm not what i 'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible its like your little friends across the street they do n't have anybody to show them how to do that and you 're gon na see how they end up too '' his next door neighbors chris doughboy and ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into usc on a scholarship meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang the crips pushing drugs boozing oe and running his mouth ricky and tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive one night at the strip on crenshaw a group of bloods are strolling through and one of them bumps into ricky on purpose trying to start crap he says you lookin at nigga '' ricky shouts back i 'm still trying to find out nigga !

this iz da best drama movie of all da truf nigga ! ! ! ! if ya black you must see it if ya any other race go see it and see what black people has to go through in life
what i enjoy most about this movie is not what i particularly enjoyed when it first came out being 11 when it came out i was attracted to the urbanism of which i was not too familiar with i did n't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood but it was no inglewood either i think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film the urban youth seeing for the first time thier lives on a film of this caliber and the suburban youth somehow glorifying this life while i still enjoy the entire film what i particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film the story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders ca n't be tamed by her she sends him to live with his father who is in many ways her equal but he is a man and one of her lines in the movie is i ca n't teach him how to be a man that 's your job '' how true this is not to sound sexist because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother because of an abusive father etc but you need a man to teach you to be a man larry fishburne 's charachter in this movie does this perfectly one quote i know you think i 'm being hard on you tre but i 'm not what i 'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility your friends across the street do n't have anyone to do that your'e gon na see how they end up too '' i loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents while divorced raise their son the way they know best and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal i 'd have to say that my favorite character is furious yes reva tre 's mom played an equally strong part but i loved how real '' furious was young '' tre i thought played an excellent part better than gooding maybe overall a great movie it 's success made it harder for corporate america to ignore the reality of youth as it exists today
the sentinel '' is n't a movie i entirely expected to like although i 've wanted to see it since it was in theatres even though the plot is different it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called firewall '' even while watching this movie i thought it was similar to firewall '' in many ways but i also found myself entertained by it now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now but a few good ones do come around my favorite movie of this kind is in the line of fire '' it was entertaining well acted made sense and was a great film the sentinel has good performances it 's entertaining but it does n't always make sense it 's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president even if they just want to do it to do it they could 've told us that inside man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning anyway oscar winner michael douglas best actor 'wall street ' plays pete garrison a secret service agent who once took a bullet for ronald reagan years later pete is having an affair with the first lady kim basinger and is at odds with his former best friend david breckinridge a marvelous kiefer sutherland also a secret service agent see david is under the impression that pete had an affair with his wife anyway through a rat pete discovers that there 's a mole in the secret service who 's helping terrorists plot to kill the president at the same time pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and as a result of that evidence is piling up on the fact that pete maybe the mole now with the entire secret service after him including david and his new partner jill eva longoria who 's got some good acting chops away from wisteria lane this movie has its share of cliches there was a few times where i was watching this movie and thinking to myself that familiar '' i saw the end coming from a mile away but the ending quickly redeems itself from my anyway with the relationship between pete and the first lady not going in the direction you 'd think a lot of people wo n't like this film for reasons i 've mentioned and more but if you want some entertainment although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws then the sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time due to its flaws with only the fact that i enjoyed it to support my case i should give it 4 stars but i think that it 's worthy enough of 5. entertainment goes a long way grade a
i actually liked this movie and i do n't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie i do n't know anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay i am not going into the movies detail because i do n't want to ruin the story for somebody i will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all rent it then maybe buy it if you like it
very good bu not as good as the other films of michael dont understand the full screen is higher price than widescreen
frankly the idea of a secret service agent having an affair with the president 's wife is way out there in the first place michael douglas not withstanding if you like keefer sutherland as in tv 's 24 you will probably like this movie his name could have been jack bower in this flick too i thought it had good action writing acting and directing i would not mind seeing keefer and michael teamed up again on the same side i bought the dvd but then again i collect movies for the actors
i purchased this movie basically to see my favorite chick eva longoria but i ended up loving the movie i would recommend it to anyone
good movie have always been a fan of michael douglas again he has done some fine work
kiefer sutherland does his usually excellent job and michael douglas was also very good
i can not believe how many negative reviews this film actually received were they watching the same movie i was watching i generally concider myself very critical when it comes to political thrillers such as the sentinel '' so i am not going to just generally give such a movie of one of my favorite genres a high rating automatically without giving it some the sentinel '' is everything that an intense political thriller should be the acting is quite convincing and the suspense is riveting i guarantee you will be pinned to the edge of your seat through the entire film and then some also the scenario is extremely plausible especially in today 's world with all the militant groups out there from to islamic radicals who would stop at nothing to make an assination attempt or terrorist attack against the president or some institution my advice is before listening to the negative rants of the other reviewers of this film go ahead and take a look at it yourself it 's a safe bet that you will not be disappointed
i own the first two volumes of the lost treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat they are brilliant and i hope more volumes appear on a regular basis why though must i suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get the plays volume without buying them all over again i suspect and hope that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime i can only say that if you do n't already own any of these and are a fan of broadway theatre or the performing arts in general buy this today ! a fantastic showcase of theatrical talent
being a farm boy from illinois '' could have been in a foreign country and i would have never been wiser area schools performed shows written especially for high schools like mississippi melody '' and up on old smokey '' in 1971 i had just purchased a reel to reel tape recorder and was anxious to do a bit of experimentation with it as fate would have it i saw an ad on cbs for the 1971 tony awards telecast and thought i 'd see what kind of sound quality i would get from the tinny little speaker on the television i had no idea the format for that year was to perform 1 song from each show using as many of the original cast members as possible even though the sound quality was far less than perfect i realized i had an audio tape of more original cast members singing songs from broadway shows than i could shake a stick at and many of the songs were familiar from television variety shows like ed sullivan etc i went away to college taking my recording with me and thoroughly annoyed my dormmates with it it was good to listen to while cleaning my room but i had the advantage that i could recall what was on the television screen fell by the wayside for cassette tapes and finally cd the tape became brittle and would break many times over and electronic manufacturers slowly pulled from the market now 30 years later i 'm actually seeing the performances again remember this was years before home video recordings the 1971 broadcast is heavily used throughout broadway 's lost treasures i ii and iii the telecast that year used the giant lighted years as the backdrop for the songs plus i found out that things like a clunk '' in the audio of if i were a rich man '' was not caused by me but it was zero mostel hitting the stage wagon with his shoe one performance i can recall in particular that has not been used yet is the one where the female announcer says then came the sparkling 'high button shoes ' and every bit as lovely then as she is now nanette fabray '' so i guess there 's still enough material out there for broadway 's lost treasures iv '' get all 3 dvds for your collection because it 's nice to have something when you simply want to be entertained and do n't want to be bothered with a story line
mandy patinkin was shown only in one small part of evita '' that was very disappointing and i thought by the title he would be one of the hosts or at least a larger segment of him in evita '' so why was he advertised in the title the show was put together very well and the quality of the color and the production is excelent it had a effect which is very prominent especially with the hosting of jerry orbach the shows chosen were all of my favorites and so i was pleased with that part of the cd but not enough of mandy patinkin i do n't think that you should advertise this cd by using mandy 's name as a come on it sure fooled me
i ordered this dvd when it first came out and i 've been enjoying it ever since all the performances are some more than others but they are all wonderful nonetheless some of my pesonal favorites include patti lupone bringing down the house along with mandy patinkin and bob gunton doing the song a new argentina '' from evita this is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this dvd anegela lansbury providing a hilarious performance in the worst pies in london '' from sweeny todd the demon barber of fleet street carol channing singing the inspirational before the parade passes by '' from hello dolly ! yul brynner performing shall we dance '' with his not sure of her name this performance is priceless and so is that dress ! john raitt 's beautiful baritone voice soars in this '' hey there '' from the pajama game paul lynde delivers a ton of laughs in kids '' from bye bye birdie joel grey and cast perform the spectacle that is cabaret in the song willkommen '' this song never gets out of your head ! gwen verdon and chita two of broadway 's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from chicago all that jazz '' and nowadays '' bob fosse 's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment jerry orbach his death was a tragic loss to the theater that 's why these dvd 's are so remarkable this is another top the song lullaby of broadway '' from street it was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to nyc to see my very first broadway street andrea mcardle and the orphans perform tomorrow '' and you 're never fully dressed without a smile '' from annie this is just superb there 's absolutely no flaws betty buckley and cast perform two songs from '' jellicle songs '' and the classic memory '' it is stunning to watch any performance with patti lupone in it is a gem in itself this buenos aires '' from evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of eva peron bonnie franklin and cast are hilarious in the song '' applause '' from the show applause the whole theme to the song is 100 true and kind of hits home '' for every actor plus it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you 're a big fan of musicals all in all this dvd is totally worth buying ! and after you 're through with this one and have memorized all the songs check out broadway 's lost treasures ii i have yet to receive iii but i am looking forward to it !
i was at the tony awards broadcast in march of 1971 and i thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory and then lo and behold we get this marvelous record of theater history many of the performances were from the mostel john raitt robert preston carol channing which was the silver anniversary of the tony 's full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater i 'm so looking forward to the other dvd 's of performances that were not included if you want to see the legends of broadway perform their signature songs then this is the tape for you
i saw this show on pbs and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on i do n't know of any other way to be able to see yul brynner 's commanding king and i performance loved it
if you 're a fan of musical theatre you 're almost guaranteed to find something you like on this dvd although the presentation is cheesy with some awful bluescreen effects the musical numbers themselves are entertaining highlights include patti lupone in evita gwen verdon and chita rivera in chicago and bonnie franklin in applause but for me as a fan of both the musical theatre and science fiction the higlight was seeing a young nana visitor major kira on star trek deep space nine dance her little heart out in an impressive dance number from my one and only in this particular number you will also see a less than comfortable twiggy trying to keep up with the rest of the dancers she looks so out of place next to tommy tune one of the few performances i did n't like was betty buckley singing memory from cats her singing was okay but i just did n't buy her as a cat '' other than that this dvd should warm the hearts of musical lovers around the world
it is very exciting to see these performances for the first time i am more of a fan of wicked and hairspray but this was great ! too good to be true i could have skipped the talking in between as it seemed forced and this is really one you buy just to see these stars doing what they are famous for i love mandy patinkin and wish they still made musicals so he could be doing more of them in movies where was he in chicago '' i mean richard gere
the living daylights '' is actor timothy dalton 's first outing as the british super spy he replaced roger moore whom i regretfully have never seen in a bond film actually i 've only seen 3 bond films prior to this one thunderball you only live twice and diamonds are forever one thing most bond fans agree on is that sean connery was the best james bond i 'd say that 's accurate but dalton 's approach to the character is far different from what we 've previously seen james bond is overall an under developed character he 's a who loves martinis and women in the films i 've seen james bond is given no back story and shows little human emotion do n't get me wrong in this film there 's no either but there is a little emotion anyway the film has a great opening sequence but as usual this sequence has little to do with the rest of the plot it 's merely used to get the audiences pumped for the rest of the story the story involves bond being hired as a sniper to protect a russian officer named georgi koskov koskov is afraid that he is being targeted by a sniper bonds orders are to shoot any sniper he sees that poses a threat to koskov well bond does see a sniper only the sniper is in the form a beautiful cellist named kara maryam d'abo a really hot bond girl making a last minute decision bond opts not to kill kara and instead just wounds her he then transports koskov to a remote hiding spot koskov is then abducted from his hiding place and it 's up to bond to find him as he does with kara 's help of course he uncovers a weapons scheme the plot is really nothing special overall but back to dalton in the previous bond films bond usually woos a bond girl and beds her in this film bond seems to fall in love with her of course there 's no exchange of i love you '' here but the romance is a little different the action sequences are good and the art direction is fantastic it 's nice to bond in a normal place like a fair the scene where bond and kara have to escape from an afghanistan prison is exciting the film does have it 's spot where it lags but this is a worthy entry in the series hell it 's just nice to see a different side of james bond another thing this film does is show a little more skin then you 're used too all the other bond films use mere sexual innuendo in this film you actually grade
the strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon mercenary and a russian general both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades bond will have to face them until unmasking this saga is loaded with admirable sequences fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script the first incursion of timothy dalton was very gratifying because at last bond returns to his origins far from being a simple cartoon character since moore was hired recommended without reserves
i 'm sure folks getting into bond just skip by this one coz dalton only did two films and the assumtion is that his movies must suck if he only lasted for two though dalton is n't given much praise i think he 's quite good in fact to date i have not seen a lousy bond actor each actor had something unique to contribute dalton is alot more serious which probably seemed like a shock after people had spent a decade with the comical roger moore dalton makes a quip here and there and of course he 's required to in the scenes with otherwise in situations where moore would have definitely had a sarcastic remark dalton remains silent another roger and sean and george for that matter were a couple of does n't even seem that interested in women ! aside from scoring a chick in the precredit sequence dalton looks as though he 's ready to settle down with the lead actress ! bond is up against a weasely russian and a psycho arms dealer played by joe don baker mitchell ! ! john gets thrown into the mix too it may not be quite as cool as license to kill but do n't pass it by
for all the annoyance roger moore caused many bond fans he was still the face of bond for 15 years and became our comfortable successor to the role originally helmed by connery now that he finally bowed out after nearly decomposing in octopussy and view to a kill the challenge was on to find the new james bond many hoped pierce brosnan would step into the role at this point but alas he was still obligated to being remington steele on tv somehow or other timothy dalton got the role a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even want the part ! indeed i would have to grudgingly argue that dalton is my least favorite james bond he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did even lazenby in his one outing however and ironically his two films were some of the best the series had to offer beginning with this definite top five contender tld represented a return to the more espionage centered feel of the novels and really only seen in the first two connery films on her majesty 's secret service and moore 's own for your eyes only the main plot revolves around a arms dealer and a secondary plot to assassinate secret agents around the world along the way bond hooks up with a assassin and has one of his few monogamous relationships this alone adds to the believability of the film somehow the producers were able to delve into a rich espionage plot yet still not skimp on the action this film is loaded with action including a new car one of the better ones and several exciting sequences involving the theft and eventual crash of a transport plane the only complaint i have with this film aside from dalton himself is that the villain is pretty weak joe don baker just does n't have the screen presence to be a villain ironically he returns in goldeneye and tomorrow never dies as a and fits that role much better ! jerome krabb fairs a little better but is generally more annoying than anything else marayam d'abo is nice as the bond girl attractive and a good actress as opposed to the usual glamour models that may or may not be able to act ahem barbara bach ahem this was the first bond to replace moneypenny and the actress chosen was serviceable but with little of the memorable flair that samantha bond has brought to the role in the recent brosnan films and dalton this is one of the best of the series and is a welcome return to a grittier and more believable bond dalton 's follow up license to kill would delve even deeper into the gritty side of bond too bad the brosnan films came along and took us back into super bond territory !
this is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series the living daylights is a bond film that has depth and realism the film is n't the typical bond movie it has a hardcore spy plot other films in the series like this includes frwl and ohmss as an actor timothy dalton brought intensity and passion to the role no other bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like dalton did for example in the fair scene dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that saunders was murdered previous bonds did not show emotion like this with the exception of george lazenby dalton 's performance made the movie transcend the title of being just a bond movie '' in some bond films especially the bronsnan entries the gadgets the action the jokes and the escapades overpower the movie 's plot that is not the case with the living daylights there is a balance between action and plot the humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film after watching roger moore 's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch dalton take a darker approach in the living daylights dalton 's monogamous approach also made the film stand out throughout the film bond stayed with one millovy the woman does n't count also an important aspect to me in a bond film is a believable villain this film accomplished just that necros yogi and brad wittiaker made classic intelligent villains cartoonish villains such as jaws make me disgusted with the series in conclusion if you want parody from a bond movie watch entries like the spy who loved me moonraker the man with the golden gun and diamonds are forever however if you want to watch a bond movie with substance watch this movie license to kill from russia with love thunderball and on her majesty 's secret service
this was the first bond film i ever watched years ago when it premiered on abc saturday night movies so i have a soft spot for it it 's still definitely one of the best with an intriguing plot that actually requires the viewer to pay attention without becoming too convoluted probably the most story since from russia with love timmothy dalton 's take on 007 is the grittiest of all the bond actors so far and he manages to find a strong balance between realism and the antics of bond all the usual bond trimmings are here too including the cars gadgets john barry score and even a new actress as moneypenny there are some fantastic action sequences including the opening teaser a car chase on ice and a fight on a cargo plane dalton only made two 007 films before the series went on hiatus and this is the stronger of the two it lacks the dark tone that haunts his licence to kill and feels a bit more timeless this is also a pretty good dvd you get a documentary another documentary on bond creator ian fleming the retro music video of the title song and a fun deleted scene probably cut as it seems like a bit of silliness leftover from the moore years the bad no english subtitles at least on my version my version also lacks the original subtitles on an early sequence where a russian agent seduces her supervisor to provide bond with a distraction it 's a rather funny and i heard mgm corrected this mistake on later pressings of the disc the living daylights still remains one of my favourite bond films and is a for all fans
this is by far the best bond film timothy dalton is brilliant in the lead role giving bond a menacing quality it is a shame we only got to enjoy him as 007 in two films because he was truly awesome as far as the basic standards for bond movies this one delivers the goods beautiful women explosions car chases exotic locations the works ! and and we get to see james bond and miriam d'abo skiing down a mountain in a cello case ! what else could you want
the mystery of how well the new bond would replace roger moore in the fifteenth official '' bond movie was over with the living daylights '' the style of the movie was set with the opening scenes where three agents parachute onto gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise unfortunately someone in the exercise is using real ammunition not paint balls timothy dalton shows that he is made of bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire flies off a cliff and explodes with bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts timothy dalton was a bond in this movie he eliminated the numerous that seemed to be a roger moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more bond in this first of two bond movies dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either sean connery or roger moore but he breathed new life into the series the plot bears some characteristics of a view to a kill '' in that both films portray the soviet union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder gentler soviet union this time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch profiting by buying drugs from afghanistan and selling them in the soviet union unfortunately the money belongs to the soviet union mixed into this plot is a soviet defector kgb general koskov jeroen krabb bond 's mission was to get koskov out of east germany and into berlin however it appears that someone wants koskov dead as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill koskov as he attempts to defect bond has a chance to kill kara milovy well played by maryam d'abo but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead the plot thickens during the debrief of koskov koskov tells british agents that general leonid pushkin played by always excellent actor john is executing a program to eliminate britain 's secret agents unfortunately kgb appears to retrieve koskov from the english estate safe house and the british agents are unable to learn more bond turns to kara milovy bond leads kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet koskov her patron however bond has yet to learn where koskov is what follows is an movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end there is an excellent battle scene in afghanistan filmed in morocco and an even better escape scene from afghanistan after all that action there remains one loose end to tie up which bond does nicely during the film we meet another excellent supporting actor art malik as kamran shah an afghani chief we also meet joe don baker as brad whitaker there is yet another version of felix leiter this time a less than memorable version of leiter caroline bliss is a mediocre version of miss moneypenny the special effects were much more versus those in a view to a kill '' the ubiquitous returns with rockets rocket boost outriggers and sundry other gadgets there is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin the same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool this film also featured exploding milk bottles the way koskov escapes from east germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons including the use of a harrier vertical takeoff jet in general the special effects were well done and believable there are a few moments where i noticed some scene glitches it appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the bond was flying had two engines in another scene in the plane bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank however the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window perhaps bond also has eyes in yet another scene kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the which is impossible due to the configuration of the 's ramps however these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent the special edition dvd includes a deleted scene where bond rides a flying carpet i will leave you to discover how that stunt was performed the reason given for its deletion was the length of the movie keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song sings living daylights '' was popular in europe at the time and had a huge hit in the united states with take on me '' there is irony in that the james bond films are filmed in the same country that is the origin of who one could start to think that james bond is like who incarnating as different people over time timothy dalton was the fourth official '' bond each of the bonds has had their own style and abilities and each have generally been well exploited fortunately for viewers timothy dalton 's bond was a more austere bond living up to the tradition of the ian fleming novels he was smart athletic and confident without being arrogant this bond movie remains above average for the genre and enjoyable to watch multiple times
this movie is really funny and vince vaughan is just great in it it is good to watch when you need to laugh
i did n't watch this one before because of all the hype too many buddy comedies were coming through the pipe this one caught me by surprise it really was first rate two dudes who 're crashing weddings so they 'll always have a date party animals with very rigid rules break it off before sunrise commitment 's just for fools until one day one falls in love the other falls in lust if you want to see vince vaughn get hurt then this one is a must sometimes sappy sometimes sweet and often lewd and loud but it does n't stoop to flatulence so it stands out from the crowd amanda richards november 5 2006
wedding crashers '' starts off slow i thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie but i was wrong by the end the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch yeah this movie is overhyped a little but it is still a really good movie vince vaughn and owen wilson are raally great in their roles on this film it 's not a film you have to really think about it is just a good comedy
john and jeremy party hearty crashing weddings until of course the inevitable happens they fall in love themselves i watched this flick while planning my wedding and enjoyed it so much i 've been tempted to try it kind of sorry nobody crashed mine ! great romantic comedy the added features which include chaz ' rules of wedding crashing make this dvd well worth the buy
the opening sequence with dwight yokum and rebecca de mornay is one of the funniest in the film the rest does n't live quite up to it the movie suffers from an improbability problem i know from working weddings like some they went to it 's not easy to sneak into a wedding especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite ! besides that i will say i enjoyed the film it 's not as funny as say 40 year old virgin but there 's some good stuff in there keir o'donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the son of walken these were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film owen wilson is very likable in the film as the with his age and wanting more out of life he more or less plays the straight man to vince vaughn 's antics vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie funny and good but at times i was left scratching my head he 's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie the directing by dobkin sometimes feels less than good desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these buddies '' looking a bit too disconnected bottom line if you enjoy comedies especially of this genre see it it is very formulatic and if you 're smart you 'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy over 2 hours ps will ferrell turns in a very odd performance as chazz reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher you might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character
the wedding crashers is one of the modern breed of along with hitch that actually appeals to men as well as women the formula is simple amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star it basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half i enjoyed it but it does get a bit sappy towards the end
this video gives straight forward and useful information on shooting digital photography in various sports settings i found it very useful
i have many books about digital sports photography and they do n't even come close to this dvd in regard to practical application the title of this dvd is so on target it is 'simple ' to use the settings suggested and it pays off immediately this is an excellent dvd and well worth the cost i wish the same people made one about digital portrait photography to all parents of athletes buy this dvd only buy the books if you want to go into professional sports photography
teaching photography i have seen quite a few videos and this one is the best so far it is well and produced it takes the view point of an amateur photographer mom dad photographing the kids playing various sports but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals equipment wise he does expect a digital slr with a minimum of a lens sorry no allowed otherwise i would highly recommend this video
i 'm new to using an slr and this dvd was the perfect training video this video tells you what equipment you need how to set it up where to position yourself and how to shoot for the best results with my new camera and this information i immediately was able to produce good shots during basketball and baseball games well worth the money
of all the instruction and training i 've received over the years i thought this was one of the best if not the best instructional dvds i 've ever seen doug jensen has really set the bar every aspect of it was extremely well done scripting structure use of stills and video video camera work i 'm a video producer myself so i paid particular attention to that audio often a weak point in dvds and the use of graphics i really liked the 'through the viewfinder ' parts where sports action video is shown framed in a slr viewfinder even the glossary was helpful in reviewing terms and also the explanation of the digital photo histogram plus it was loaded with tons of practical tips and advice the kind of things that a really experienced photographer tells you when they want to help you out for someone like me who is transitioning from a film slr to digital slr it was really helpful to clarify the concept of ev exposure value and the interplay of iso shutter and aperture yeah i knew what they were but to see the relationship in action '' and how it changes from shutter priority to aperture priority depending on the shot really reinforced the concepts if you buy only one resource for digital sports photography this should be it it has a permanent place in my dvd reference library
i love this movie it came out a couple of years after i personally had some what of the same experiences i had a baby when i was 15 and my boyfriend and i split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later married at 17 so unlike what 'rochelle o'gorman ' says who gave the editorial review on this movie teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality i think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young
for when you need a little molly ringwald fix that 16 candles just wo n't satisfy fantastic !
i am molly ringwald 's fan i have two laserdisc of for keeps 1988 new and used i love it much thats why i bought it on dvd too you wo n't regret it
i have always loved this movie too me it is a comfort movie because i have seen it so many times growing up i recently let my 13 year old neice watch it and she loved it too i didnt think she would like it that much because its a big time 80 's flick but she loved it now she wants to watch it everytime she comes over
molly ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant she and the father get married and try to stick it out she tries to work while pregnant he tries to help his dad out nothing seems to work they get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother which is difficult for everyone molly 's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he 's willing to give it up to help her with the baby but she does n't want him to in the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does mixed in with the humor and comedy there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young it 's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from
this is really one of my favorite molly ringwald movies of course all of them great this one stands out a lil more its a more serious role of something thats happening everyday i was also excited this came to dvd give her alot of props for this one
for keeps where shall i start for keeps is one of those 80 's movies that would fit perfect on the lifetime network molly ringwald stars as darci elliot and randall batinkoff stars as stan bobrutz intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name it is the butt of several jokes in the film the two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when darci becomes pregnant they struggle to stay together i think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture it is not one of those happily ever after stories stan and darci go through some real hard times the movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with darci pushing stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge but the movie will entertain those in grade and up its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80 's fan building their collection
i love this movie and i was so worried it would never get to dvd since not many people have even heard of it its one of those movies that you can watch in your pj 's over and over i just think of it as a comfort movie i 'm sure plenty of people would think thats crazy but i really like it
i 've been a mr show fan for decades i saw bob and david not dave in concert in twin falls idaho back in 1989. they were a bit raw but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony some people want to call them the next bob ray or rowan martin or even i say peeshaw ! bob has more talent in his ankle left than all of those jerks combined and for david not dave he 's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by hpv i hope lifetime will listen to its viewers and bring this back
i had never watched show up until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on tbs slightly edited i was hooked and began recording every episode on tivo until i realized they seemed to be edited so i picked up the season and loved it there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing my favorite being the story of everest i finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times and while i found myself laughing out loud often i did n't find this to be as clever or funny as the season aside from one or 2 sketches not too much really stick out like the majority of season four a must own if you 're a true fan of the show for the commentary alone
show simply put funniest most intelligent skit show of all time david cross has performed stand up in more than comedy clubs entertaining more that people across the world bod odenkieriertkko is snl 's grammy winning writer nuff said
it could be argued that the brilliant and equally bizarre mr show had a very limited niche appeal although i 'm unsure as to why exactly well that 's not entirely true as i have a pretty good idea of why that is or was maybe the explanation lies within the inherent properties of average tv audiences being well why even delve into it eh allow me to slather on high praise i miss bob and dave bob was recently doing some thing on sundance channel in fact it was there that i saw the movie he directed melvin goes to dinner '' which i enjoyed but i digress mr show was original intelligent hysterical thank your lucky stars that the goodness of mr show 's hijinks have been preserved in this format for you to enjoy whenever the mood strikes you break this dvd out at a party and silently muse over the obtuse faces y'all are truly brutalizin ' me
this is the fourth time i have watched this first and second season of show and i must admit it is one of those rare programs that continues to get funnier and funnier each time that you watch it literally you catch something new and fresh each time it is placed inside of your dvd player what makes this series work better than most other television comedies out there is the chemistry of the cast bob odenkirk and david cross are perfectly matched while also being completely random choices for the hosts of the show i had not heard about either of them before watching this series which i bought due to a recommendation from a friend now i have watched melvin goes to dinner several times and listened to david cross ' comedy whenever i need a very social ! needless to say i have full submersed myself into their world after watching this groundbreaking series what continues to work with this program is that the jokes are not your typical slapstick humor that the average joe '' can get from watching reruns of friends on nbc show is hard hitting in your face political yet not so political social satire about the world around us while you may just see this as just another comedy show i see it as so much more the cohesiveness of the skits and the underlying message throughout each show seem to represent the voices that we hear coming from our local papers on a daily basis they are not afraid to take a delicate issue and twist it into a hysterical moment the brutal honesty of david cross makes this show thoroughly enjoyable while the approachable bob odenkirk brings it to our level also the interweaving of comic geniuses throughout the show keeps you wanting more jack black is a regular on the program and really proves why he is funny and there are appearances by dave foley sarah silverman jeanne tripplehorn patton oswalt julia sweeney janeane garofalo ben stiller conan o'brien and andy richter this is not a show for everyone but it does showcase the beauty of hbo and the ability that they have to see and go forward with comedy my favorite episodes were the news report featured in the extras operation hell on earth and if you 're going to write a comedy scene you 're going to have some rat feces in there and the infamous milk machine joke song with jack black ! utterly hysterical no pun intended this dvd set of the first and second seasons is packaged very well with every season uncensored were they ever with hbo you get show as it should be and will always be remembered it also is chalked full of extras that will quench every drop of show that resides in you the news report that they do in the extras portion of this dvd is worth buying alone again it shows the creativity and originality of a program that knew no boundaries i can not wait to get my hands on the other seasons and fully explore the world in which i live which is the world showcased continually on show the absurdity of our culture is redefined with this program grade out of
i started watching mr show on hbo in it 's season on hbo and loved it i ran accross the dvd for seasons 1 2 together and in a fit of nostalgia decided to get it it was on of the best dvd purchases i 've ever made these men are geniuses although not everybody gets their brand of comedy it was fun seeing jack black on one of the early episodes as well
i had been aware that once there was a show called show '' starring bob and david and that it had been on hbo but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend when the power of satan um compelled me to pick up the first two seasons all i got ta say is praise satan for leading me to this glory ! the first season comprised of four episodes is fantastic with flashes of brilliance on the gay porno video '' but it 's the second season that really will make you a fan such oddities as woodycooks only the british can fly comedy writers the iguana and jeepers creepers unleash the funny like you 'd never believe show proves that there is a market for intelligent hilarious sketch comedy on cable or in the case of kith and monty python imported from other countries but show is homegrown it 's comedy at a breakneck speed and there 's never a dull moment in either season you 'll laugh you 'll cry you 'll learn how to fight crime with a crime stick '' and ice cream and enjoy products while your business goes to hell led by a red balloon the security guard and i shared something in common me !
this comedy volume is absolutely great while i 'm a fan of the series i thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next definately do n't watch season 3 before seeing these seasons because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree it does n't move as fast as some comedy out there but it all fits together better than most of what is on tv today
my favorite movie is the diary of anne frank 1959 why this is a movie about a 13 year old girl and her family that hides with her family and 4 other people in amsterdam the netherlands to escape from the nazis during world war 2 because they are jewish the characters consists of frank frank their daughters margot and anne then there are the van daans and their son peter also there is a crabby old dentist and they have the helpers kraler and miep they help the people in the secret annex get food and clothing later in the movie anne falls in love with peter the van daans ' son they tell each other everything at the end peter and anne kiss a couple of times and everybody is arrested and taken to conceratiain camps frank is the only survivor
read the to see the movie this item hardly needs my review it is and always be one the greatist stories ever told
restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length including overture and exit music george stevens ' cinemascope production of the diary of anne frank 1959 fox is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience frances goodrich and albert hackett adapted their broadway show with a brilliant joseph schildkraut otto frank and gusti huber frank repeating their stage roles added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young millie perkins as anne oscar winner shelley winters oscar nominee ed wynn in a bitter dramatic role diane baker and richard beymer as anne 's boy friend it is heartrending material a german jewish family hiding out from the nazis for two years in a dutch attic with anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the nazis and has become one of the most important holocaust documents maybe the same god who unforgivably let anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war 's end helped hide her diary for posterity location filming was done in the actual amsterdam attic with the real otto frank as technical advisor the b w art direction the actual two story attic interior to perfection on huge fox sound stages and cinematographer william mellor peyton place worked miracles to make wide cinemascope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic stevens gives it all a tension even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device bonus material is outstanding a documentary echoes from the past '' new interviews with george stevens who was director in amsterdam and a 66 year old millie perkins and movietone newsreel footage you will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight oscars the same year as some like it hot north by northwest and anatomy of a murder that was some movie year ! diary of anne frank is an unforgettable holocaust drama and movie experience when you have a three hour time slot
detached as i am when watching movies this one truly grabbed my heart and never stopped squeezing the juice pouring out of my eyes in the form of sympathetic tears this movie is great in all departments acting writing directing and editing based on some of the previous reviews i expected an amaturish performance from millie perkins no way she was wonderful expressing the gamut of teenage emotions and evoking from me a caring understanding response her only weakness is in her narration it 's a bit stiff never transcending the sense of someone reading rather than just talking naturally but this this is greatly overshadowed by the subtleties of her acting which absorbed me thoroughly this is a movie worth seeing many times so absorbing is the story and the characters
this is a beautiful and very touching dramatization about a gifted young german jewish girl whose family had to go into hiding in order to avoid being captured and killed by the nazis the characters of miep gies and kraler otto frank 's who hid the family at this horrible time and place are very very positive as well the film stars millie perkins anne frank richard beymer as peter van daan ed wynn dussel and shelley winters van daan who won an award for this as best supporting actress all were absolutely brilliant the film is a work of art that won several academy awards i can not recommend highly enough this remarkable and brilliant work as positive and human as anne herself
while millions of unfortunate people were marched off to nazi death camps during world war ii the franks and the van daans savored their moment in hiding until they were discovered in august 1944 after an informer had tipped off the ss millie perkins played the title role of anne frank a girl in her teens who wished for a happy life and did her best to bring happiness to her family during a tumultuous time in the course of history in the two years the eight people were cooped up in a secret hideout on the top floor of a building located in the heart of amsterdam anne kept up with her education and had the dream of one day to become a writer she began writing a diary of her daily experiences of what she learned in life and how she coped with the boredom while in hiding she had a courtship with peter van daan as their relationship grew stronger toward the end when the ss broke through the secret entrance arresting all eight people anne died of typhus within two months of nazi germany 's surrender while interned at the infamous death camp her father otto was the only one of the eight to survive the holocaust returning to the former hideout where he found his daughter 's diary to have it published he resided in canada until his death in the i visited the anne frank museum in amsterdam during the summer of 1977 before seeing this film for the first time the following year seeing the layout of the actual hiding place i could picture how everything was while watching the film though a part of history reflecting back to that dark era is painful for some people who had experienced the holocaust and nazi persecutions someone once said of the nazi era that it is the things we want to forget most that we try the hardest to remember
is a very interesting adaptation of this famous diary that shows the life of anne and her family when they were hide from nazis on wwii i recommend it canadian and mexican customers be careful neither spanish or french audio tracks were included but you can select the subtitles
for those of you who may be reluctant to buy this because of the specifications listed on the back of the box let me set your mind at ease while the box states widescreen format aspect ratio it is actually anamorphically enhanced and even though it states english stereo it is actually dolby digital 4.0 there is no english mono or spanish and french language tracks and the commentary track includes millie perkins even though she 's not listed the movie looks beautiful and sounds great
my new year 's resolution was to see a bunch of movies i 'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss somewhat belatedly i 'm fulfilling my resolution which is why i finally saw westworld although it was somewhat dated i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this the film concerns delos a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion guests engage in orgiastic sex feasting and heavy drinking and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it one can choose between doing this in roman world medieval world or westworld the film focuses primarily on two visitors to westworld played by richard benjamin and james brolin this was one of the last films made before the onset of the personal computer yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it according to one book i recently read the cgi representing the vision field of the the gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history so in this way it could be considered cutting edge on the other hand when things start going wrong with a number of the robots the head of technology on delos describes the ailment as a disease '' today we 'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software westworld '' is clearly the stock warner brothers western set that was used at approximately the same time by blazing saddles this works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar though understandably familiar since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes so the visitors to the park get pretty much the western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect even the bad guys seem familiar yul bryner for instance wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in the magnificent seven the visitors quickly fall into the routine james brolin doing an obvious imitation of clint eastwood and richard benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer they visit the local brothel kill the robot played by yul bryner a couple of times get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl then things go wrong on a major scale with the robots going on a killing spree the highpoint of the film is the long chase of richard benjamin by yul bryner a remake of westworld is currently in development i am normally opposed to remakes for the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals even in the case of most films the remakes of the invasion of the body snatchers were inferior to the original while the original planet of the apes is vastly superior to the remake but this is one instance where if done correctly a remake could improve upon the original the film is well done but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life as a result the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive for instance there are no keyboards but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs the danger of course is going overboard with the special effects the temptation all too often is to go overboard with cgi and spectacular effects in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle my hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum all in all this was a very enjoyable and different film it was directed and written by michael crichton and i could n't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another crichton creation jurassaic park both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most entertainment welcome to delos vacation spot of the future where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true you may choose westworld romanworld and meadevilworld ! you can for 1000.00 a day 1974 prices you can live out your most secert 's all set up to please you and you ca n't get hurt of course if that were true then we have no movie soon after the latest batch of people get to the park the robots begin to have breakdowns like a virus i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as to far out there no one will believe it '' wonder if they still think so james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest the final chase with evil robot yul brynner still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad a very fun movie
a bit campy in spots a bit ahead of its time in others westworld looms as a potential goldmine for hollywood introduce an cast at the beginning split them up to the three different worlds and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate only to find themselves in medieval world repeat formula for the second part adding in the characters who went off to that park then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at roman world for the big third film finale seriously why is somebody not making this already
i watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night she was into it with her short attention span for the whole film one pleasant surprise it has a pretty good chase scene i like chase scenes any sf fan will welcome this in collection a few good comic shots watch richard benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the jail break
it was a great movie if there were such a place as west world i would enjoy taking a vacation over there i know i would have a great time i am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real it was a movie worth buying
in the future there is a special adult themepark called delos '' which has three different area adventure worlds which are medieval world '' west world '' and roman world '' where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember two vacationers richard benjamin and james brolin has chosen westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there 's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot yul bryner who wants to kill them amusing and fascinating thriller written and directed by the author of jurassic park '' michael crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it 's time yul bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on the terminator '' this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting wars movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the simpsons called itchy and scratchy land '' the dvd has decent picture sound with only one extras which is the original trailer but still this is a must have for anyone who likes also recommended jurassic park terminator 1 2 blade runner tron robocop i robot and chopping mall

'boogie nights ' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'nashville ' did to country music it shows the underside of the glamour presented the film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the high life '' then pulls the rug out from under it we see the usual suspects and the usual draws there 's money fame lust passion and drugs but these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore the seemingly long drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists it is superficial and all of life 's best elements seem to go out the window there is the calculated cheesiness of the producer burt reynolds and his odd detatchment from his craft he both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him he meets a young aspiring hopeful mark wallberg who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home his naivete ' is striking and he does n't entirely change in his innocence only becoming a casualty of it the way he practices to become the next bruce lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life his new success does n't make him all that happy including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate the aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone except the calloused producer a casualty in a different way one fellow porn star don cheadle demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a business but the decent conventional world wo n't let him similarly a fellow porn creator william macy shows tragically that love transcends lust even when it wo n't ever become realized a female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle if we are n't convinced near the end of the movie then a candid camera '' scene between rollergirl '' and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry 's false promises for true happiness the initial draw to 'boogie nights ' may be deceptive it presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness
this is a movie loosely based on 70 's and 80 's porn star john holmes in this version a young man name eddie adams is approached by porn director jack horner eddie then turns famouse and leads into a downward spiral including drugs and violence this movie features many stars of the late 90 's and today including mark wahlberg as eddie adams burt reynolds at jack horner john reilly as reid rothchild and julianne moore as amber waves burt reynolds and julianne moore were nominated for oscars for their breakthrough performance this movie was also nominated for best writing to paul thomas anderson for an oscar the extras on this dvd are good 10 deleted scenes a music video 2 commentary tracks and the john reilly files
a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast great performances great story just a great film unique approach to the subject characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion characters played by julianne moore don cheadle heather graham william macy and burt reynolds respectfully are great to watch this is a performance piece
given that pornography is a business it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams a almost impossibly teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 boogie nights is both a story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was paul thomas anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry with anderson pulling out every trick in the book long tracking shots underwater closeups montages views and some moments that approach dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example naturally anderson also loads the movie up with period details right down to the farah fawcett poster in teenage dirk 's room the platform shoes and the obligatory disco sequences its visual flair aside though boogie nights is also the sort of insanely quotable movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties trainspotting fargo goodfellas swingers true romance etc etc etc but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade this movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it especially its murderer 's row of a cast burt reynolds jack horner don cheadle buck swope john reilly reed rothchild julianne moore amber waves william macy little bill luis guzman maurice rodriguez tom jane todd parker philip baker hall floyd gondolli philip seymour hoffman scotty jay and alfred molina rahad jackson all figure prominently and even wahlberg dirk himself and heather graham rollergirl have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors that said what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like the main characters almost entirely have hopes aspirations and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker dirk 's ridiculous and reed 's equally ridiculous poetry buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her helping us see them as characters not just plot devices in the story since there is n't really a plot to speak of the movie is told as a series of episodes with several extended pieces the pool party at jack 's house where gets introduced to the whole crew the new year 's eve party celebrating the start of the 's the fake drug deal gone bad at a rahad 's house serving to turn the narrative in new directions this last set piece when dirk reed and todd head over to rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt deserves special mention as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory it starts off almost surreal with a skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and rahad clad only in underwear a bathrobe and slippers discoursing as he sings along to 80 's songs on a mixtape from there it just gets progressively darker and tenser with the lighting acting and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as todd kicks his robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control molina 's performance more than anything else makes the scene as he turns rahad into a manic ball of energy and later a avenging angel determined to take his revenge i would n't say molina turns in the best performance i 've ever seen in a movie but it it probably the best performance i 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie the 's are of course the hangover from the joys of the previous decade as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product cocaine suddenly becomes addictive and dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one fittingly as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties the movie takes a darker turn becoming grittier more downcast and a lot more violent but no less compelling all the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present just in a decidedly less sunny form even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right the movie 's pacing makes it all but impossible to look away well except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end but by then i for one did n't care
yes my mock amazon name is dirk diggler long story but this is boogie nights '' i ca n't say this movie was '' because it was n't in fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is '' burt reynolds is back at the top of his game in years marky mark can act dirk himself heather graham and all the rest are in top form what can you say kinda a mock story of john 's porn scene but you really start to care about these people soundtrack represents the time and it all just works i ca n't hear sister christian '' by nightranger without thinking of that scene some of you know others will get the new line 2 disc version it 's impressive if you have an open mind and can take it for what it is this will become a favorite i guarentee it
i was very impressed with this story i saw it in the theater and also have this version on dvd this is one of the most intense longest fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70 's and 80 's very stylistic and un believable a c ockumentary of superior proportions but it was n't really a documentary just a hollywood movie based on a time when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd when i say un believable i mean the story truely is unbelievable in that the porn industry is not a man actor 's world but clearly belongs to the female actor she is the star in this industry so when i see a movie like this i worry for the young men out there who think that they are the next dirk diggler '' while i 'm probably over worrying the concept i still hope that my words reach some man out there this is not reality this is a fantasy conceptualized by a hollywood director and nothing more in reality this could have easily been a story written about a female actress such as rollergirl interesting enough the director fell into the cliche making rollergirl a victim chastised by her highschool classmates and ran out of school but in reality we in the know know that it is the jenna jameson 's and tera patrick 's who are the real starts i give this one 5 stars though as it really is an over the top effort by the director i was quite impressed two hard ones up ! this movie rocks ! mc white said check it out ! !
one word interesting and for the ending very interesting i was a bit iffy about this movie before i watch it but it was actually a good
boogie nights is one of those films in the vein of blow fear and loathing in las vegas requiem for a dream that stares unflinchingly at something ugly and asks us to follow along without blinking when it 's the porn industry it 's hard not to blink it 's the swinging and porn is on the rise eddie adams aka dirk diggler mark wahlberg is a lad with a particular gift that gift happens to be in his pants his reputation is well known but it 's only when porn director jack horner burt reynolds discovers him that dirk 's career takes off and thus begins a bizarre journey into the seedier side of filmmaking complete with antics arguments about video technology and lots of sex and drugs what 's alternately curious and interesting about the film is that this is a traditional rag to riches story only it happens to involve porn dirk is portrayed as having a natural talent a trait every character observes with deadly seriousness his talent and the dedication to his art '' elevates the entire porn industry itself from merely badly filmed sex films to dramas with plot and character development well what passes for character development in porn anyway there 's amber waves julianne moore a porn queen barred from seeing her own children and subsequently mother to everybody reed rothschild john reilly is dirk 's man and frequent rollergirl heather graham in her best acting role yet does it with her roller skates on all the time buck swope don cheadle is a black porn star that wants to live the american dream of owning his own business and finally we have little bill william macy assistant director to horner and married to a utterly hedonistic woman who does it with everyone everywhere at any time by the time we get to the several characters are dead video is king and dirk is too hopped up on drugs to notice that it 's affecting his performance a falling out with horner leads dirk to strike out on his own trying to be anything but a porn star unfortunately dirk 's only good at one thing and it takes him most of the movie to figure out what that is horner waves and dirk creates their own twisted happy family incapable of living in society separately due to the stigma of what they do they form a kinship that only they can share and even they have their own bonds and boundaries to their work to themselves to each other those that can not define who they are end up dead or in prison or worse in the end boogie nights is about making good with what you 've got and yes that means even porn stars sometimes have to face facts sometimes you 're best talent is having sex on camera the question becomes what a kid turned porn star is supposed to do about it boogie nights answers it in the final scene when the true star of the film is unzipped to stare us in the face
well there 's nothing i can add to this spectacular dvd excellent concert that you should n't
upon my viewing of zoo tv live in sydney '' at the tender age of ten it is secure to articulate that i was most enamored with now being years of age this particular show still draws me despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews are unquestionably at their best that is not to declare that attained their peak during the zoo tv tour quite the contrary for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary after it was announced that zoo tv should finally be released onto dvd a fan such as i could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste i highly recommend this product
this title was actually one of the first dvds announced for the dvd format back in 1997. if you can find an old copy of four weddings and a funeral '' or other polygram dvds of that era in their unique '' polycarbonate cases you can see a brief preview of what this dvd was supposed to be unfortunately polygram cancelled it shortly before it was supposed to be released and it has been the holy grail of fans for the past 9 years until it came out the best format this was available on was clv laserdisc with none of the bonus stuff
simply put 5 stars is not enough to describe this dvd i will spare all the details as they 've pretty much been written already just go get this thing now !
great concert i remember this tour for me is the best tour because visit the first time my country mexico
the 90 's quadrilogy of achtung baby zooropa the passengers released under that psuedonym and pop are the last daring albums of 's career this concert footage parodies not only 's celebrity but celebrity in general with banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage the band was mocking it 's own ubiquity sadly they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour
finally we get zoo tv on dvd great stuff great looking back on this tour brought back memories i think bono sounds pitchy and off key in most of this dvd not his best vocals by far but otherwise a great concert
well finally we 've reached the end of the yellow brick road '' and have ourselves a great dvd release with this awesome concert out of oz nov 1993. i love how this band still gives the fans what they want check that need lol and release great great great dvd 's of their live shows ! i mean i am a prince fan also not as much as i was was i was 14 and that guy has barely let out any of his spectacular concert shows ! syracuse '' sign o ' the times '' rave 2000 '' and now alladin live '' 's it out on vhs or dvd alladin '' rave '' were the only dvd releases well officially anyways could and would put out a live anthology boxed set if they wanted to and it would not have to be culled from any of their already released live releases ie zoomerang sydney '' popmart mexico city '' etc i mean the mind boggles at the possibilities ! but what has come out has been quality and quantity ! i mean they put out the fabulous chicago 2005 '' show last year same year it was recorded may ! and there is talk of another vertigo tour '' dvd forgot what show wan na say another mexico city this year too ! i mean we fans have it too damn good ! i know a forthcoming popmart '' dvd release is due probably next year and like this dvd they will put out a great transfer with fun bonus material and really capture the era '' it represented zoo tv '' and popmart '' are both my two favorite tours even though i never got myself to a concert until november 2001 and that was a transcendent experience ! same with vertigo in nov 2005 '' but that show was not to the high standard left by the big stadium tours these guys still deliver wait and be patient for red rocks 1983 '' too it will come out soon i think ! and when it does expect the same love and care given out by the men from ! ! !
incredible ! zoo tv 12 years on and still holding up strong imho achtung baby zoo tv was as revolutionary groundbreaking and mezmerizing to rock as the beatle 's sgt pepper was in the 60 's get this dvd
live from sydney is the first dvd release to actually take place long before the others done around the achtung era the dvd is missing a lot of those songs from pop to all that you ca n't leave behind and atomic bomb for some it 's great i mean how often can we see beautiful day and elevation on a dvd while others wish that certain songs were included or that the concert took place after a certain record zoo tv was just the precursor to the band 's popmart tour yet at the same time it 's great to see that spectacle aspect as usual with a dvd the set tends to be chockful of whatever album they were promoting not that achtung baby is a bad album in fact it 's my top album trumping the usual best album joshua tree only thing is though is that the set seems to be one achtung baby track after another great to see even better than the real thing while i wish wild horses was on however we get some great moments including a great unchained melody rendition lemon on dvd finally as well as love is blindness one disappointment is that there 's no all i want is you heartland i still have n't found bad and damnit put gloria for a change on the set of course anyone can go through an entire dvd and whine about what they missed or what they have n't written yet such as discotheque and hold me thrill me kiss me kill me where the show does shine though is there 's a true grandiose fashion to it all from car floodlights to a big remote control checking out soccer games to bono calling for a cab it 's a far cry from the relatively straightforward dvd 's of recent while it is missing a bit of those charismatic moments such as the boston dvd where he lay beside a girl on the stage or slane castle where he was practically in tears during kite but during love is blindness he actually held onto a fan for almost the entire song in macphisto makeup while it does n't have the power of boston or intimacy of slane castle it 's nonetheless a great portrait of rockers who were very daring and showmen at one point
first off '' the man in the moon '' is a great film ! with robert mulligan the director of 'to kill a mockingbird ' and 'the summer of 42 ' at the helm and a 14 year old reese witherspoon as dani who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time the film certainly starts out on the right foot in a nutshell a tale of 2 sisters some plot spoilers below its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural louisiana maureen trant 17 emily warfield and dani trant 14 reese witherspoon are sisters very close bonds hold them together but this summer will put a strain on their relationship the strain comes in the form of right appearing without warning as the boy next store his name is court foster jason london and he is 17 years old the trouble is dani saw him first or more correctly he saw her the family knows that dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy but owing to the age differences and the boy 's character nobody is worried except court he 's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around and perhaps more too much more ! then the plot thickens more plot spoilers below maureen never sees court until we 're about halfway through the summer since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the trants when she does see him he has come to their house to visit dani but then something happens court and maureen are obviously taken with each other and dani ca n't believe it how could her sister betray her like this from this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when right appears to both of them as the perfect man robert mulligan director sam waterston matthew trant tess harper abigail trant gail strickland marie foster reese witherspoon dani trant jason london court foster emily warfield maureen trant bentley mitchum billy saunders about the dvd excellent widescreen transfer special features theatrical trailer scene selections wish there were more bottom line this is a 'reel ' slice of life that wo n't disappoint this is quite a little story with a big punch the supporting roles are impeccably played with sam waterston playing matthew trant the father and tess harper playing abigail trant as the mother they have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in louisiana
i loved the setting of this movie it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds i enjoy hearing the pace was relaxed but not dull at all the plot was sweet the acting well done reese witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie her first major role
i loved this movie breathtaking scenery a simple yet enthralling story and wonderful acting all around no drugs no guns no violence a nice movie to watch on a rainy day
i love this little story of the relationship between two sisters the performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting it still gets me
i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoon 's portrayal of dani trant a tomboy in rural louisiana circa 1957. she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister maureen a now rarely seen emily warfield and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing then seventeen year old court foster jason london the son of her mother 's close friend gail strickland moves in next door dani experiences her first crush while court enjoys her company and willful spirit dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving dani behind the sisters ' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters ' individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film 's atmosphere of a simpler time a touching film with a timeless message
i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on it 's been some time now and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon a heartbreaking beautifully acted and film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore and it 's a shame
this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous to me movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september '' now who is this robert mulligan anyway lovable little gem
excellent movie seriously why ca n't they make more movies like this smart very dramatic exciting i could go on and on just a very satisfying movie of the thousand times i have watched it if i accidently come across it on tnt or hbo or wherever i have to sit and watch it until the end even though i have it on dvd right there on my bookshelf ! i ca n't walk away ! i love the beginning of the movie when they are boarding the sub and they are standing in the rain while hackman addresses the crew and he has that little q a routine with the chief of the boat george dzundza this scene really sets the tone it almost made me want to join the navy the battle between hackman and washington 's characters is of course what the movie is all about and they pull it off flawlessly very good work by both men that said all of the key charactors are interesting and the director really pulls this movie together very well despite the many charactors involved many of these guys are big stars now the great acting the very exciting story and edge of the seat drama just overwhelm whatever weaknesses or improbabilities that may exist in this movie great stuff
this is a simply amazing movie and what makes it even more stellar is that we 've had several fantastic submarine movies in the past das boot and red october come to mind we 've already seen the claustrophobic booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine that this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning is rather impressive we begin with two powerhouses of actors gene hackman and denzel washington gene is in charge of the sub denzel works for him gene is an unabashed alpha male not unheard of in a commander denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command suddenly we 're thrown into a situation where the sub have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the us unfortunately the sub ca n't get confirmation so either they shoot and risk starting wwiii for no reason or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter the plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters there 's no right or wrong both scenarios are equally plausible gene wants to do what he was ordered to do to save as many lives as he can denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war both men suck up the men around them into their sides nobody wants the war gene does n't take pleasure in firing but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives in such close confines every person on screen makes a huge difference this movie had not only two stellar top men but also a fantastic supporting cast james gandolfini a la sopranos viggo mortensen a la lord of the rings the music from hans zimmer is just amazing he is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works if i had to find something to in this movie it 's that i do n't think the sub scenes were truly realistic '' it seemed more of a hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months i think das boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across but really the sub in this case was a set '' for the dialogue and character development to happen in it was n't the showcase and this was n't a sub documentary so i 'm willing to accept that tradeoff so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got
the very best war movies resonate with viewers not just because of top flight acting but because there is always a subtext present that demands that viewers think as well as view in crimson tide director tony scott allows the events on the uss alabama a nuclear submarine to force viewers to confront some truly ugly but inevitable revelations that in some dicey situations there are no good versus bad guys just decent men who demand that events follow their own unique perceptions of those events gene hackman is captain ramsey a tough nuclear sub skipper who has just received an order to launch his sub 's missles at russia which has just discovered that one of its military bases has been taken over by a rogue general who is determined to launch his missles at america just after ramsey receives his order to launch the needed verfication to launch does not arrive due to an unexpected underwater confrontation with a russian sub the alabama 's radio is damaged should ramsey launch anyway on the premise that to delay can lead only to the certainty that the russians will get the first blow in his xo lieutenant commander turner denzel washington does not think so both believe that the other is totally wrong turner leads a mutiny to prevent the launch crimson tide is a claustrophobic testosterone filled plunge into the icy waters of duty versus rationality hackman injects his role with the total believability of ruthlessness that has come to mark his essential film persona he can slug washington in the face in one scene to enforce his decision to launch then in the very next scene can placidly discuss horse breeding with the same man with the same believability crimson tide is a film of men under stress with some handling it better than others george dzundza has a powerful supporting role as the head of security who is forced by circumstances to back washington whom he believes to be in the right over ramsey a captain whom he greatly respects but believes to be in the wrong when ramsey regains control dzundza grudgingly admits half of me is glad that he did '' and that right there is the compelling subtext of the movie that events force both actor and viewer to decide whether unfolding events ought to fill us with fear that one or the other side may be in the right but never knowing which is which crimson tide is a terrific film that requires the viewer to face such a choice whether he wants to or not
oh ya forget navy subs well the russian military is better and russian army better they can beat usa
this movie was good though there were many innacuracies as to what really goes on inside a nuclear sub that aside it is very good
when this movie came out in 1995 i caught it in the theatre and enjoyed it so much i bought the video tape and just to let you know the hunt for red october video tape also ! but i digress gang it appears that a unrated '' version of crimson tide '' is coming out on dvd unrated '' what could they possible put on the dvd to make it unrated the scheduled release date is if i can equate unrated version special edition '' then i 'm in for my copy ! great movie four stars ! !
take a solid script about nuclear warfare puff it up with quentin tarantino style cram it all into a submarine called the alabama throw in the legendary gene hackman and future legend denzel washington and what do you get crimson tide '' one of the best military flicks i 've ever seen chock full of emotion intensity and suspense crimson tide '' takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of life death and warfare on a nuclear naval submarine hackman is the captain of the alabama a sub destined to launch nuclear missiles on russia in a last ditch attempt to suppress rebel forces in that country denzel washington is the handpicked xo that is forced to make a terrible decision during an undersea battle with rebel forces an emergency message is lost during transmission was the message sent to stop plans to fire the nuclear missiles or to go ahead with the plans hackman insists he go ahead with his original orders to launch the nukes washington stands against him and has the captain sent to his quarters all of this is done by the book what results is a mutiny by the captain in an attempt to regain control of his sub and continue his original mission full of intense sequences involving life and death situations this film left me exhausted by the constant decisions made and the timing of each event hackman and washington were superb in their roles each conveyed the emotion and allegiance of their respective characters flawlessly but the list of excellent actors does n't stop there viggo mortensen of lord of the rings '' and hidalgo '' fame plays webster he 's washington 's friend and a loyal officer on the ship who literally holds the fate of the world in his hands steve zahn saving silverman '' daddy daycare '' happy texas '' is solid in a supporting role former child star rick schroder also appears in a brief but moving role danny nucci titanic '' plays an officer who stands for what he believes is right james gandolfini the sopranos '' is also here in a wonderfully sinister role as hackman 's loyal shipmate oh and do n't forget to throw in ryan phillipe i know what you did last summer '' cruel intentions '' who has a miniscule role but does well none the less there are other faces in the crowd who have n't achieved as much fame but you 'll recognize them from smaller roles in other films for instance george dzundza who 's been in a ton of films but never a star and scott grimes who i only knew was in this film when i saw the credits role you may recognize grimes ' name from critters '' in short this motion picture has a very capable cast of performers future stars and minor players who fill out the plot exceptionally well highly recommended to fans of claustrophobic cinema such as the hunt for red october '' and naval stories in general also fans of intense drama will definitely enjoy this film
three jocular guys get on stage and do a lampoon homage to the classics while breaking down the fourth wall like a wrecking ball the beastie boys nope it 's the reduced shakespeare company they break character break the play argue about the direction of the play like kids in a game toss insults and interact the audience they even do a long spoof on pretentious acting workshops as they prepare a dragged up audience member to say her line actually she just has to scream but it 's a good one with subtext ! SMILE throughout the show the trio 's what next '' anarchy is more entertaining than their condensed versions of plays for bard vets this disc may your ideas about the plays for kids and beginners it may inspire it 's obvious that the reduced players mastered shakespeare before they broke it down for people who read prescribed shakespeare as a chore with mtv on and never looked back like me the show 's '' lack of respect '' will entertain in short the reduced posse has something for everyone it may even be better than reading macbeth cliffs notes with the beastie boys cranked up to 11 maybe if you wan na know the real deal about the three well let me tell you we 're triple trouble y'all we 're gon na bring you up to speed check it out ! '' beastie boys get your learn on
there are a few moments in the play that thankfully my younger children did n't seem to get but i would n't have missed their acting it out afterwards for all the money in the world ! one reviewer wrote that it helps to have a knowledge of shakespeare before watching and i agree to an extent that does make it funnier when they combine the titles of the comedies however i also feel that someone unfamiliar will want to become familiar after watching this group play with the material so easily fantastic and refreshing !
and yes while it is helpful to know your shakespeare team francis bacon it is not necessary to have more than a passing recollection of the tediousness of it that was foisted off onto you in high school to find this comedy troupe a laugh riot with all the 100 budget drivel coming out of hollywood in the last decade it was really nice just to be able to sit back and enjoy something chock full of talent and mirth
this is a hilarious play taped for tv viewing i have seen the original and on second viewing it was equally funny while it may help to know some shakespeare there is so much slapstick and other humour that the whole family will laugh
this is one of the funniest dvds i have ever seen ! you can watch it over and over again and its still just as funny definately a must for any video collection
this show on stage or on dvd never ceases to amaze me i enjoyed watching it and it never gets old some slight understanding of shakespeare helps to understand the humor but overall i thought it was awesome definitely worth the money
these guys are terrific ! i 'm a student of shakespeare so every time i read a play i have n't read before i pull out this dvd to see what they 've done to it ! after reading coriolanus i was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play was n't appropriate for children if you love shakespeare or are just curious about shakespeare buy this dvd
jeeezeee it was a good break from the normal junk that get 's put out these guys are genuinly funny and it shows on stage purchase if you want a good laugh you do n't even have to understand a word or a line or know anything about shakespeare to enjoy this ! !
this movie is still as good today as it has always been i had the original on vhs but decided to get the dvd because i do n't have a video machine any more the only problem i have is that i was hoping for subtitles because the accent is a bit thick in places and i ca n't make out what they are saying i checked the spec and amazon says the dvd had subtitles but when i played the movie it said there was were no subtitles besides that no other issues with the dvd
scott neal and glen berry team up in this british film of two gay adolesents coming to terms with their sexuality and the pitfalls it entails i do n't know of a more tender sweet love story between two young males than beautiful thing '' the title says it all in the face of a cruel world predjudice society and family struggles these two lads find something beautiful and unique through each other that they never knew could possibly exist this is the perfect companion video to get real '' very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast if you like gay romance and coming of age films this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time
i did enjoy this film it had animated characters gay sexual tensions a bit of drama and a heartwarming ending 4 stars you know the story gay boy jamie falls for the hot boy next door ste is he gay is he straight find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath jamie makes the first move a very tense moment in any young mans life !
movies plays and books are all subjective endeavors the idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece in the case of beautiful thing that is not hard to do from the opening frame you want jamey to thrive he hates pe because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer the english call it football he jumps the fence and heads home skipping pe for the umpteenth time who can blame him and when a school chum 's ste 's homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn jamey 's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship as the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other the music of mama cass elliott plays in the background the story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple you know they are young but not too young you wish that had happened to you when you were their age earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story so i wo n't go into that here instead i want you to see the dvd so you can experience the feeling i felt at the end of the movie when jamey and ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood i chose to suspend my disbelief and each time i watch it i mouth the word yes ''
i have talked it over with a few of my friends and i have come to feel that there are certain films that are among the most important in queer cinema for any generation for the film i would have to call the important queer cinema film would be beautiful thing
a wonderful story about you young men that fall in love once you see it you want to own it and i did so i bought it ive seen it 4 times and will watch it many times more
i find this film very interesting though not for the reasons you would expect it 's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in london who one day discover they are attracted to each other one of them is not even aware that he might be gay ste the popular athlete put in this way it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story but it is much more than that and what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast they carry the weight of the story the character played by linda henry sandra jamie 's mother is truly fascinating and her performance is astounding and leah deserves a film just for herself also the soundtrack by mama cas and the mamas papas is a standout i think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film
this is a charming flick about two teenage boys who discover their love for one another after harrowing circumstances land them in the same apartment and eventually in the same bed
fortunitely way back when i got a hold of a vinyl album that spotlighted various tracks of comedic highlights from this show fortunitely this show plays on cable like i love lucy '' the opening duet and final piano play were both included on the vinyl album in entirety the show had many moments that could make the most solemn creature belt a good one because the situations were anything but they were newsworthy from pregnancy abortion homosexuality atheism religion politics and of course bigotry i read one article back when the show first premiered that a woman called her son long distance to make him tune in to all in the family '' so he could see how his deceased father was
it 's amazing to watch this television series and realize we live in an age where people seem to believe everything goes like same sex marriages freedom of just about everything including behavior yet many of the topics addressed with humor in this show are completely taboo on the regular channels it was funny during the 70 's and it 's still funny today
some classic episodes indeed all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households archie bunker 's old fashioned values were being challenged it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker 's views were organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970 's carol o'connor jean stapelton sally struthers and rob reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times all in the family spawned off may other great shows such as the jeffersons maude and indirectly good times this first season was certainly a reverred one just look at it with an open mind
if a company wants me to write a review in order to increase their sales they should pay me
this show rates as one of my favorites of all time in the genre of comedy it is my favorite show to date one of the great things about all in the family was its ability to take the viewer on a slice of life journey through the comedic irony and sometimes painful reality of life in my humble opinion carroll o'conner and jean stapleton were and are two of the greatest acting talents ever this dvd collection is very well done i highly recommend it to all
an excellent rendition of the show i saw on television i got to see the episodes i had missed
archie bunker is the funniest sitcom character in television history i own all five seasons and am eagerly awaiting the sixth of course like most sitcoms the humor of the first season does not have quite as much punch as the rest of them but i did about split my side on the very last episode of this season especially where archie says see review title
as usual archie has his crazy ideas of how the world works the races work women work and everything else that he 's made up or gathered from his brain or bigoted friends i love every minute of it ! i think i enjoy this show because if you look past the obvious you will learn a lesson episodes like judging books by covers '' explains that it 's not always the most obvious that are homosexual and just like anybody else they are people too so get over it in lionel moves into the neighborhood '' it is more than obvious that lionel has been coming into archie 's home for years but suddenly when a black family moves into the neighborhood archie realizes that he may have to bend more of his rules '' i am crazy about lionel 's tactics in dealing with archie and how archie ca n't seem to realize that lionel is making fun of him all the time the first and last supper '' was entertaining because this is when george jefferson gets to show that he is just as bad as archie by not showing up to dinner this was a brave show to put on television not because it showed a racist view we have plenty of those type of shows today but because all in the family '' makes fun of prejudice racism and sexism in a way that no show has done since
'amazon reviewers ' have already pointed out the dramatic change this show brought to com tv they have also indicated the specific episodes included here they have said something about archie and dingbat edith meatball and little sweet gloria my only addition is to point out how much pleasure this show brought to my own parents of blessed memory it was waited for and anticipated each week
perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done maxwell 's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable shaara 's novel provided a great resource and maxwell gave the visual display its magic the depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves duvall gave a performance expected of his talents lang provided the quintessential stonewall '' in all his intense humanity and passion in faith for the lover of history the detail is exceptional it may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time this is the film where you can admirers of stonewall '' will especially appreciate this film those unfamiliar with stonewall '' will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man his intensity still shines forth more than a century later it is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end in addition the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb i had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and i am very pleased with the result that has survived in this dvd edition it was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with stonewall
an almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film 's narrative as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern it is a dramatic technique at least as old as homer 's iliad and odyssey what gods and generals shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man 's nobility his rage and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine gods and generals sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout the director 's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers this nation 's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved it was bound to raise its head in a manner eventually the events of were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could true lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union 's preservation but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place the film follows the trajectory of general lee and more prominently virginia 's 'stonewall ' jackson the latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led not of himself but his grateful men would have it no other way 'stonewall jackson ' he would be from manassas on and 'stonewall ' he would die robert duvall stephen lang and jeff daniels do their characters proud though it is perhaps duvall 's general lee who most rings true to the man 's decency calm and painful array of allegiances mira sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the maine lieutenant coronel chamberlain 's wife fanny chamberlain 'war ' one of the characters is early heard to say 'is the sum of all evils ' and its reputed provocation by lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake ' the achievement of gods and generals is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men who at times find fratricide thrust upon them carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves this film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the american republic a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates staining its streets and drowning numbers of its finest
great movie great actors for such a sad part of the history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed especially stonewall '' jackson we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction but at the end of the day it 's not very important because the historical interest is preserved
i 'm not a civil war expert but having recently visited fredericksburg chancellorsville and gettysburg i paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books i read when i came home i watched both gettysburg and gods and generals again and i must say the events of these important battles come to life in these dvds yes there 's always going to be some interpretation done but overall i thought the acting was well done and the information reliable the characters were well developed as i felt that i got a chance to really know what these men were like if you want to see history then i would recommend this and gettysburg as well
when i got this dvd it was like i was there at the concert the sound is so good the band did an excelent job
reo still rocks and this concert proves that rock and roll is still alive with this power performance ! the band still has the youthful hunger of the early years ! lead kevin cronin 's voice still sounds great singing favorites like '' time for me to fly '' do n't let him go '' take it on the run '' keep on loving you '' ca n't fight this feeling anymore '' and so many others ! ! i love the lead guitar in reo dave amato ! ! awesome lead guitar gives reo a great edge ! i 've seen reo this summer in concert recently and saw how the audience including me just gravitated to the front of the stage and rocked the night away ! we all knew the songs and the place became a communal atmosphere that just does n't happen anymore with music luckily i happened to reach up and catch one of kevin cronin 's guitar picks which now has a framed presentation in my bedroom it was fun ! reo has brought back a better time for music and with this concert dvd i can relive it over and over do n't forget the special features which are interviews with kevin cronin and neal doughty love it and you will too
if you are from that deep purple foreigner rainbow whitesnake bad company era just go ahead and grab this one sound picture and the band sounds really tight
plus '' was brilliantly shot before an packed enthusiastic crowd in kansas city and shows the 5 guys of the current reo and how awesome performance musicians they are contains the same show on the arch allies cd with styx but this is reo on their own and that ai n't love keep pushin and tough guys were added they ca n't stop rockin in fact they sound tighter live than many bands sound in the studio it also contains interviews with kevin and neal on the dvd they are separate from the performance and the dvd also contains 5.1 dolby sound and a trivia game fun and challenging for even longtime fans highly recommended whether or not you 've worn out your copy of the wheels are tourin video
a great film with an engrossing i literally could not take my eyes off peppard 's signature role better than tiffany 's if you long for a movie with a great story buy it ! congrats to paramount for the excellent sharp with great colours and very little evidence of print damage
i 've been a fan of this version of the movie for years i love the theme music and the storyline george pappard is wonderful also definitely dated a lot of sexist stuff pre women 's lib
i 'm a huge fan of the harold robbins novel but i 've got to say that the film is every bit as good and probably better the only thing lacking id the back story about nevada smith but he has his own film as well so i recommend getting that one also overall its a terrific story and in a day and age when its all about special effects this film stands alone as a story and a bloody good one at that
the carpetbaggers '' is a fantastic adaptation of harold robbins ' bestseller very racy for its era with dialogue that is often rare and juicy a superb cast and great direction by edward dmyrtryk the character of jonas cord is loosely based on the life of howard hughes and it is interesting to compare this film with martin scorsese 's the aviator '' both george peppard as cord and leonardo dicaprio as hughes give brilliant performances but overall i find this film far more satisfying and certainly a lot more entertaining peppard was at the height of his career in this film and it is perhaps his best it gives him a wide range of emotions as well as the physicality and toughness he was so good at others that shine in the large cast are alan ladd in what was to be his last film as nevada smith carroll baker as the sultry rina robert cummings as nevada 's slick and slimey manager elizabeth ashely as jonas cord and who soon after this film was to become the real life peppard martin balsam as the owner of a film studio and lew ayres as second in command in jonas cord 's empire has some of the best lines in the film the pacing of the film never lags and there is a brutal fight between jonas and nevada one of those screen fights that is always fascinating to watch the nevada smith character is quite complex and was to spawn a prequel '' 2 years later starring steve mcqueen the cinematography by joseph macdonald is marvelous the edith head gowns lavishly glamorous and very important to the success of this film is the fabulous jazzy score which is one of elmer bernstein 's finest in my youth i devoured all of robbins ' books loved the sleaze of them and loved this film in its theatrical release i 've since watched it repeatedly and find more to enjoy in it with each viewing total running time is 150 minutes
i just finished watching the the carpetbaggers '' on amc i thought the 'c ' part of that acronym was classic '' but now realize that perhaps 'cornball ' 'contagious ' or 'compelling ' may substitute since this movie seemed to be all of this but hey maybe that 's just the gin talkin it is one of those movies that you can not wait to end so you can find out just who these actresses really were yet you continue to watch but when it does end you are somewhat saddened that it is over partially sad because you have been drawn in by this charismatic yet utterly ruthless sob jason cord george peppard but mostly just sad because amc does n't give you the credits ! that 's why i 'm here finding out that the actresses were caroll baker as rina marlowe the hollywood star and elizabeth ashley as monica cord the impossibly forgiving of the ambitious jason bob cummings gets accolades as the fiendishly charming scumbag who plays dan pierce most probably a very typical hollywood agent someone who would put a rattlesnake in your pocket and then ask you for a match if he could get 10 of your blood in doing so go ahead and watch the dern thing stars you 'll understand but hey do n't forgit the gin

surviving 40 days and nights without sex in the film 40 days and 40 nights no sex is kryptonite to josh hartnett 's character matt because he can not go through a day without thinking of sex and it ruins his social life by not being able to talk to girls without having sex on his mind he strongly wants to follow through with his promise to himself by staying pure for the entire 40 days and nights this film is perfectly made for josh hartnett for being such a teenage heartthrob it 's a wonderful comedy full of hilarity and sexy jokes there are all kinds of things to laugh at such as the bagel guy to the crazy roommate many of the characters in the movie are funny and do n't make matt have such an easy time with the whole 40 days and 40 nights it 's not something that he is capable of doing and they all have faith that he will fail matt being a raging sexaholic is a very strong character who attempts to not have sex for lent meaning for an entire 40 days and 40 nights he has to sacrifice what he enjoys most each day matt tries to do something constructive that helps him no think about sex such as model car building and doing laundry in the work place matt 's start a bet to see which day he will break it later turned into an online betting all over the internet prior to all of this he 's been on a sex binge because of his girlfriend left him to dry it 's been the only thing that he knows and helps cope with the pain he 's suffering matt starts to go through sex withdraw and everything he sees turns into some sexy act in his mind he then meets a girl while doing this laundry one day easily there 's an attraction but knowing that he can not have contact with any female physically he keeps to himself and does n't say a word to her as time goes on matt starts to talk to her and makes a date with her the date goes wonderful but instilled in his mind is that he ca n't have any sexual acts with this woman she finds this weird and at her work place she came upon the website with the online bets this made things very difficult for him and her she starts to lose interest in him when he tells her the truth about what he ca n't do this is the first time he 's felt this way for a woman other than his he truly falls for her and this time he did n't have to have sex in his mind he wants to get her back so bad but he has that promise to himself that he feels is more important now the movie becomes the typical love story where boy meets girl boy loses girl then boy will get her back in anybody 's point of view 40 days and nights is torture to a character like matt since he 's such a lady 's man and is extremely sex dependent many people know that 40 days is n't that much but to him it feels like an eternity
anyone who thoroughly enjoyed movies such as the sweetest thing 10 things i hate about you and sweet home alabama will love this movie josh hartnett 's sweet nature in this movie is very cute josh hartnett fans everywhere should flock to this movie
i bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than i remember them i have to admit that they do not compare with the early all in the family episodes but neither do the later all in the family episodes but none the less i am glad they are on dvd and am glad that i purchased them does anyone know if the second season will be available soon
i love archie bunker i have seansons of all in the family i also have season 1 of archie bunker 's plan on getting all of both of these shows i am 24 years old and i love this show
i own every all in the family '' season box set out on the market and started collecting the archie bunker 's place '' season box sets can someone please explain to me why we still get edited versions i thought the idea behind dvd is that we are supposed to get commercial free and unedited versions to my knowledge even all in the family has a few edited episodes why are they doing this it is frustrating
archie bunker 's place '' was a wonderful sequel to the infamously wonderful sitcom 'all in the family ' winnipeg manitoba was wondering about the picture of beverly lasalle on the back cover you 're right the character of beverly lasalle died on all in the family it was a poignant episode during season 8 which was called 'edith 's crisis of faith ' shows like these will go down in the chronicles of television history and thanks to the studio companies for releasing these timepieces on dvd so the world can keep the memory of 'good television ' alive today
archie bunker 's place is not all in the family but very few sitcoms are if you give archie 's bunker 's place a chance you will learn it is better then most highest rated sitcoms on the air today in 2006. this dvd set is very good with mostly uncut episodes as they have not been seen since they aired on cbs archie new partner part 1 seems to be the same syndicated edited version that i recorded off wpsg ch philadelphia back in 1998 with archie 's great line to harry about if old mcdonald had he not expanded farm into a fast food chain and that cornel sanders still would have been a private in the army straggling chickens had he not taken a chance on his chicken joints were not included these lines were kept in the tvland edit in 2002 other then that the rest of the episodes seems to be intact great liner notes inside the dvd with episode credits
i have always enjoyed all in the family and consider it one of the best tv shows ever in any series covers the continuing adventures of archie bunker '' is definitely not as good as aitf but it is a logical extention of that series especially in light of the fact that rob reiner sally struthers and jean stapleton wanted to move on to other things and only archie would remain stapleton was in abp season 1 but was phasing out of the role i never saw either series in their original run too young but i 've seen aitf many many times in reruns and on had n't seen abp since it was rerun on wlvi channel 56 in boston many years ago and it is great to see it girlfriend had never seen it and is a big archie fan and she was thrilled to get it on the day of its release do n't expect to see aitf but if you are a fan of archie bunker you will enjoy this fact that all in the family ended the whole cast but archie basically changed the show became a continuation and it ran for 4 top 20 seasons tells you how powerful a character archie was still in the top 20 when cbs pulled the seems that archie could not be stopped
i 'm not sure why sony home entertainment decided to start releasing archie bunker 's place '' on dvd before all in the family '' was finished nor do i know why they picked such a picture of archie to put on the cover what 's up with that grin he looks like a doofus ! however i will still be purchasing this box set to go along with the aitf sets even though it 's not as good as the original series it 's still worthy to own especially when the episodes are the original uncut versions as usual amazon is the best place to buy it from since it 's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there 's free shipping to boot ! buying this release will only serve to give the publisher more faith in anything with archie bunker so the rest of the aitf seasons might not be too far behind so here 's a good place to cast your vote for it ! you 'll enjoy this set for sure
archie bunker is now the owner of kelsey 's bar in this new he changes the name of the bar but kelsey was the previous owner the bar plays a major role because the title of the sitcom archie bunker 's place is describing the bar on a later episode of all in the family we hear edith say that kelsey was irish so the bar was irish even on the front of this dvd we see the bar in the background this could account for the shamrock on the cover its still a good but does n't have the charm the original had
quite coincidentally this movie was on television last night right after i broke up with my boyfriend and he left we broke up because he does n't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children only to enter into my family consisting of my little boy and me and take on head of household parental responsibilities again while i was single a long time until i married at the age of 38 he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly he wants that time now so he left unlike this movie he does n't walk the streets like billy crystal thinking how great it is to be alone and allegedly a free spirit only to see the light '' and come racing to his girlfriend to tell he that he loves her and when you love somebody you want your relationship to start right now '' ! no in my case he left and he has n't called even though i asked him not to and i 'm fairly certain he is not coming back very sad but a great movie
when harry met sally '' is one of my favorite films it 's one of those movies you can watch again and again and never get sick of it billy crystal and meg ryan are hilarious and bruno kirby and carrie fisher are excellent in their supporting roles i ca n't recommend this movie enough
i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before my interpretation after all these years was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments infatuation etc without stooping to sugary sentiment i took harry and sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable i did n't see them as somehow representative of all men '' or all women '' then i watched the extra documentary on the dvd which i had never seen until now big mistake my new interpretation '' of the film was suddenly cast aside as i remembered that i actually did n't like this movie as much when it first came out over time i had grown to accept the fact that i could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved what i had forgotten was billy crystal 's rob reiner 's director and nora ephron 's writer agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders gag the views of the characters are presented as if they were fact men supposedly always think about sex and ca n't be friends with women most if not all women have faked an orgasm all men are clueless to the fakery and so on i can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the boomer generation and older folks no one on this film is even close being a member of gen x because this does not represent the reality of all humans you 'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to prove '' their case if they 'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it no i wo n't fake it if he sucks in bed i 'm going to tell him '' and as for men some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it none of this changes this classic film that 's the great thing about art it 's open to interpretation i can watch this film and define it my way two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love otherwise i 'd hate this movie but i wo n't give reinder ephron et al that much power just because they were narrow minded about gender roles does n't mean i have to be about their film if you agree with the characters in the film by all means watch the documentary but if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters pass it by do n't let a dvd extra taint your pov
can men and women truely just be friends without sex getting in the way that 's the question the movie 'when harry met sally ' asks and tries it 's best to answer this is the story of two characters that meet during a long drive to new york from the university of chicago at first they ca n't stand each other but they keep running into each other after years of never talking they eventually become best friends and the previous question is put into play i really like this movie this is what a lot of people would call a chick flick '' but it 's a movie that guys can get into as well billy crystal plays the male lead and is great in the role he is funny as always and this was the first movie i had seen him in and what can you say about meg ryan that has n't been said already wow everybody loves meg ryan guys think she is beautiful and retains that 'girl next door ' quality at the same time women just love her movies think she 's a great actress and find her 'cute ' this was the first of her many romantic roles that would go on to define her career i honestly could n't think of a better actress to play this role and she does it flawlessly carrie fisher bruno kirby play key supporting roles here fisher is particularly good as meg ryan 's best friend rob reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out nora ephron who would later go on to direct her own 'chick flicks ' wrote a great script that was basically based off of a lot of real life influences including reiner 's divorce simply put this is a great movie to sit and watch with your girlfriend it 's one of the best romantic comedies i have ever seen billy crystal meg ryan have great chemistry and really own this movie it 's a very funny movie and it goes to show just how different men women really are special features there is a 35 min documentary on the making of the movie the movie was released in 1989 so having a documentary looking back at the movie was great rob reiner nora ephron billy crystal do most of the talking here carrie fisher has some moments meg ryan does n't appear except for old footage from overall it 's a pretty good documentary and surprisingly informative there are also seven deleted scenes included they are all pretty good and could have been included in the movie you also get a music video by harry connick he did the music for the movie trailer and an audio commentary from rob reiner not a bad collection for a genre of movie 'romantic comedy ' that rarely gets special addition treatment
this movie is on my top 5 list harry burns ' theory that men and women can never be friends because the sex always gets it the way is dead nuts accurate sally tries to rebut this with a hypothetical what if the girl is unattractive then can you be friends to which harry in the spirit of all men replies no you pretty much want to nail them too '' finally a romantic comedy with some undertones that men can appreciate great movie
in 1989 a good friend told me this film was excellent i do n't know why but it took me 17 years to act on his good advice in a way i 'm glad back then i might have simply liked the film i 'm not sure i would have recognized it for the evergreen fresh and relevant classic that it is now after one viewing i can and do following their graduation from university of chicago in 1977 harry burns billy crystal is kissing his college sweetheart amanda goodbye when sally allbright meg ryan pulls up in her station wagon to pick him up for the shared drive they have arranged back to new york on the drive harry tells an incredulous sally that men and women ca n't be friends men always want to sleep with women he says noting that she is very attractive when she finally drops him off at washington square park at the foot of fifth avenue sally tells him to have a good life they meet again five years later in an airport where sally as sally now a journalist kisses joe goodbye harry who is traveling on the same plane with sally is acquainted with joe he 's a political consultant and newly engaged to helen once again their personalities seem to clash another five years pass before harry again spies ally this time in a bookstore with her friend marie carry fisher now harry is in the midst of a divorce while sally has split up with joe over the next two years they become the thing that harry said men and women could never be just friends they try dating other people they even try fixing one another up with their respective best friends which brings the friends together as a couple and leaves harry and sally still just friends director rob reiner and writer nora ephron created a comic masterpiece in this film but they could not have done it without the stellar performances from crystal ryan fisher and bruno kirby who plays harry 's friend jess it 's not only worth waiting for good things sometimes it 's really nice too alyssa lappe
watching rob reiners movies is almost always a great pleasure he just gets to the point without overkilling he hits the nerve softly he has the touch of telling the perfect joke he tells stories that make you believe that you are in them a true master in his craft when harry met sally is definitely one of his best it 's a film that does not get older it stays fresh it 's a classic something that has to be seen over and over again
i just rewatched this film and am amazed at how timeless it is except for the clothing of course SMILE this film makes you laugh and shows the great dance of romance of a couple trying to find that ever elusive perfect timing another great film for girls ' night
i love this movie it is a cute movie easy to watch makes you smile alot i think its a girl movie
it 's symptomatic of i suppose to reflect warmly on the good old days '' and even though i never wanted to fall into that syndrome seeing help '' has done exactly that for me i was a freshman in college when the movie was released and so it was a movie for the millions of boomers like me in that bizarre wonderful time that was the 's in america others have already written far more insightfully and fully than i intend to here simply if you like the beatles their witty irreverent and intellectual sense of humor their music and the whole 60 's british invasion '' period you will surely enjoy this comedy it was one last cheerful happy ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60 's before the somber discouraging misery of vietnam settled in for a long long time it could be argued that in a sense my generation lost its sense of humor after help '' if a movie like help '' were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed unless it were positioned as some kind of austin powers spinoff and spoof '' how sick i 've become of that word of the hippie '' period would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other richard lester movies like the three musketeers '' a hard day 's night '' and franco zefferelli 's the taming of the shrew '' you make your own call my generation lived it is n't it a pity that you ca n't buy help '' new anymore is n't it interesting that the company that produced help '' on dvd is mpi which is the same company that despite overpowering demand somehow can not find it possible to release an even more popular academy movie from the becket '' is n't it a pity that you ca n't buy both a hard day 's night '' and help '' as a set is n't it a pity that no one makes movies like help '' anymore
this was the best movie that the beatles did it was funny and had a bit more of a plot this time 'in the weeks that followed five more attemts were made to steal the ring ' quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he he but in 'another girl ' we can only wish that paul would wear that tshirt more often and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music that is before john turned into mountain terrorist anyway okay ! now i 'll actullay reveiw the movie help ! was a clever movie and had a plot ! imagine that ! anyway the movie was about ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring that wont come off sooo ringo must be sacrificed so high preist clang and aimee end up trying to sacrifice him or clang is anyway aimee 's trying to protect him foot and his assistant algenon are after the ring too so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere the bahamas the alps you know well i 'm not gon na give away the ending so you 'll just have to buy the movie and find out so do it ! it 's worth it !
though not the landmark that a hard day 's night '' was this film is still a lot of fun and for current and future generations shows how the beatles looked and behaved in 1965 in full color in fact the color cinematography is striking throughout should have been nominated for an oscar but rather than write a regular review this is a plea to restore the film and present it in a special edition the laserdisc from criterion had many more features than the now out of print dvd release including photographs that thoroughly detail a lost deleted scene early in the film with comedian frankie howerd and this scene set up a later scene which does n't make as much sense until you understand the context from the deleted scene the later scene is the one at scotland yard where klang calls superintendent gluck 's office as soon as the beatles hear the music coming over the phone they plug their ears it 's them ! and the inspector goes into a trance the question is how did the beatles know the music came from klang and to plug their ears the answer was revealed in the deleted scene briefly the beatles visit a guru played by howerd where klang and his henchmen appear and use the music to put the beatles into a trance with ringo incapacitated klang was going to cut off the drummer 's finger but is foiled by george who for the sake of the plot was conveniently wearing earplugs and impervious to the music 's hypnotic effects having once been exposed to the music they knew to plug their ears in the scene at scotland yard btw two pictures of the deleted scene are at the film 's photo section at and unless it has since been corrected howerd is incorrectly identified as brian epstein in the photos ' caption perhaps the scene has been found since the criterion laserdisc was released and if so it would be a very special feature but footage aside for me the ideal special edition dvd would have two soundtracks with the original mono soundtrack and mixes of the songs as well as the later stereo mixes the original soundtrack may have also contained foley effects over the songs sounds outside of the dialog like footsteps and the such perhaps even the sound of the darts hitting the screen in the opening number that was eradicated when the distributors replaced the mono songs with those in stereo finally the restored version would have the most glaring omission from all the dvd releases the original aspect ratio i recall reading quotes from the distributors of the previous releases defending the release of help ! '' in a full screen stating that it was n't a widescreen movie to begin with ok it was n't el cid '' but then again it was n't as squarish as the tv screen and viewing the previous releases you can obviously see that there is more than what is viewed full screen there was no reason not to release it widescreen and this version must have that restored it 's still amazes me that the criterion ld was also fullscreen considering presenting discs widescreen was one of their big selling points at the time i hope this does n't get too buried under all the other reviews in fact i hope that someone inflential sees this and takes action otherwise i hope someone somewhere in the beatles ' org is thinking about this and it actually happens provided the original elements like the mono soundtrack are n't altogether lost
i first saw help ! when i was in middle school rifling through my parents ' vhs collection my friends and i were won over by this silly comedy and the fab four and i have treasured the movie ever since it is unfortunate that the us dvd release is out of print i had to buy an imported version and i hope they bring it back soon so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy the plot is pure genius in its simplicity a gaudy red ring gets stuck on ringo 's finger a sacrificial cult chases him around the world trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice a mad scientist is determined that he could dare i say it rule the world if he could only get the ring off ringo 's finger the beatles are absolutely clueless so they run around the world dodging crazy people at every turn singing songs and generally being hilarious the dvd i bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in french so once you 've seen help ! enough times to know every line by heart try it out in a foreign language and laugh even harder at the beatles speaking in french go to the window go to the
the beatles accomplished so much good at music good at recording and capturing their magic good at transferring their personalities and appeal onto film help ! is meant to be fun and it has some slapstick elements mostly due to ringo 's abilities as a straight man he was always the most honest one and he holds the film together if anyone feels he did n't do as much as the others then this film is the evidence to the contrary the beatles ' humour style incorporates elements of the goons and peter sellers who was a friend of theirs enjoy this silly film and marvel at the best of the songs in it
help hit theater screens in 1965 in glorious color or colour if you prefer the previous year 's a hard day 's night had budget constraints that restricted it among other things to black and white with the runaway success of a hard day 's night the ante was upped considerably to provide help with color negative numerous location shoots fabulous sets and what we could call today superb music videos richard lester again took the directorial helm of this second beatles movie richard lester films have traditionally been off beat comedies and help is no exception unlike hard day 's night where the screenplay called for the beatles to act through an exaggerated simulated and believable day in their lives help had a cloak and daggar plot we find religious zealots from the mystic east chasing ringo across southern england switzerland and the bahamas to recover a sacred sacrificial ring the incompetence of the pursuers is barely exceeded by the beatles protectors scotland yard okay so there is not much plot here help is basically a fun filled romp with the beatles with some great music included in fact the budget was so generous that film locations were chosen almost arbitrarily to provide the beatles with mini vacations the beatles of course play themselves veteran actor leo mckern is the chief villian victor spinetti who entertained us as the television producer in hard day 's night returns as the mad scientist lovable roy kinnear willy wonka and the chocolate factory the three musketeers is the professor 's assistant eleanor bron a little princess and patrick cargill around the world in eighty days also costar help has been twice since the the only drawback to this film is that the original movie soundtrack was improved '' in the original print which occasionally shows up on amc the original music soundtrack complete with background sound effects is still present the new dvd release uses digitally remastered music that can be found on the cd soundtrack unfortunately not all of these versions are the same tracks from the original movie for example the title song help is the version from the american capitol lp the original film used the single version the original track which can be found on old 45 rpm singles as well as on the beatles rarities album is slightly faster and has a heavier vocal emphasis on the word help '' other songs are missing subtle background sound effects as they were blotted out by the redubbing of the music tracks the dvd has a few special features including the movie trailer it is too bad that the original black and white promotional film for the song help that we see during the opening credits albeit without darts hitting the screen is not included on the dvd still the dvd is a marked improvement over the last 20 years worth of vhs releases in my younger years i enjoyed help much more than a hard day 's night now i am not so sure they are two very diverse films i give five stars to a hard day 's night for originality and four stars to help for color and music
if you remember the and the james bond era then this movie needs no introduction to simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes for newer viewers it may seem confusing the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says and they knew it that comes accross to some viewers as they just did whatever they wanted '' and they certaintly did ! the james bond connection will come once the fan sees goldfinger or thunderball the beatles themselves called this movie as it excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted a must own no matter who you long as you like the beatles be open and enjoy
it is a pleasure to watch the beatle 's film help '' it 's easy listening lighthearted and a nice snapshot '' in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game ! all the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie nevertheless to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of john lennon is worth the purchase on it 's own ! but to know that this was one of the first exposures of indian music for george harrison and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life is an extremely rare treat indeed ringo starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and paul mccartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a member of the band with the lovely leading high priestess a must see for new and renewed fans alike
my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl 's moving castle it has the same kind of story and if you like 's moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too
my neighbor totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother who is in a nearby hospital the animation is stunningly done with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum voice acting in the original japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind this is one of the best dubs i have heard with the english voice actors obviously 'getting ' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required my wife and i both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters age 6 and 2 causing them to buy a number of other ghibli films highly recommended
family movies do n't get much better than this no no and yet most mature adults will find it most enjoyable miyazaki 's animation style is always a welcome touch there are japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times however the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good friendly spirit '' movie kids will enjoy totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with and get a chuckle out of several conversations between parents and their children this is one of those movies from which you will get the warm fuzzies '' share it with others in your family
a good animated film with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations it also protrays children 's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural the father 's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming
my granddaughter absolutely loves this movie and she 's only one year old not to mention that my husband and i saw the movie first and decided we had to buy it for her we have watched and enjoyed it many times
the world of totoro is such a magical place totoro will lead you on the adventure of a just hop on the and we 're off ! i would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5 for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world it 's just sop the beautiful world of totoro you 'll always be safe ! got sorta lost in my own world there ! well anyway please buy this movie ! it 's the best in the whole entire world ! please !
my wife 4 year old daugthter and i all liked spirited away and kiki 's delivery service and so a friend recommended this movie to me he said it was a great family movie it did n't sound that interesting so i did n't purchase it right away finally one day when i saw a link about it on amazon i decided to go for it we had no idea what we were in for but not one of us was disappointed if fact the whole family has watched totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago my daughter espcially can not get enough of it it is very fun heart warming and humorous we recommend every family get a copy of this movie you wo n't regret it we have since collected 5 of miazaki and studio ghibli 's films and we plan to purchase more in the future btw if you like this also check out wisper of the heart '' another great studio ghibli film have fun we know you will if you watch this movie
this is an excellent movie for all ages ! get it now experience the magic wonderful story acting and attitude sets this movie from all others
my neighbor totoro is a simply wonderful story it portrays innocence and family love at its best and is very delightful to watch
the story was both simple and unencumbered yet soulful and sweet the movie has pleasant and beautiful animation bright colors soft lines the characters and their offscreen personalities all are present and make for a fine children 's film that both children will enjoy and parents can endure i had to sit through pokemon movies most of them too yuck ! for me the best part of the film was the soundtrack jack johnson 's tuneful songs with catchy lyrics made the film very special the soundtrack quickly became one of my favorite cds a must see film for small children this film is destined to be a classic and reminded me why i loved the curious george books when i was a child myself
curious george is fantastic although many people might think that this movie is only made for children adults will get a kick out of this movie as well the music that accompanies the film is great it is a warm story that allows you to escape from adult life drudgery and remember what it is to explore and be curious about the world
i did n't grow up reading curious george books as i was little so this movie was my first exposure to the character and now i know everyone in my family will be reading and watching george for a very long time the story was cute and touching yet at the same time it was fun and engaging the animation was simple but very tasteful giving the characters a special glow '' that made them stand out and offering numerous shots using angles that are not too usual in animated features i particularly remember the one of george running on top of buildings trying to catch ted yellow hat where the shot is shown from above as if there were a flying camera focusing on george in the end you feel great when the movie is over and to keep you entertained longer there 's lots of fun extra features to even teach you how to draw george so whether you are a parent a kid or simply an admirer of nice animated stories curious george is a winner for all
was a cute movie overall i enjoyed it it was a simple storyline with george along with his curiosity getting himself and the man in the yellow hat in trouble anyways i had a couple of good laughs even though this movie was geared towards kids you could pick up a couple of lines that were meant for adults it was a bit puzzling to see ted the man in the yellow hat as a goofball nonetheless it worked well into the movie and george named after george washington ! ! anyways like i said cute movie that anyone will enjoy
my four year old loved this movie the plot was very simple and easy to follow nothing too complicated for her the animation was also great for the movie 's target audience very soft and warm it 's a little film and george is such a sweet funny and cute little guy throughout it was light on plot probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six but such a cute movie that i did n't get bored watchingn it with her this is a great movie for young children
this a very well done remake of a children book it kept thing simple with the basic idea of george being curious running into adventure in search for the man in the yellow hat i never felt the storyline or were every over the top like the cat in the hat not as fanatic as cg and other animations coming out this days i would recommend this as a solid family movie dvd problem there is some issue with this movie on older dvd set in which it does not play or skip this is very annoying base on a new type of encoding why did i watched a children movie just curious how george has grown curious george does n't talk if you were wondering but the man in the yellow hat does
well i rented this movie for my seven year old because i grew up on curious george and wanted to share that adventure with her as well she only speaks spanish and this movie has a spanish language track i watched the movie before her to hear it in english i tell you i was swept in from the dvd menu this is an absolutely adorable movie from the animation the voices of wil ferrel and others to the music to the way too cute curious george to the wonderful feel of the story there are even some nice lessons about honesty and love personally i loved this movie and i 'm 40 years old the spanish voice overs were very well done as well and my daughter also loved the movie although i laughed out loud more often than her i 'll be waiting for the sequel
well loved children 's character curious george is now on dvd in a brand new feature length adventure curious george the animated feature includes the voice talent of drew barrymore and will ferrell kids wo n't really care who lends voice talent to this gem as the film begins ted the man in the yellow hat is seen working a museum when the museum is suddenly in a financial crisis to save the museum ted is summoned to the museum curator 's office and sent on a mission to africa to look for a mysterious item that will bring visitors back to the museum ted heads to the outback outfitter store where he is fitted with his trademark yellow suit once he arrives in africa with the crew ted is shocked to discover what they felt would be a huge item that would save the museum is actually a small little statue that fits into the palm of his hand ted does meet a curious fun little brown monkey as he leaves africa set for the shores of america the little monkey who has taken his yellow hat stows away on the ship soon after he arrives back home ted discovers that the little monkey who he names george is a part of his life at home kids will really love this film mine did the dvd also includes some cool bonus features the games are easy to play with the dvd remote there are also features the running time of curious george is one hour and twenty eight minutes
this is a great movie i think al pacino and robin williams definitely clicked in this movie the plot was excellent and pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time
al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate a murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it he has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner he creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer robin williams did it very good movie
this is another american remake of the original danish movie starring stellan skarsgard which is more interesting than this remake i always wonder why when hollywood does a remake they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place even though i give this remake 4 stars mainly because al pacino and robin williams restrained themselves and that hollywood changed the ending check out the original i give the danish original 5 stars
insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies and the consequnces they can produce it is very well acted on both pacino 's and williams part and swank was brilliant as well besides all that good stuff i am also a fan of the director ever since i saw batman begins '' and find his artistic vision to be incredible the only problem i had with this movie was the ending sure it showed how lying could defeat a person but i thought a little redemption would have been nice however if you have a strong stomach or a good editing company i suggest you see this
al pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets the white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale patrick mcgerve
christopher nolan 's insomnia '' is a fantastic film that manages to top the original this police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end al pacino has one of his best roles in years he 's still the man ! robin williams was better in one hour photo '' but he 's not glaringly miscast as others rest of the cast is with hillary swank being particularly good the credit for this film 's greatness belongs to director nolan he 's created a tense visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches and stands as one of the best movies of the decade
this is one of the big '' warner definitely not in the same class as my fair lady '' or the music man '' it 's as good as finian 's rainbow '' and much better than camelot '' speigelgass 's script wisely lets arthur laurents ' book virtually speak for beckman and ralph hurst 's sets and howard shoup 's costumes harry stradling 's photography and frank perkins 's musical direction are all leroy 's direction is very good especially in the dramatic cast is excellent with rosalind russell natalie wood and karl malden particularly outstanding faith dane roxanne arlen and jean willes stop the show with a hilarious you got ta get a gimmick '' in all a good musical that provides an evening of solid entertainment
i love musicals and gypsy '' is one of my faves i adore rosalind russell 's portrayal of rose and love natalie wood too it 's really got it all great songs great performances a classic i can watch over and over
my mother took me to the movies to see gypsy starring rosalind when i was about 10 years old i fell in love with the movie natalie wood became a beautiful swan i just love that movie i watched the movie with my daughter although she had seen it on tv with all the commercials she enjoyed it so much i am going to purchase her a copy
based on the hit broadway play mervyn leroy directed this musical gem rosalind russell is mama rose the mother of all stage mothers grooming her two young daughters for stardom on the vaudeville stage she pays special attention to her youngest child blond baby june while louise is relegated to the background as time goes on the vaudeville craze fades with the coming of talkie films and now her bubbly blond darling danity june ann jilliann is desperate to break free deserting the family act rose is forced to start from scratch with wallflower louise natalie wood who was always in her sister 's shadow as the headliner in a new act which basically goes nowhere one day rose and her troop now called rose louise and her hollywood blondes wind up in a burlesque theater and young louise finds herself drawn into the the role of a stripper she sheds her shy persona and becomes the world 's most famous stripper gypsy rose lee ethel merman originated rose on the stage but roz russell does more than an adequate job despite the fact that her singing voice was dubbed in some musical numbers she is strong overbearing a little eccentric but at the same time she commands the audience 's sympathy when she realizes that her ambition has just driven her daughters away and she finds herself alone with no one to live through anymore natalie wood gives a touchingly vulnerable performance her thin but endearing singing voice expressing louise 's pain and confusion in extraordinary volumes since she was groomed by an obsessive stage mother herself wood really had the the material to draw from her lessons from the real gypsy rose lee undoubtedly helped in her character 's transformation from a shy girl to sophisticated stripper the striptease numbers are fabulous who does n't shed her a tear when she sings little lamb '' or feels enthralled as she performs let entertain you '' as she studies herself before a mirror prior to her first night on the burlesque stage she sees her beauty for the first time i 'm pretty i 'm a pretty girl mama ! '' when she makes her mark she engages in an argument with her controlling mother bringing both to a heartache and later an understanding you really could have been something mother '' louise informs rose after catching a bit of her performance '' on the empty stage having seen the 1993 version starring bette midler i still prefer this one no matter what anyone says roz is not miscast and this film does not in my opinion have any clumsy '' moments it is a vintage hollywood musical karl malden gives a comedic and committed performance as rose 's suitor herbie who wants her to marry him and who wants to provide a home for her kids a young morgan brittney plays little baby june seeing her makes you think of her as the jon benet '' of the it 's finally on dvd as it deserves to be the letterbox enhances the film in a way that videos never could everything 's coming up roses
i loved this version as a little girl and grew up with it i usually do not comment on others reviews but i feel i must respond to a comment that this version of gypsy is definately not a wrong ! how could anyone say this masterpiece is not a classic it is the role that made natalie wood a star ! the movie is wonderful and as far as roz not having a good singing voice i believe that was done on am quite sure the knew she had a rough voice she portrayed a tough broad '' as some might say who was street smart and some songs do n't have the typical good voice '' to them look at joe cockers you are so beautiful '' his voice cracks more than once and especially at the end of the song and that song stayed number one for a very long time and is still a classic today so yes her voice is rough but again i say that was whole demeanor was rough around the edges as far as all the characters being mismatched i feel quite the contrary they meshed movie has that wonderful nostalgic quality that puts you right there and you really feel for all of the characters this musical has such depth great it 's fun and snappy and happy and sad and just everything that movies today are n't musical is pure entertainment it actually takes you away and puts you right there feeling all the emotions of the characters the sadness of mama 's favortism toward june louise 's anger toward her mama the mama 's sadness at louise 's rejection of her after she becomes a stripper the sadness of joe it 's been so long i ca n't even remember if this was his name when roz would n't marry him the upbeat song mama get married today '' and the so very sad song little hen little fish '' that louise sang to her birthday present you definately get caught up in the performances i say if you 've never seen it watch it if you have seen it revisit it again it is like seeing an old friend i have n't seen it in a long time but i have looked for it in different stores under musicals or classics and i can never find it hopefully i can find a copy on amazon i always wished they would make a gypsy 2 set in that era but of course even if they did it could n't touch the original which brings me back to my point in the beginning it is a classic and a great one at that and always will be i just wish i could give it ten stars
this is by far the best version of this musical the song and dance numbers are excellent and the characters strong orchestration is bright and snappy and true to the original stage score a classic that every serious collector should have !
i love gypsy '' i remember seeing this film when i was 7 with my mom and sister and it was condemed by the catholic mom was so worried she would go to hell when she found out later this was on the list of movies not to is fantastic and i love natalie woods performance but this is rosalind russell 's 's so funny and the energy this women had is unreal and for a person who ca n't sing i could hear her version of everythings comming up rosses '' everyday and still enjoy is a classic and i 'm going to watch this dvd again tonight
the catch phrase used repeatedly in this 1962 warner bros screen version of the broadway classic gypsy '' is let me entertain you ! and that is certainly what this wonderful musical succeeds perfectly in doing boasting off screen credentials such as stephen sondheim for lyrics choreography by jerome robbins and direction by hollywood veteran mervyn leroy with a superb cast from the legendary rosalind russell through to natalie wood and karl malden you just know this movie is going to be something special debate still rages over the casting of rosalind russell in the central role of the stage mother from hell rose hovick in place of broadway legend ethel merman who had one of her greatest broadway triumphs in the role in much the same way as audrey hepburn 's casting as eliza doolittle over julie andrews in my fair lady '' drew heated discussion the debate over gypsy '' will undoubtedly continue forever rosalind russell certainly makes the central character of the pushy dominering stage mum her own here and provides in my belief much of what is memorable in this film version of the classic story indeed gypsy '' still has that warm appealing show biz flashiness about it that makes a viewing a wonderful nostalgic experience there have been many back stage stories filmed but gypsy '' is certainly one of the best of it 's kind and boasts many fine qualities that allow it to stand on it 's own artistic merits side by side with its illustrious broadway parent gypsy '' of course recounts the rise to notoriety of one of last centuries most famous burlesque queens the one and only gypsy rose lee of course the most colourful character in the story and the one most prominently featured in arthur laurent 's book on which the play was based was that of the mother the unstoppable momma rose hovick who was unrelenting in her push to see her daughters as stars of the vaudeville circuit the film chronicles the ambitions of momma rose through a long series of performing engagements across america where the spot light is always on the youngest of the three times married rose 's two daughters june in an act headlined by baby '' june morgan brittany billed as suzanne cupito who slowly develops through the years into dainty '' june ann jillian the format never changes and finds elder daughter louise reduced to being the front end of a cow prop used in the act rose has an unfailing belief in the talent of her daughters and brushes aside the attentions of besotted manager herbie sommers karl malden because he wants to marry rose settle down and give the girls a proper home in one place as the years go by the families fortunes take a turn for the worst and the great depression wipes out the last vestiges of the old vaudeville circuit living from hand to mouth dainty june '' becomes tired of always playing a child and runs off and gets married rose turns her attention on the less extroverted louise and revamps the act to spotlight her however all the magic has gone and when the troupe are booked in as a support act at a burlesque theatre the whole group 's lives are changed forever louise is dragged in to replace a missing act and despite it involving a strip tease number rose sees the chance for louise to gain star status and thus gypsy rose lee '' is born louise becomes an unexpected sensation and celebrity in burlesque however rose begins to feel shut out and having also lost herbie who tired of waiting for her to marry him she sees a lonely old age on her own ahead of her however in the best tradition of show business a reconciliation occurs at the eleventh hour which sees the overpowering momma rose back in her daughters life for a happy finale coming on the heels of its broadway predecessor this movie version does not suffer at all for the changes in cast rosalind russell a fine comedian from right back in the 1930 's does a wonderful job of bringing this monsterous but still likeable stage mother to life the character is essentially a combination of many notorious broadway and hollywood stage mothers and she brings her great comic skills to the forefront to make rose the most meaty character in the story what is important about russell 's performance is that she always manages to bring the deep down humanity behind the ruthless ambition into her playing of rose and her scenes towards the end of the film when gypsy has discarded her are nothing short of brilliant in turning audiences sympathies back onto her character natalie wood one of hollywood 's most beautiful young women of the time plays the central role of gypsy and she displays just the right elements of awkwardness and vulnerability in her early scenes combined with the supreme confidence she displays in the later scnes when she is a great success as a burlesque queen she has great chemistry with rosalind russell and their scenes when the power base in the relationship changes are especially noteworty karl malden has the difficult role of herbie rose 's long time love and he makes great dramatic worth out of his decades long love for a woman more interested in turning her children into stars than getting married to him his departure scene when he finally says goodbye to rose is particulary poignant finally young ann jillian deserves special mention for her wonderful playing of dainty '' june momma 's favourite who is never allowed to grow up in the act the scenes of her as a teenager still playing a baby are both comical and tragic if there is such a thing possible the overall production of gypsy '' does great credit to its broadway parent and the period recreation over many decades stunning costumes designed by the legendary orry kelly and the wonderful choreography by jerome robbins is first rate despite her different singing style to broadway 's ethel merman russell handles the musical numbers with relish including everthing 's coming up roses '' some people '' you 'll never get away from me '' and rose 's turn '' while i 'm not an authority on broadway musicals i always find gypsy '' has a fresh and endearing quality to its story that while being at times brash is also sensitive and moving in its quieter moments would ethel merman have made the part of rose a truly memorable creation in the movie version who knows but what we have here is one of the better early 1960 's hollywood musicals that succeeds on many different levels put some time away soon and catch this great hollywood musical rosalind russell is sure to dazzle you with her energy and with the uniqueness of her stage mum to end all stage mums enjoy ! ! !
without a doubt dave chappelle created one of the greatest shows to air on television but i might just be saying too much or not everything he does will crack you up and if it does n't you have no sense of humor while i do n't have the first season yet i have seen the whole thing and it is worth the purchase 100 dave chappelle is n't a blind comedian who let 's power get in his way he knows what 's best for him and that is another reason why he is one of the best comedians in america today there are many hilarious sketches that somehow were beat by the next season but that 's no reason to skip this set ! this contains all the episodes fully uncensored as we want them and funny as h e l l commentary by dave and neal there are also bonus features that need your attention there is no thinking over to do go buy it now
this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time dave 's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling profaine and insightful show chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it 's ear ! this set is n't for everyone but if like me the skit of the blind black white supermacist watch to understand is just the funniest bit i have seen in years like i said this is not for all taste as the laungage is very corse and the skits are very much geared for adults keep the kids away ! ! ! but for those with the sence of humor to like dave this is a great collection to have !
the chapelle show is equal parts hit or miss or for every brilliant sketch that has you simultaneously shaking your head in amazement while you slap your knee in amusement a hit there is a bit where you just shake your head at how embarrasingly lame it is the miss and then there are the solid bits that are pretty funny but no great shakes hits a blind black white supremacist genius and for some reason i love the musical interlude where dave and mos def cruise around while mos def raps near miss the real world sketch with a white guy staying with some of the most criminal blacks that dave and his writers could concoct was so real '' and cruel it was just brutal yet kind of funny too miss lots and lots of lame sketches
chappelle 's show is a hilarious piece of work that should be required viewing for sweet stuff like the kelly spoof dave playing a psychic the magic video camera spoofs of famous movies like deep impact the matrix and pretty woman and so much more makes this set a must have for highly reccomended laugh riot 5 stars and a bag of chip
i got the dave chapelle 's seasons 1 2 for my husband as a valentine 's day gift and he loved it definitely recommended !
this dvd is hilarious it is well worth the money and i can watch it over and over again dave chappelle is a great comedian and i am just sorry there wo n't be any more seasons to purchase
the funniest show around ! this is the funniest show i 've seen since mad tv dave chappelle is a genius i put him up with chris rock and eddie murphy any day this dvd was crazy i really loved the crack head tyrone biggums you really need to get this dvd you do not know what you are missing ! ! ! !
this dvd rocks ! this dude is as funny as they come very original and different the new king of comedy
after being thouroughly amused by chapelle 's show season 2 on dvd i purchased the season 1 dvd box set since i had only seen a few shows from the debut series while this is a worthy set to own it 's not as funny as the second season few of the skits will have a lasting effect on you and just arent memorable it 's funny but just not as funny as the season 2 dvd box set
i really did n't think i was going to like this show but it 's actually pretty good it is n't the funniest thing i 've ever seen but it 's well done decently funny the characters come across as real people for the most part and there is n't any smug condescension towards them the performances are good for this type of thing some of my favorite moments are thomas lennon 's closeted gay cop getting his bike stolen constantly the jokes the cops play on unsuspecting motorists like arresting the pizza delivery guy so they could take his pizza the episode where the homeland security '' guy fools all of the reno police department and when the fbi comes in for a murder investigation and reduces the department to a bunch of gophers you 're not going to see groundbreaking brilliant satire here but you wo n't be bored either overall a decent series
when you love being with the characters of a show does the matter the answer is 'yes ' if you are a fan of the only reality show on tv 'cops ' much like the comedy classics 'wkrp ' 'mary tyler moore ' 'cheers ' and others 'reno 911 ' gives us characters who are fun to be with they are confused silly illogical occasionally and even racist at times a camera zooms in on any one of them seemingly out of nowhere at a moment 's notice and shows us glimpses of them engaged in petty workplace gossip or romance in the meantime they are all in sheriffs ' department uniform crashing the police car conducting stings that go wrong firing their guns with reckless abandon deciphering vanity plates on cars while in pursuit and chasing bizarre criminals around reno or its trailer parks in addition to being on the reno police force niecy nash also the star of the home improvement show 'clean house ' provides cameos of a wacko woman with a penchant for disturbing the peace and stealing police cars and weapons in the final episode watch for garcia played by carlos alazraqui to lose it and disappear laughing hysterically at nash 's escapades i discovered 'reno 911 ' while and tuned in for a few repeat episodes because a it was truly funny and b was a spoof of one of my favorite shows 'cops ' i had never bought a before and decided that i wanted to give this one a try and watch this particular series sequentially and commercial free beginning with episode 1. i am so glad i did thankfully there is no laugh track nor is there one on tv either each episode is skillfully and evenly written and produced very funny and stands alone some episodes also include audio commentary this stuff works highly recommended for all students of comedy and fans of 'cops
it is hilariously quirky very random just as i like i
i was first introduced to this show by a friend in the usa i 'm in australia who asked if i 'd seen it no i had n't then i saw an episode on cable in a hotel and i knew what he was talking about the situations are great lots of improv but you 'd never know it it 's very natural this show is the funniest on tv i bought a dvd player just so i could watch this i know some cops who have seen it and they say it 's funny as hell you ca n't get much better than that lot 's of in '' jokes for real cops too if you know a cop buy it for them ! i love the start of shift briefings quickdraw to see who has to go out and buy lunch that is funny
this season is where it all began folks it will have you rolling on the floor over and over it is worth it
great shows ! had to call 911 to help me stop laughing it 's just too funny
amazon was spot on again with fast delivery and the show was what i expected for anyone who has seen the show you know what to expect for those who have n't it will be a fun new experience
a truly original series of laughs pay attention there is a lot of subtle humor that is brilliant but not always caught the first time around dangle and the gang are great
reno 911 is one of the best comedy spoofs on television today the comedy is original and catches the viewer unaware the of the jokes and the visual punch lines provide a new type of comedy entertainment in the same way as the monty python routines broke new comedy ground the actors of reno 911 portray a wonderful combination of sterotypes that significantly enhance the humor of the series few tv comedy shows have ever arrived at the level of reno 911. when watching reno 911 you do n't just smile you do n't just chuckle you laugh out loud and in this day and time it do n't get much better than that ''
this show is one of the funniest on comedy central today it 's full of sick humor that just keeps you laughing through each episode definately worth buying the first season on dvd
this is the first novel of john grisham and like the movie it 's very strong in characters and dialogue at the time he wrote it there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer ' movies witness for the prosecution '' comes to mind and we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like parker crais lehane george and grafton but the novel was uncharted land and grisham plowed it over with a passion how was grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given evil empire '' writers like len deighton and john lecarre fits eventually the public would tire at lawyers even laughing at them nevertheless it 's a good book and also an excellent movie if there are drawbacks then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust the lawfirm itself for example sexual misconduct in a lawfirm sure misconduct in billing always stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains occasionally but murdering associates who try to leave i do n't think so but it does give department of justice cop ed harris a great line in the movie mcdeere no one has left your firm alive ! '' the movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it the lovely jeanne tripplehorn the this time not very grandfatherly wilfred brimley holly hunter always a hoot gary busey hal holbrook and law and order 's steven hill to mention a few and tom cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and abbey 's rainbow has a hazmat sticker on it that he 's overlooked cruise is just great a true hitchkockian character the average man with no where to run what would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom that 's the firm 5 stars larry scantlebur
nothing can be better than the firm '' written by john grisham who himself is a lawyer the attentions to details that grisham manages to pull are just fantastic i read the book before watching the movie and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book as the book gets slow in between but not the movie cruise 's is superb so are the other actors in this movie i do n't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios this is a movie based on a fiction novel and as rightly said by one of reviewer here it does its job by entertaining the audiences
the story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues the real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives i had to watch the movie 's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished i wonder what lawyers fbi agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie most of us do n't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot the good guy mitch mcdeere wins over evil not only because he 's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck mitch is so lucky that the story strains example mitch 's wife gets to know all of a sudden that gene hackman 's character who has important documents to copy is not going to dive as mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him well good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life at the same time the movie shows legal procedures by real life lawyer john grisham the movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished in real life criminals hardly ever go to jail even less killed by the good guys everybody knows this what not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems the movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into finally the suspense is well organized moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes yes this is very compelling movie to recommend watching beware that this movie deals at some degree with the conservative vs liberal cultural war the bad guys had to be the southern conservatives who want to rule other people 's lives according to their own hypocrite standards meanwhile the good guys are liberals from ne i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows in negative ways all i guess is that jg realized what would be accepted by the entertainment industry and wrote according to it anyways this is just a movie and it does what it 's supposed to do to entertain
this is a smartly written and drama tom cruise plays a sharp young harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob great supporting help from gene hackman and wilford brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors
the firm a great story and an amazing movie read the story and just now i watched the movie great to read the story and then watch its movie be able to see what you imagined while reading the book ! i recomend the firm to all ! and if you can get the book and read it first be more fun ! trust me ! enjoy
the dvd is great and so was the price the movie is excellent ! ! ! ca n't stop watching it !
i read the book and then the book i saw the movie not once but twice it is somewhat different from the book i like pollock a lot his movies are so interesting to me that i could'nt wait for the movie to come out the acting was well done only one flaw casting tom cruise in this otherwise well developed movie everyone else does a great job of acting here to me though tom is miscasted he seems to be out of place his thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but he just did'nt click of what sidney wanted the character to be and do sorry cruise fans he is wasted as far as i am concerned gene hackman and as well as ed harris they did well a great movie but could have been better without cruise here
if you 're looking for exciting chase scenes gratutious nudity explicit sex scenes and formulaic then this one is not for you but you will love this movie if you love dance dancers searchers for true love cynics whom true love find oddballs who find their one true soul mate and good guys who win in the end all in one underrated and underreviewed masterpiece ignore the naysayers take a chance and see this one share it with someone you love you will not regret it
it is n't great drama but all in all it is interesting craig ferguson is great in it he even sings he make the whole film worth watching
this was a fun movie ! salsa lovers will relate new salsa lovers will really relate
i love this film obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot to me it 's the quintessential brit flick absolutely what we do best but i do n't consider it a rom com at all it 's very bitter sweet and if all you 're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you 're missing the point of this film every character had a dark thread running through them a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made but it 's also about hope and the message that i get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past you can always overcome them or redeem yourself adrian lester was as always wonderful at the emotional of the film btw if you ever get the chance to see him do shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween ' so my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film
hubby and i have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand english accents that are other than what one hears on the bbc and are referred to as posh '' or upperclass we now turn on the english subtitles and watch them that way it used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we 'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them with the advent of english subtitles being on all dvds those days are over the film is a relationship film set in london and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local salsa dance club every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones there is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting instead these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too i ca n't say i need to own this film but for an evening 's viewing it was a lot of fun there are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another they are n't part of the other action but as comedy sketches their scenes together are gems
born romantic cuts a slice of life out of london life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types and it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive the homing center for these disparate people is a salsa club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue one woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance another is a bisexual who fears relationships another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male the men are equally edgy from a scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman to a atm robber to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch how they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey the acting is excellent the timing first rate and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the londoners just turn on the english subtitles and you wo n't miss a thing a lovely film full of surprises
you know i normally have no use for romantic comedies let alone romantic comedies that revolve around cultural traditions but this was i must admit quite good this is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs in spite of not being at all funny the fact that the characters are by and large helps too and including the cab driver the only one in london apparently as a central unifying figure was a good idea that worked i can not help but compare born romantic to sidewalks of new york a film i hated two stars was a bit generous methinks that film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships but it got bogged down in its smugness never allowing the charaters to actually be people this on the other hand does it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience of course it also did n't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either recommended
i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce this film combines humor romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony i ca n't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways
i first watched this movie because cinamatic legand joan crawford was one of the stars in it joan plays amanda farrow a rather bossy publishing executive however her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character it 's a fine picture though at first glance the best of everything '' looks like 9 to 5 '' meets the devil wears prada '' but after the first twenty minutes i was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the big apple the main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm played by hope lange diane baker and suzy parker each women has their own trials and tribulations but i think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads i would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring is this how men really were in the 1950 's i hope not normally i 'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this but since it 's joan 's last great picture '' not counting baby jane '' of course it deserves four
if you 're an old movie buff as i am i think you will like this one i have seen it on tv but it is one for the collection i have watched it twice already since i got it
an entertaining soap opera the best of everything succeeds especially because of its brilliant capturing of 1959. the attitude the fashion the lifestyle the vernacular and both ennervating and bittersweet the culture once you 've enjoyed the movie itself sit back and relish the great commentary track with both the original novel 's author and an amusing film historian you 'll get quite a few chuckles along with fascinating facts about everything pertaining to the film and the times and circumstances around which it was made wonderful to see so many great stars in all their colorful glory ! also included a trailer and newsreel beautiful trasnfer a first rate dvd experience
the architecture fashion interior design of america is all right here in nyc you just ca n't beat it ! ! yeah it 's corny in more places in one but the overall effect is one you do n't want to miss
this 1959 soapy saga does indeed have everything lecherous old geezers making passes at sweet young things bitter old hags sleeping with married men bosses who take their frustrations out on underlings and sex ! sex ! sex ! rona jaffe 's bestselling book think peyton place set in mdhattan tells the tale of three young woman who work in the publishing world of nyc modern gals who dream dare and damn themselves while wearing terrific clothes that they could n't afford on a secretary 's salary the cast includes hope lange suzy parker louis jordan diane baker and stephen boyd who better to add extra star power than joan crawford as a senior editor who treats her employees the way her lover treats her like dirt sometimes the best films are the worse thank god
i really miss the genre loosely called women 's pictures '' that combined wonderfully lurid storylines with hays code dialog and major major fashion unfortunately nowadays the closest we get is the really crude sex and the city '' whose scripts leave nothing to the imagination and where the fashion '' comes direct from walmart the best of everything '' scores major points for a great looking cast dynamite clothes and wonderfully trashy storylines if this is n't the ultimate popcorn movie what is ! ! ladies invite your friends over rustle up some major munchies fire up this dvd and have a whale of a good time ! !
i remember those days i used to dress up for work the high heels and stockings and garter belts before pantyhose i like this movie and always try to catch it when it 's on tv i know i 'll catch heck for saying this but i miss those days during the so called women 's lib '' days women were very cruel to other woman who wanted to be married and raise a family i used to say back to these woman this is america we have a choice '' of course i was shouted down so i learned to keep my opinions to myself whatever we 've gained from women 's lib '' much much more work if you ask me and our children are suffering for it does n't make up for all we 've lost
there are some wonderful reasons to add the newly the best of everything '' to your film library for one it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into new york city circa 1959. fox certainly has done a commendable job with the dvd the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by deluxe brought to sparkling life the film is very very lush from the beginning when the screen fills with a sunny view of the manhattan skyline to the sounds of johnny mathis crooning the theme song you know you are in for grand entertainment all of the performances are fine with crawford a standout i think it 's funny that although joan crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in the best of everything '' her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the dvd the casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own ! that 's star power ! as enjoyable as the film is it is incredibly flawed if one was interested in sexist attitudes concerning men and women and how they have changed since the there could n't be a more relevant movie to watch it is shocking and sometimes disturbing how much attitudes have changed for example at one point during the movie catherine played by lovely hope lange is told by david one of her romantic interests that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world which in his view could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition she should quit it all get married and love happily ever after '' now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after but it certainly represents a who would ever tell a man such a thing could you imagine hope lange telling david that a man 's ambition is only him trying to prove himself and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after now i can imagine joan crawford saying that to clark gable but there were n't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film so much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated and some of it is very disturbing but there are still some good things about the story there are some great viewpoints on love and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people and my favorite line has to be here 's to men with their faces and their dirty little minds '' it 's funny to say the least !
yes please take me back to 1959 to new york in 1959 or even back to rio de janeiro a couple of years before where i met rona jaffe practically every single night at the then sacha 's '' nightclub where rona was already drafting her novel mentally when the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the seagram 's building one could actually to lovely suzy parker and chat with her about how real was the new morality '' of the liberated new york girls in the executive suites decades before sex and the city became the of the sexual revolution of the sixties at night we had the many parties thrown by negulesco and his charming wife while stephen boyd was being charming to my wife brazilian actress mariza woodward featured in life magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in rio oh yes take me back ! and if you were not there then if you were not even born then do get this dvd and visit new york 1959 and see how charmingly it all started despite where it eventually ended
as a young white boy growing up on the navajo reservation was very wonderful this movie brought back many wonderful memories the navajo friends i had all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of northern arizona this movie is a great movie it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880 's some what as i felt when we moved to northern arizona in 1960. the people were wonderful to grow up with this movie is a great movie the only problem i had with the dvd is that to see the bonus features you have to have a special computer i would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie if they could have just put it on the dvd i would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts other wise i would have given this movie a 5 star rating
love this movie caught some of it on tv one week so then did a search on amazon and brought the movie family entertainment loosly based on the real life frank t hopkins who did more to save the wild mustang than any other
hidalgo is based upon a true story so it 's no wonder it 's thrilling truth being stranger than fiction and all although it 's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened frank hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great bedouin horse race of the middle east known as the ocean of fire '' in the 1890 's this wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours yet never bores and your interest should never waver the international cast is terrific led by viggo mortensen in a subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a cowboy ' we 've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering john wayne to the laconic clint eastwood but with viggo 's frank hopkins we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke and it 's all the more interesting because frank hopkins is n't all cowboy half of him is native american this internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to hopkins balancing the tensions of native americans with the us government of the time the film explores frank hopkin 's journey between two worlds that of a half native american with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in wild bill hickcock 's show all while having to live in the white man 's world when he 's invited to participate in the bedouin race frank soon discovers there 's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions where women must hide their faces behind veils much like he 's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action with fun and authenticity viggo must have definitely lived '' horses for the film irregardless of his prior expertise with them he clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he 's totally capable and always convincing hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a tv series this beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it 's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance apparently lost by audiences in it 's initial theatrical release hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover
surprisingly ' released in did n't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings or audience appeal only now two years after its release is this fantastic film finding on dvd the adoring audience it so richly deserves i was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time i have come to the following conclusion it was all aragorn 's fault yes that 's correct it was aragorn 's fault here are the reasons why i believe this to be true ' was viggo mortensen 's first film following his role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of lord of the rings ' his long matted hair scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer the shock of seeing viggo as frank hopkins american cowboy in a funny hat and bandana much shorter cropped hair clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful ' to handle viggo 's fan base simply was n't ready to give up the image of the king of yet unable to accept the new look people stayed away from the theaters thus turning disney 's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error to put it plan and simple ' came out too soon if you 're finally willing to move beyond the aragorn persona and see a fast moving well acted beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell i invite you to give ' a viewing viggo is perfect as the half indian half white man who rides the little pinto that never gives up and omar sharif delivers his best performance since of arabia ' he 's alert witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh sometimes whimsical sheikh riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the american wild west it 's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part also excellent performances by zuleikha robinson as jazira adoni maropis as sakr and a whole cast of exotic fascinating characters participating in the torturous mile desert horse race across the ocean of fire '' highly recommended
the lord of the rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money but without the awards and critical recognition of the lotr movies not so with viggo mortensen right after lotr he followed with this awesome adventure story by disney coming out the summer after pirates of the caribbean this was supposed to be disney 's next big summer adventure hit unfortunately it flopped at the box office luckily it has made a comeback on the dvd market which is where this reviewer saw it all in all it is a great movie and probably one of the best movies disney has produced in a long while judging from its ratings here on amazon and on in short this movie is about frank hopkins american horserider who is mired in guilt and self remorse along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery a trip to the arabian desert for a race frank takes the challenge with his horse hidalgo and of they go the race across the arabian desert tests both rider and horse and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like disney could have created we have the girl full of innocence and inner strength a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs an arrogant prince with no moral bounds etc etc it all reminds our protagonist of his days in montana ! during the course of the race which frank and hidalgo win of course both of them are tested to the limit the movie ends on a triumphal note for both the rider redeems his guilt by freeing hidalgo from human ownership forever and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals the soundtrack is awesome the cinematography is great the dialogue is realistic and for once a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area ! my compliments to disney and the cast and crew of this movie i highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up
in this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of frank hopkins viggo mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether frank hopkins actually existed is irrelevant what is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted frank hopkins is an accomplished rider he has been a dispatch rider for the army a pony express rider and he has been in buffalo bill 's wild west show frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile ocean of fire a race that has been held for one thousand years after the obligatory refusal all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero he travels by sea to the middle east a side note the movie begins with the infamous wounded knee massacre the memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts frank i will discuss these distractions more later in this review this movie finally comes into its own when the ocean of fire race begins several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race numerous attempts are made to kill frank during the race of course frank manages to survive all these attempts he also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess and to save his horse from spikes big cats and bullets not to mention heat thirst and hunger nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining the title of the movie comes from the mustang named hidalgo hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie the only issue i had with this movie was the distractions i thought the wounded knee massacre while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie to be a distraction from the race even though frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were i also thought the release of the wild mustangs by frank could have been handled more succinctly though i admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the midwest was inspiring throwing in all the details about jazira the daughter of sheikh riyadh played by the great omar sharif were further distractions the result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly i thought viggo mortenson was great as aragorn in the lord of the rings movies he does an equally good job as frank hopkins enjoy the race enjoy the rescue of the princess fast forward through the rest
i have to say that i really enjoyed this film it is well done and not to mention beautifully shot it has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of hollywood these days most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed this film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint if you love horses adventure beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse then please do see it and lets face it ladies viggo mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him he is a very good actor and an underated one at that so sit back pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure and admire one of god 's most majestic creations horse and viggo mortensen ! !
here 's an epic '' movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid such as zhivago and lawrence of arabia interesting to note that omar sharif was in this movie and zhivago several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because thanks to the previews they thought it would be an adventure story such as the mummy '' well it was n't and it was way too slow for them frankly i thought the slow '' parts were the best and overall thought the film had just the right amount of action instead of overdoing it as the recent mummy pictures did another big plus was the cinematography this is a beautifully filmed movie stunning in some parts another good point is the language hardly a swear word on the negative side there was the usual political correctness a la dances with wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at wounded knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys the horse race had some credibility problems too as hidalgo '' came back from the dead not once but twice to race like secretariat ! anyway if you are looking for a adventure story with storytelling and no language problems this film is for you and the rest of the family
this is a very entertaining movie with the horse stealing the show of course i also like that it is based on a real person
3 stars for the movie plus a bonus star to the director for being a genius how you ask it 's all about paul walker man do i love that guy absolute worst actor in hollywood but still gets part after part his acting style is like a piece of wood with constipation but he 's just bad enough to be lovable people still like him despite his failing not like hayden christenson anakin from star wars who just needs to die anyways so the director is sitting and thinking hmmm paul walker 's in this movie how do i distract people from his god awful acting enough so they 'll still like it '' then the answer hits him like a sledge hammer to the head get a super ridiculously hot woman to play along side him ! enter jessica alba in a bikini think any guy is watching paul walker any more and that handles half the audience at least now if that is n't enough we also have pirates sharks mantas and other sea creatures who consequently get addicted to cocaine and lots of underwater shots of our illustrious stars diving for treasure drugs also putting paul walker underwater for much of the film erases the need for him to talk bonus
into the blue turned out to be a decent movie i was not expecting a story or anything from this movie other than pure eye candy i was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography the underwater shots are really breathtaking i also enjoyed the special features on the dvd which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested of course aside from the beautiful underwater photography there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world jessica alba looks incredible ashley scott is also gorgeous and for the ladies there 's paul walker and tyson beckford i was n't expecting much from this film but i was pleasantly surprised it 's not going to win any academy awards but it is entertaining and fun
this movie had a better story than i expected the action was pretty good and of course jessica
if you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan like i am of jessica alba this film is worth buying i did n't see this film at the theater but after renting it i immeadiately bought it you can read the other reviews here from the who pan the film but the bottom line here is was the film entertaining the answer to that question is yes ! the reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained and this film delivers ! if you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained i guarantee you will enjoy this film
finally a good remake that is a little different what makes a movie is the scenery least my opinion scenery was beautiful but the deep was a classic but the updated version is good for the new age crowd which makes sens
jared paul walker and sam jessica alba are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the bahamas waiting for that day when they 'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems when jared 's old friend bryce scott caan arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship zephyr unfortunately the zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine cocaine its owner james frain wants back into the blue has great acting good directing great special effects and good writing let me start off with saying i definitely prefer paul walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves i 'm right the acting in this film has got to be its strongest point jessica alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and paul walker does a great job as well scoot cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk ! the special effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff the writing and directing were also very good but i believe the acting stood out the most overall if you like jessica alba or paul walker or underwater adventures you 'll love this movi
jessica 's imagine the same film as the deep '' with jacqueline bisset a real sexy looking woman not a teenager chica lookalike '' with very poor seems the same director had a better choice in blue crush '' the rest is absolutly great and represents a great moment of adventures buy i
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick the deep '' which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let 's face it ! the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day
i actually took the kids to see this movie and it was entertaining for the whole family it had everything for all ages family friendly with a lesson for everyone being a weekend parent i have to utilise the time with my grommits because in a few years they will be turning into their terrible teens thats the years they start thinking they know everything and hanging out with their old man wo n't be cool anymore adam 's movies are so family friendly that my kids always enjoy the night outs
i am a person who mostly avoids mainstream movies due to violence hollywood messages that do n't match up with my values with that said i 'd have to say this movie was definitely worthwhile my husband convinced me to take a look i was n't disappointed i wo n't repeat what others have said but click forces you to think about your own choices in life the simple message is this appreciate people not things maybe that topic makes a lot of folks uncomfortable not sure why else people would n't like the movie i say if you want a movie with a positive message do n't mind examining your own heart in the process check it out
in click '' adam sandler stars as michael newman an overworked underappreciated architect who 's let his job replace his family fed up with not receiving his fair share at work and knowing that he 's about to lose his family newman snaps decides that his family needs a universal remote just like everybody else and hurries out of his house and into the only store that 's open that evening bed bath and beyond what he finds in the beyond way beyond section of the store is morty christopher walken a sales clerk who gives him a universal remote that 's a tad bit unusual it controls every facet of his life he can skip over watching his dog violate a stuffed duck mute his wife during arguments and basically bypass any of the moments of his life in order to get to the good stuff unfortunately skipping over so much of his life means that newman misses the small things that make life worth living and the big things that make life either grand or miserable in short this flick is a play on the christmas classic it 's a wonderful life '' with the typical sandler spin however unlike many reviewers have stated i do n't think that the toilet humor that sandler 's accused of using in most of his past films is too distracting in this one the first half of the film is rather humorous thanks to a wonderful supporting cast which includes henry winkler julie kavner sean astin and the breathtaking kate beckinsale david hasselhoff and jennifer coolidge also throw in some funny performances it 's the second half of the film that really makes click '' click as sandler 's character ages he begins to realize that he 's not that great of a guy he also comes to find out that there are things in life that seem rather dull until you lose them overall this is a decent flick it 's more deserving of three and a half stars than four but i 'll round up based on the second half of the film it does drag at times but it 's all worth it recommended as a strong rental for casual sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things sandler
it probably wo n't take the smartest person to realize that my review of a adam sandler movie wo n't be the most unbiased review out there considering my nickname but much like his other past dumb comedies click made into my dvd library but unlike his previous movies sandler does n't play the lovable loser instead he is a fairly successful architect who close to making partner and he already has the girl in the form of kate beckinsale serendipity who seems to like to walk around in pajama short shorts and tight fitting shirt okay so not everything is perfect as he is having trouble balancing his family and doing enough at work to be made partner the pressure culminates when he has to do research on asian architecture so he can land a prestigious japanese client only to turn on a remote control car while trying to play a video on the subject so it 's time to a universal remote so he does n't open his garage door every time he tries to turn on the television but the only place that is open at the time is bed bath and beyond where sandler has to venture into the beyond where he runs into the last person you want to meet at the end of a dark hallway cowbell himself christopher walken as anyone who saw the trailer can figure up the remote that walken gives sandler is truly a universal remote as it gives sandler the power to control his whole universe he can fast forward threw fights with his wife mute annoying people and pause to kick someone in the crotch without them knowing hey it 's an adam sandler movie you need your prerequisite object to the crotch no remote control gag goes unused well except for close captioning but anyways unfortunately for sandler the remote comes with tivo so it starts predicting his habits and starts to fast forwards even when he does n't want to do so and unfortunately for us as sandler goes further in the future the sappier the movie gets and almost plays out like a christmas carol with walken playing all three ghosts but luckily there are plenty of fart jokes and other sophomoric gags that you would expect from a sandler movie that keeps the sappy parts from being unwatchable plus sandler brings in some of his past coworker who knock the comedy out of the park including the fonz the waterboy sean austin 50 first dates terry crews the longest yard and of course rob schneider who seems to pop up in every of his movie but you will have to look in the deleted scenes to hear his catchphrase you can do it ! '' the best cameo though goes to james earl jones who you will just have to see the movie to see how he is used but when it comes down to it if you love sandler you will love this movie but if you 're not you are complete and total tool and need to get a sense of humor
everyone is expecting the happy madison adam sandler of ten years ago adam has grown up the movie actually has a great plot and has some laugh out loud moments are you going to be rolling on the floor by the time the movie is over no but are you going to get caught up in the story of the movie and put yourself in his shoes as the plot moves on absolutely it 's one of his best movies and a ca n't miss
as the head honcho of i have watched well over 200 films and give why we fight '' my highest recommendation this needs to be shown on prime time television if it was it would prompt a thunderous public outcry for badly needed government military reforms it covers facts that many do n't know about the united states like our penchant for endless involvement in military actions over seas the film 's launching pad is the infamous eisenhower farewell speech in which he warns america of the growing military industrial complex then in a unique and compelling style it pinpoints famous people places and moments in time with candid footage and revealing quotes it also delves into the personal perspectives of a few ordinary citizens affected by 11 and the resulting occupation of iraq it visits key players in government and exposes what really drives the war machine it looks at military contractors and congress and their incestuous relationship it also reveals the much too influential role the so called think tanks play in crafting our national policy in addition the soundtrack features some great musical talent the information presented in this film is something every american should know but they do n't know it for the most part because the people who want those war wheels turning do n't want the people to know what they 're doing or why it seems the war minded even believe the people do not have any need to know the people beg to differ why we fight '' is on my personal top ten most important movies list which is why it would be a great gift informing people is the kind of gift really worth giving
1. it 's extremely elementary you could read for 10 minutes on wikipedia source watch or a seymour hersh article and get more substantive information 2. it 's manipulative the music in particular is far too emotionally leading in a contrived and obvious way this film does not try to be subtle like the thin blue line 3. it 's incredibly patronizing towards members of the military and those interested in military technologies or tactics insinuating they are all white country sheeple it is certainly true that many of those we get geeky about are not the incredibles we make them out to be hell i 've met fighter pilots and delta force who sounded like brainwashed morons without an original idea in their entire heads but the film went a bit far with this theme 4. i had the sense the interviews and sources it is relying on are fairly limited you see pretty much the same few people over and over again for the entire length of the film this does n't give the impression of a wide variety of parallel 5. this documentary was oddly simplistic in a number of ways and left out many key pieces of information its density was lite considering it is a full length film this is not an episode of frontline why was n't brazil on the map of covert ops to overthrow democratic governments for corporate purposes why did they show the first gulf war as justifiable and honest there was at least as much distortion propaganda spinning and out and out psychological warfare pr going on against the american people during gulf war 1 to show another very clear trend and why we fight '' was interested in trends it was still quite good and it 's a nice source of vomit by like perle and provocateurs like kristol both who are currently trying to pretend themselves back into the mainstream by now opposing the policies they pushed so hard for in the first place i also think the circular referencing back onto the characters such as the was well done and moving so in conclusion i 'm glad i watched it and why we fight '' is an excellent primer for those who have no idea what is going on but it is not a truly great documentary
this film should be seen and discussed in classrooms and small gatherings across the country kmoor
i ca n't recall ever seeing a more thoughtful documentary on the most recent of our nation 's military efforts what separates the american experience from that of almost every other empire '' throughout history is the fact that critics of our government are allowed to voice their opposing views efforts by some to paint a message like this as are disengenuous and downright wrong beginning with dwight eisenhower 's farewell address that warned of the danger posed by a complex the filmmakers build an intriguing case of both pros and cons associated with much of american military efforts over the past 50 years yes it has a largely critical view of the quagmire that is the iraq war but that 's hardly unique these days two participants stand out in my mind one is the retired new york policeman whose response to his son 's death in the world trade center attack was to request that a bomb be labeled with the name of his son as time elapsed and information came to light his view regarding the war changed dramatically does he approve of the war now no ! does he regret his effort to memorialize his son still no although he qualifies that with the notation that he was operating with the information available at that time would he do that again i doubt it the other noteworthy player in this ensemble is senator john mccain who may very well use his participation in this work to woo political moderates should he make a run for the white house in 2008. his expression of his ideas and reactions underscore his basic decency and indepence from the current administration in marked contrast to some of his more recent efforts to pander to the fundamentalist right wing of the republican party this is an excellent documentary one that i suspect will easily withstand the test of time and be just as interesting from 10 to 20 years from now
this documentary is absolutely really providing a powerful and honest look into how war has been waged in the modern era demonstrating how the american public has been lied to and given propaganda in modern wars as opposed to just giving them unbiased and truthful information and coverage and giving the viewer an idea of how war has become more and more about imperialism and over time it was also fascinating to note that the original words in president eisenhower 's great farewell address were actually the complex '' but that he changed it so that he would n't alienate congress whom he 'd gotten along pretty well with during his two terms it 's also a surprise to hear such a stinging indictment of military buildup and such a strong warning to exercise military power justly coming from someone who was a general a career officer and a republican to boot sadly we have n't heeded his wise parting words to us the same way we have n't paid heed to president washington 's farewell address in which he similarly warned us against getting involved in foreign entanglements and in not abusing our military strength or the nation 's great ability to do good instead of evil i 've always thought eisenhower was a lousy president though a great general one of my presidents but my opinion of him was raised a bit after hearing his farewell address and finding out his feelings about the dangerous road the military and warfare were taking after wwii as well as how he was against the dropping of the on japan however this film can seem a bit uneven as compelling and indisputable as the evidence it presents is though it claims to trace the evolution of modern warfare and the bloated military buildup since wwii it 's shocking how much the spends for defence in comparison with all other nato nations and even enemies like china and iran and how the government and media have successfully used propaganda to manipulate public opinion to be and to not question or protest these actions a lot of the focus seems to be on the current iraq war with some time given over to vietnam as well an awful lot of conflicts were glossed over or not even delved into such as korea bosnia kosova afghanistan lebanon laos columbia guatemala and chile the historical perspective and the film 's theme and conclusion would have been even stronger and more compelling had there been equal focus on these other conflicts instead of just brushing them aside in favor of the two that most people already have heard a lot about extras include an audio commentary by lawrence wilkerson and director eugene jarecki a trailer previews for other documentaries put out by the same company extra scenes television appearances made by jarecki question and answer sessions he held with various groups he spoke to and extended featurettes telling us more about some of the characters we met this film can hardly be accused of being since many of the people interviewed have either served or are currently serving in the military i 'm a strong pacifist and conscientious objector myself and i 'm not either like the people interviewed i agree that we need a strong and prepared military for those times when conflict is inevitable and there are wars which i absolutely feel to have been morally justified such as wwii and the civil war wars it would have been immoral to have not fought and the military should stay and be equal opportunity so that people from the poor and many of them minorities wo n't be so hugely represented in favor of white people from higher socioeconomic brackets people who have historically been able to get out of serving because of their family 's money and connections the young people like william solomon who voluntarily go in should know ahead of time what they 're getting into and if they 're deployed know just what they 're supposed to be fighting for instead of being misled and outright lied to by the government this documentary in spite of its unevenness should be required viewing for every concerned citizen out there maybe then we 'll see some change in the complex
empire building carries a cost what will it cost america in the end it has been noted that there seems to be a pattern where the very recognizition that an empire exists is the beginning of its collapse may we recognize it for what it is before we have too far to fall once again we are haunted by the better angels of our past men who warned us about the cost of not being vigilant too long we have been asleep at last there is a wakeup call may we not ignore it
i 'm giving why we fight '' 4 stars for its uniqueness and having good intentions but could have given it a 3 for being somewhat 'dumbed down ' and uneven in content hours or days could be spent analyzing what the film could have been compared to what it is for starters wwf spends most of its time concentrating on the current iraq war and the lies used to sell that war to the us public it makes a half hearted attempt to give some background of america 's tragic history in the arab world but never once mentions us long term funding diplomatic support and the military arming of israel with us weaponry meanwhile perhaps 20 mins or more is spent listening to a ny father of a son killed on explain how he was taken in by the bush administration 's nonsense regarding wmd 's and sadam 's fictitious connections this is followed by his later surprise and outrage when he finds that the obviously false pretense is indeed false the movie does n't really have the courage to delve into the most contentious and dangerous aspects of why we fight but eats up time on a personal story that while somewhat compelling is mainly irrelevant this is what i mean by the 'dumbing down ' aspect of the documentary another area wwf gets sloppy with is the seeming lumping together of various us actions into one wwf bucket bosnia and kosovo are tossed into the bucket as red warzone spots on the map along with everything else as if all us military actions are the product of rightwing think tanks and nothing is said regarding us inaction rwanda or the picking and choosing of to let loose with 'shock awe ' the level of cold war overreaction sheer numbers of unconventional us stockpiles would have helped make the point of the money making business interests in the arms industry but is never really mentioned some of the special features especially ike 's evolution '' are more interesting than the edited film in that they give a fuller historical background of how we got here and how a relatively few misguided zealots could find themselves with the military means to actually do the unthinkable invade iraq since there is so precious little that even attempts to inspect our state of affairs wwf is worth viewing but it is nowhere close to the level of documentary skill that a typical pbs frontline episode has
a very good movie kiss the girls sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in north carolina there are slight hints of seven the bone collector resurrection and the silence of the lambs so the movie falls into the type of category though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror morgan freeman ashley judd who is gorgeous ! and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well ! overall though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening 's entertainment
this is a great thriller simply that and i was really surprised by it i do n't know why i spurned it when it was out in theatres maybe because rosie o'donnell gave away who the killer was on one of her interviews and i love her but why give away the big surprise of whodunit if i had n't known who the killer was i would 've been floored during the final act as it was it was suspensefully done many folks have covered the ligistics of the tale in their reviews so i wo n't rehash it here i 'll just say i was really impressed with the acting and the camera work so cool ! everyone gives an excellent performance and the pacing of the film is well done lots of action ! my only beef was with the very ending i would 've liked a little more of a resolution so i 'll probably check out the book to see how james patterson wraps things up good film all in all suspenseful
i recently saw an excellent romantic comedy kiss the girls 1997 starring morgan freeman and ashley judd freeman stars as alex cross a talented boxing coach who falls breathlessly in love with young physician kate mctiernan beautifully played by judd both alex and kate are recovering from messy divorces when they first meet at the caf nocturnal a cozy little dive on the west side of los angeles after a great deal of verbal sparring they begin to things get hot and heavy real quick ! there is an adorable scene in which freeman and judd shovel dollops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream into each other 's mouths proving that racial and generational differences are relative and unimportant the film is about love 's magical ability to cross boundaries and contains oodles of chemistry between freeman and judd notably when the latter gives the former a back massage not to be missed !
this movie is about a detective alex cross who is struggiling to figure out the mind of a serial kidnapper and murderer who goes by the name of case becomes even more pressing when cross 's neice is taken by 's only help of finding cassanova and rescuing his neice is cassanova 's kidnapping victim the one that got away this is a movie with great twists and turns it stars two great actors morgan freeman and ashley judd the story is great and the ending is unbelieveable
hot babes kidnapped blah blah blah this is a spellbinding suspenseful thriller with more than one twist so have an extra bag of popcorn ready for the microwave because your eyes will be glued to the screen this movie is all about the viewer trying to keep up as the detective negotiates the maze of clues and distractions morgan freeman is the reason i watched this movie loved it ! every time there 's an alex cross '' available i watch it driving miss daisy seven high crimes shawshank redemption glory million dollar baby and all those many other movies are excellent still morgan freeman as the outright leading character are the height of entertainment ! just get all the alex cross detective '' movies starring morgan freeman available and watch them four or five times the movies share titles with novels but do n't let that delay your viewing an avid reader i had never heard of james patterson until i had seen kiss the girls '' and along came a spider '' thus i had the benefit of not being concerned as to whether the movie script followed the novel to the letter who cares ! if they differ it is most likely because duh one is a movie while the other is a book reviewers who complain about the differences must not understand that what makes a good chocolate cake does n't quite make a good chocolate ice cream to achieve the same flavor you 've got to change some key ingredients morgan freemam made the character alex cross worth watching when you need an actor to literally carry a movie you 've got to get someone with a reputation for doing the heavy lifting freeman has long since done that in driving miss daisy '' recently though i do n't know why he bothered to do it unless as a personal favor to his friend clint eastwood freeman did all the hard work again in million dollar baby '' come on folks i like eastwood as much as anyone but there 's a reason he 's been directing movies and not acting in them for decades now and mdb '' is a painful example hilary swank well if you get packaged '' between eastwood 's direction and freeman 's acting cleary people will mistake you for an actress ! at least partially reminds me of driving miss daisy when you search dvds '' for morgan freeman '' it lists 'related searches ' as denzel washington '' mel gibson '' and tom hanks '' those guys are listed as related to morgan freeman ! you should really see this movie and also see along came a spider '' which i 've also reviewed
this was a very good you in suspense all through the usual ashley judd and morgan freeman gave a superb this movie if like will like it
i received my purchase quickly and in good condition it was cheaper than buying it at a store and i had very little waiting time
on the lines of wag the dog but nowhere near as powerfully is 15 minutes the basic undercurrent of the movie is the theme of media its influence on people and the kind of perceptions distortions that it can create somewhere at least in the screenplay there is a bit of lampooning of the usofa not just the way the media controls people but also in the aspect of the legal systems the double jeopardy law the unable to stand trial '' on grounds of insanity and stuff having said that the movie does provide a sharp look into media its effects in one dimension in the backdrop of this scenario comes yet another strong performance by de niro burns the characters are well fleshed out and played quite well by their cast the liberal smattering of czech russian influences gives the movie an interesting twist and therein is threaded the plot two guys coming to the us as tourists and trying to make it rich quick by beating the system there are elements of the movie which are cliched trite which tend to take away from a serious theme but in the interest of 'masala ' viewability i guess these foibles can be passed over and the movie enjoyed well 15 minutes definitely worth a watch slightly violent though
this is more realistic then some may admit you see it all the time in the stories on tv reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is best example is michael jackson everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side that is what this movie is all about the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders the plot was pretty original i do n't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie almost to the point of overwhelming but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi storylines are a bit different but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story
15 minutes is a horrifying and gritty peek into the injustice of the american legal system and also the news media wow two digs in one film how can you resist emil slovak a czech national played by karel rodan and his friend oleg razgul a russian national played by oleg taktarov who met in prague decide to travel to america the land of opportunity emil wants to hunt down his old crime partner who took all the money from the robbery he was jailed for but oleg is infatuated with american cinema and wants be a filmmaker immediately upon arriving oleg steals a video camera from a store and they are off to confront emil 's old partner and get their money back but while oleg films the event emil discovers that his portion of the money was already spent and he kills his friend and friend 's wife unfortunately there was someone else watching the murder daphne handlova had been staying with her friends and fled the apartment after witnessing the murders an illegal alien herself she does not want for the police or the killers to find her but leaves her purse behind in the apartment where emil discovers who she is the apartment is burned to cover the bodies a bohemian barbeque '' says oleg which calls in not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming robert de niro but fire marshal jordy warsaw edward burns to the scene emil and oleg get away but while emil obsesses with finding daphne oleg obsesses about filming their trip to america '' killings and all he believes he is making the greatest movie ever they begin to watch new york 's hot and exploitive news show called top story '' anchored by shady robert hawkins played expertly by kelsey grammer these three men flemming warsaw and hawkins become irresistible targets to emil and oleg the two psychopaths believing that controlling and taunting these famous men will give them the recognition they desire i do n't want to give away too much of the plot but suffice to say that there is a brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough a cop he is and hawkins will reveal himself as slimiest snake in the media industry and emil will learn enough to know that insanity can set him free even if he is caught there is action from beginning to end in this movie a tight and somewhat confusing plot at times some great acting from both the stars and the supporting cast including a great character played by david alan grier there is seediness and wretchedness and hopelessness and an ending that makes the film come together quite nicely if you are ready for a little brutal cop action in your life give 15 minutes a try enjoy !
15 minutes is worth the money it probably will not be the number one dvd in your collection but you 're sure to go back and watch it from time to time this film gives an interesting if not frightening look at the role play in our country 's daily life we do n't think about it since we are living it but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today at the center of the movie 's plot is a greedy slick style anchor who is given the 'gift ' of being the only personality in town to have the footage of a string of murders as they are being committed he has a moral pause only for a second before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world the rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them all in not the best movie out but worth the money
the mothman prophecies '' is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films i 've ever seen i only saw this once and that was awhile ago but i do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been richard gere yeah i know plays a washington post reporter named john klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident after the accident which is purposely filmed so that we do n't know how or why it really happened his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth she keeps asking klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not a kind of figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable at first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on will patton has to be the best actor in this movie he plays gordon smallwood outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses when klein shows up at gordon 's house and has a rifle shoved in his face it is not by accident nothing in this movie really is the way pellington shoots the scenes of gordon losing his mind is unforgettable it happens in a fizzy weird video game type way which comes off very vividly i 've never liked laura linney too much and have always felt she belongs on tv but she does a decent job as connie mills the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for klein 's breakdowns as the real star of the movie indrid cold keeps calling him only in the exorcist '' or black christmas '' perhaps have i seen a movie before in which a creepy otherworldly voice becomes the star even when klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone it keeps ringing and ringing this is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope the climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless bottom line every horror fan should see this
i just read dirk 's spolier '' ending to the mothman prophecies and had to say huh demonic fallen angles what did we watch the same movie if all you go by is the movie that might be the impression you 're left with but if you 've ever looked into the events that happened around point pleasant or any of the books on the subject you 'll see that the mothman was more ufo related than anything at same time of the mothman sightings the point pleasant area was in a wave of ufo reports and all sorts of up in the sky in fact mothman played only a very small part in the drama it was by far predominately ufo related as keel makes clear unfortunately the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely and so the happenings at point pleasant lost their entire frame of reference if you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened you might come to the conclusion of the mothman being evil demonic fallen angles whatever you like but if you research the incident at all you 'll see you 're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie and if like dirk you thereby think you know all about what mothman actually was based on just the movie alone then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a hollywood writer 's imagination and script and nothing more mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be do n't judge by the movie read the book
i was scared of the dark after watching this last night ! the acting scenery and special effects were all wonderful from the very beginning you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia sp of klein 's unravelling life is the mothman real or not klein 's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics angels premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows otoh i didnt care for the ending too staged
the mothman prophecies is a throwback to the time when horror movie '' did n't actually mean teenage gore fest '' i guess the word for it now would be 'thriller ' and thrill it does based on a true story from point pleasant west virginia in 1967 the mothman takes place in present 2001 or thereabouts it 's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor there he stumbles across several bizarre occurances namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a ethereal creature and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter 's own life the director mark pellington whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie arlington road and the music video of jeremy '' by pearl jam has created a mood and a tension in film that i do n't think has appeared since the exorcist in 1973. and he does so without blood gore or cheap scares and only a rating pellington falls backs on some outdated tricks '' like good acting excellent cinematography and an absolutely stunning soundtrack of the actors ' faces here convey more real terror than in all the friday the films combined the musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale dark and foreboding tense and pensive sound work this good should have earned an oscar nomination the camera work is beyond reproach as well sometimes long shots setting a mood sometimes jerky fuzzy or distorted like a funhouse mirror all perfect to what needs to be conveyed without giving away too much the acting also is top notch richard gere laura linney will patton and will grace 's debra messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime if there is a flaw to the mothman prophecies it 's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences a moments ' hesitation a shifting away of the eyes the use of a voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive and added only a minute or two to the films ' overall length counting memento this is the second great film i 've seen in the past thirteen months get it while you can rating solid a although this film is rated only it may be too scary or intense for children 15 and under
the mothman prophecies '' is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works ' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art richard gere plays john klein a journalist for the washington post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife he soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of point pleasant west virginia he develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant played by laura linney they soon learn that many of the town 's residents have sighted an eerie entity similar to the one klein 's wife saw before she died deeper investigation causes klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature he becomes convinced that the being exists on a sphere far beyond humanity 's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities in fact he comes to realize that this mothman '' is trying to warn the small town of one can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure can he save his life and his loved ones before it 's too late the mothman prophecies '' is not a monster movie nor is it a horror flick it 's a creepy story with loads of mood atmosphere every element of this motion picture skillfully works acting story editing score cinimatography locations etc sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent beautiful quality to the film the ending is touching in a very powerful way i 'll put it this way if you appreciated the village '' you 'll love this one the notable amazon reviewer lawrence bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and indeed can not be figured out this is completely untrue one must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate many questions are raised with varying possible answers do n't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film they 're all there but you may have to watch it about four or five times to finally discover them i appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer even allowing room for complete misinterpretation if the viewer wants answers must have ears to hear '' and be willing to work for them my initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans in a nutshell my interpretation was that the mothman '' brought gere to point pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife who died due to a condition that only the mothman knew about this explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen '' are good in nature i 've come to see that this translation is false a brilliantly implemented red herring spoiler alert do n't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen the mothmen are in truth evil spirits fallen angels or demons they 're synonymous this is clear when viewing drawings of the creatures these pictures never show beautiful beings but rather disturbing a mothman evil spirit caused the auto accident that injured debra messing would a good angelic being cause such a tragedy regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a problem the bible calls satan the prince of the power of the air '' hence his underlings demons are spiritual and in nature they can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that 's not plugged in they can even take human form like the male nurse who insists debra 's drawings are of angels '' and then mysteriously vanishes or mimic the voices of dead loved ones the researcher from chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives they may seem to be benevolently warning humans but at the same time are obvious instigators of human tragedies the car crash gordon 's job loss insanity ultimate demise and the researcher 's loss of his family a respectable social life also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions they are highly skilled masqueraders the reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millenia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate deceive and destroy the saved police woman number 37 '' research that number in the end is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with gere and linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive the film powerfully reveals that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal the only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with god through jesus christ 's blood shield of atonement not that the movie ever reveals this for more intriguing insights see sam damon 's outstanding review from october 27 2002 end spoiler alert '' mothman '' ranks up there with my favorite movies
this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since do n't look now back in this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense
i watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole mothman phenomenon so fortunately was n't in a position to have my expectations dashed i guess that 's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events and there 's not much that can be done about it if you 've already read up on the whole incident the movie should be taken for what it is a good spine chilling paranormal thriller the special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the mothman sightings on which the movie is based very interesting in its own right
kitty foyle '' is a provocative depiction of class and gender politics during the era preceding world war ii in america the film bluntly displays how your happiness could be impeded by your station in life and if you are a woman it 's that much harder there are no real villains in the piece other than the archaic mores set down for generations interesting though based on a novel by christopher morley the script was adapted by dalton trumbo who would later be blacklisted ginger rogers in a performance of great strength and nuance more than earned her oscar for her work here those who would dismiss her as fred astaire 's dance partner should check out her work in films like street '' and stage door ''
ginger rogers was very popular both within the hollywood community and with the moviegoing public with two strong performances in 1940 she took home the oscar despite strong competition rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every american girl who worked for a living her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman 's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless sam wood directed this very entertaining film based on christopher morley 's popular book ginger is kitty foyle a career girl from philadelphia who falls for her boss wyn strafford dennis morgan in what she thinks is everything she 's dreamed about all her life wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to kitty 's flashbacks of their romance just as george stevens had used a phonograph in penny serenade the previous year kitty and wyn are no longer together their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to kitty that her irish american moxie can not overcome wyn 's family in their darby mill griscom street romance kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by james craig but it is a down to earth and more practical love and when wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more but not as his wife she must decide which path to choose as she packs to run away with wyn she argues with her conscience and remembers ernest cossart is very good as kitty 's pop trying to steer her in the right direction he may have been born four drinks below par as kitty affectionately teases him but he is wise enough to see wyn 's weak character which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an american working girl trying to have it all rogers did deserve the oscar because she is everything in this film she may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940 's they viewed her as one of their own even though the glamour of hollywood was part of her story as well she was the american girl made good and her performance here is flawless a fine ending showed not only kitty 's irish american moxie but her growth and maturity as well this is a fine film with a terrific performance from ginger rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made a fine score from roy webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing a must own for ginger 's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection
ginger won the oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition she 's decidedly out of character as a girl with an old school attitude i love when she grumbles people always make a big deal about the old west and the brave women of the covered wagons they do n't seem to care as much about their equivalents the secretaries the women of the covered typewriters '' with her quivering lower lip and her chin she makes us care for kitty foyle a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy wynnewood strafford the iii or for short win '' played skillfully by the wonderful dennis morgan possibly hollywood 's most star player of the morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap some sort of weakness here his achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position gladys cooper would have a fit if she found out that dennis was dating ginger rogers and in the book of course kitty and win do n't get married but carry on a back street '' sex affair anyhow moviegoers even in were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby ginger loses in the movie was a real love child '' you 'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes like tears when ginger realizes that she has lost the baby luckily mark is there to pick up the pieces james craig another very good actor playing a young intern who loves kitty even despite the fact that her father 's a boozehound and she will never enter the social register or main line philly society i wonder if grace kelly ever saw kitty foyle and based some of her choices in men on kitty 's philadelphia binary between this film and bachelor mother you would think ginger rogers a very maternal figure but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side think lady in the dark '' probably the part she played that was the most like the real life ginger rogers '' the subtitle of this movie was the natural history of a woman '' and was supposed to provide a or sociological study of class far from it but it 's a treat anyhow
any best actress oscar winner of 1940 would have been controversial i think ginger deserved it as well as any of the others she is wonderful in this drama and she portrays kitty with a certain realness watch her facial expressions i believe that ginger had the most expressive and beautiful eyes in hollywood history after losing her baby in childbirth kitty 's look on her face whenever she sees a child afterwards is devestating the whole cast is fine and you could cut gin and dennis morgan 's chemistry with a knife ginger had a strange power to bring out so much chemistry from all her leading men in the early scenes she is adorable as little kitty i do n't believe that this is a soap opera because the situations are not ridiculous and the characters are very real but nevertheless it is a heavier type of drama so do n't expect a swing experience and keep the tissues handy i highly recommend this film not only for ginger 's performance but for the movie as a whole
i had never ever heard about this film till i found it by chance i realy liked the sadness that covered the whole film val kilmer is about to become my favourite actor and i liked the music of the film also if you have n't see it and i don n't think you have n't just dont miss it
danny parker is a meth addict and a snitch for the police as well he used to be tom van allen before the death of his wife in an unrelated drug raid near the salton sea from tom the trumpet player to danny the addict danny 's downward spiral has had a purpose with a single piece of evidence from the murder of his wife a red hair has planned revenge for a long time based on a single vision of a person at a gas station he intends to trap the stranger in a dollar drug deal with a psycho called i do n't want to say much more which would reveal too much of the plot but i will say that this film relies on atmosphere photography great acting and visuals rather than script i felt the script was the weakest part but the rest of its components compelled me towards its rather predictable ending it 's a bit twisted and unleveled but in the end that works for the movie rather than against it val kilmar willow alexander wonderland is good in his role as he always is but vincent d'onofrio men in black the cell steals the show as d'onofrio was meant to play the bad parts evidenced by his ability to carry the movie 'the cell ' all on his own lopez made the movie worse not better peter sarsgaard shattered glass the cell carries his share of the weight in this flick just as he did with d'onofrio in the cell these two actors obviously work well together look for singer meat loaf in an almost unrecognizable role as bo wong executive decision is at top form as his role of bubba 'the salton sea ' is a good movie to flesh out your drug habit as far as movies go but i have n't decided whether or not it is worth a purchase yet definitely worth a rent though plus you have to absolutely love that tattoo on danny ! enjoy !
this film may be well one the most original chilling powerful potent and gratifying american noir in years frame by frame this somber portrait about a man who lost his wife in an absurd skirmish because of both of them were in the wrong place at the wrong moment will induce him to plan a dark and meticulous vengeance that will lead him to become a talebearer to get to infiltrate in the underworld and so to gain the deserved trust to get close the expected target but in the meantime the journey is hard to be a piece of cake he will face the dense brume of the nasty jungle of dealers and corrupted officers but if you additionally consider the prodigious angle shots the overwhelming photography the surprising information around it the fine performances and the claustrophobic locations this sum will compensate by far all your efforts to get it rent it and even acquire for your personal collection a very well made razor edge thriller that will maintain you hold on your seat
starts off slow but makes up for it in the end it is a really great story val kilmer does a great job as usual
thanks for the fine actors for supporting this quirky violent film many of them play against type and vince creates an original sadistic dealer hopefully no one will try to emulate his sick torturing ways in real life basically the story is a mystery and the layers unfold as the story moves along in many ways it is a conventional mystery but with highly original characters kilmer does some of his best work and you have to wonder if his bad boy antics have affected his ability to get roles since he delivers such a great performance too bad this is such a litlle known film it deserves better
the salton sea is a dismal place and it 's metaphor for all the bad that happened in tom van allen 's val kilmer life it 's a modern film noir and kilmer does a good job in capturing the torment of a drug addict unforgettable characters and a dark glimpse into a world i knew nothing about except what i 've heard on 60 minutes and some very black humor the special features are especially enlightening with director caruso 's commentary check it out if you like independent films you wo n't be disappointed
excellence in the script is elusive and and the performances were precise the story is the strength of this film is accompanied by the examination of the soul which takes place throughout val kilmer 's predicament which is not completely shown at the beginning of the movie but in retrospect undoubtedly sets the stage for the entire film is i ca n't express enough the level to which i enjoyed the combination of 's performances and the script
this film reminded me a lot of casino '' interesting story appealing actors good sets dialog and costumes but they also share one more characteristic they both feature several souless sadistic characters who perform horrific acts of brutality the best thing about this movie is val kilmer i think he was in most if not every scene and he narrates the story all the way through i think kilmer has one of the most expressive voices of american actors working in film today so hearing him narrate was a treat ! he plays a sensitive musician in love with his beautiful adventurous wife and has the terrible misfortune of watching her being murdered just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time now full of grief he spends his days and nights bluffing his way through a bleak landscape of and in order to lay a trap for his wife 's killer the who just wants to be liked is also a great character his friendship with kilmer 's character is the heart of the movie other secondary characters are also good including the gun salesman and the two bad cops i give this story 4 stars because it is not something i would buy and watch over and over again the souless characters are just too much for a sensitive person to contemplate
before shooting the thriller 'taking lives ' featuring angelina jolie caruso gathered talented character actors or some of them are determined method actors for this stylish film noir shot in the sunny california the script is too complicated with flashbacks but for all its implausible story the film is always entertaining with a clever use of the camera and some interesting or crazy characters that you find it funny to see but you do n't want to know personally standard film review requires a plot summery but in 'the salton sea ' it does n't work so i strongly advise that if you like good dialogues and unpredictable story you should watch it without reading anything about the film including mine i can also promise some moments of darkly funny humor and strange characters including our hero running away from his demon plus good acting from val kilmer and vincent d'onofrio who has no nose and the moody photography by amir mokri 'do n't say a word ' and 'taking lives ' minor spoilers alert ! ! ! the film is a noir mystery which begins with val kilmer 's character sitting on the floor playing the trumpet somewhere in the burning house his languid voiceover tells us about the things in the past about the days when he was dealing with chemicals at first the film looks like a drama about some crime crimes are involved to be sure but the film soon shows another much darker aspect the film is partly a revenge story but its revenge part can not be revealed here apparently the film suggests val kilmer 's character has one aim right ahead of him he has a huge tatoo on his back he keeps in touch with two guys who are not always nice to him and he says he has two names but his real purpose of life will not be clear until the last 30 minutes complicated story if you dissect all the pages of the script rearrange the parts and see the whole thing once again you will notice that the story itself is very implausible the film knows it however and is even calling its own a 'cliche ' but perhaps the mystery is not the point it 's about how to present it and 'the salton sea ' succeeds on that score its humor is sometimes excessive or too silly see the ridiculous scene of 'jfk ' but good actors are fun to see besides kilmer and d'onofrio adam goldberg luis guzmn deborah kara unger wong peter sarsgaard doug hutchison and anthony lapaglia appear with bits of lee ermey danny trejo meat loaf the film is a noir and like any noir the story is complicated and often implausible but film is always slick and stylish and manages to engae the fans of the genre
we did n't know what to expect from this our only link to the title was val kilmer who 's a favourite actor of ours we were both pleasantly and disturbingly engaged during the movie the characters slowly grew on us especially vincent d'onofrio 's who we remember from full metal jacket and it 's one of the movies where we could n't get enough of the special features ! we only access special features when it 's a great movie !
richard donner 's maverick '' probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since mel brooks 's blazin ' saddles '' based on the atypical television western starring james garner mel gibson does a great job taking over from garner as the suave debonair gambler brett maverick en route to the world series of poker in saint louis missouri he joins forces with a younger ambitious gambler annabelle bransford jodie foster who is as sly as a fox older marshal zane cooper james garner and a sympathetic indian pal graham greene both mel gibson and jodie foster are hysterically funny giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler alfred molina and a whole colorful assortment of other wild west bad guys many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great hollywood westerns like james coburn and denver donner does a fine job directing his cast which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst gibson foster and garner is absolutely superb
from the director of lethal weapon '' and superman '' and it shows really enjoyed this film spectacular shots of the west shot in yosemite mel gibson is looking old like early but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something he 's too comic here as he has been of late i much preferred him in soffell '' and hamlet '' and james garner was perfect all cool to gibson 's manic energy and tons and tons of cameos from danny glover to doug mcclure to robert fuller but gibson was not as smooth as garner in the original maverick '' nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself the movie was entertaining but gimmicky from the borrowings from lethal weapon '' and raiders '' to graham greene 's wisecracking indian it was just a little too precious gibson should go back to serious stuff and look what he does now ! i must admit the ending caught me i had not a clue but as a fun movie it definitely works james coburn must be mentioned he looked great sounded great was great how old is he anyway mel gibson should age so well and a beautiful old steamboat plot was all about poker and money what else
this is an excellent movie i bought it for my husband but i have to admit i truly enjoy it too this is one of the best comedic westerns around ! it has a great plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end !
this is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about it is about laughs it is a comedy that takes place in the old west mel gibson plays a professional gambler brett maverick who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament the entry fee is and the prize is half a million dollars he has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him always with hilarious results as he makes his way towards to tournament he encounters another gambler played by jodie foster who also wants to enter the tournament she too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket the final main character is the us marshall played by james garner he does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well he has been hired to provide security as they make their way to the big event all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others the indians get involved and come across as the funniest most honest and most intelligent people around they finally get maverick his stake with lots of laughs and the stage is set for the big tournament the tournament itself is full of laughs surprises twists and turns it also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars all of this is fun but the interplay between gibson foster and garner is the real fun get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing
a 1990 's western comedy featuring mel gibson maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters the film does n't take itself so seriously as many films with a western setting tend to do based on the 1950 's television series by the same name in which james garner had a starring role maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy when bret maverick mel gibson needs to enter a poker tournament he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs but he quickly encounters angel alfred molina a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill maverick his attempt inevitably fails along the way maverick meets up with annabelle bransford jodie foster a slick conniving poker player who picks maverick 's pocket following a brief romantic encounter when maverick catches her he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment shrinking his designer shirt annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with maverick running after her after boarding the boat the two are joined by marshal zane cooper james garner a kind retired sheriff famous throughout the west cooper 's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with maverick 's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with bransford as the three travel cross country they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff a showdown with hundreds of indians and maverick 's financial dealings with an archduke from russia separated in the confusion the three eventually meet again on the riverboat lauren belle home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat 's owner commodore duvall making use of his quick wit maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game as well as a few thousand extra for annabelle bransford commodore duvall puts marshal zane cooper in charge of guarding the in entry fees for the tournament in which angel also happens to be a participant but in addition to beating angel maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge overall maverick is great entertainment the acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by mel gibson jodie foster and james garner each of the main characters creates a likeable persona and what makes this movie a because the plot leaves much to be desired is the ability of the characters to create a personal connection with the audience several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious such as the ones with joseph graham greene maverick is n't the type of movie that will win academy awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe but it is a whole lot of fun and if you want to do is laugh give this movie a try the dvd repor
with a renewed interest of the western '' genre in 80 's 90 's young guns tombstone unforgiven and classic tv series being made into films maverick was a natural to sum up the film it is just a plain fun richard donner and mel gibson take their collaboration from the lethal weapon films and even take danny glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying i 'm getting too old for this ! '' to make a very satisfying everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride james garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as marshall zane cooper mel gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into he 's going to get out of it the plot is mainly maverick trying to get to and raise funds for a poker tournament on a louisiana steamboat along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc jody foster on the heels of two major oscar wins plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card artist annabelle bransford alfred molina 2 shows his versatility once again as angel '' maverick 's arch enemy graham greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect native american joseph who is after the mighty dollar also a who 's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out lastly veteran james garner is good in everything he does the closing scenes with garner gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying overall fun light entertaining and perfect
a great movie ! what an all star cast ! this movie is worth watching over and over again
picture quality quality overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie improves as movie goes on this being a very senic movie i was not completly happy but still satisfied could 've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but sound quality in dolby was awesome not in dolby digital but on a system with pro logic ii it souded great if not better than most dolby surround all surround sounds are present and really stood out the soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room very happpy with this dvd sound movie spolier the movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a fun western movie comedy action stunts scenery and many great actors everything you would want in a fun '' western film in the old fashioned tradition light on violence and good enough for the whole family the best and my favorite thing about this movie is the fact that james garner still plays as maverick even though the audience does n't know it watching it over and knowing that mel gibson is playing his role as the son of maverick '' and james garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and overall review is that it is worth buying and i 'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better do n't be fooled though i have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component dvd player so i see almost any grain there is if any is present overall this dvd was satisfying enough to make me happy i bought it on any other tv it will display a perfect picture sound quality is great on a home theatre sound is a movie that should be made on a superbit dvd
i probably own four or five books on the 8 pieces of brocade a qigong exercise that at first does not appear to be complex or difficult to learn after reading the various books on this exercise i felt that i had a pretty good grasp of how to do the exercises and what to expect watching this dvd was very enlightening and corrected some misconceptions i had about the exercises the book by yang jwing ming is excellent but as suggested by the author using the dvd and the book together is a very effective technique for obtaining accurate and effective results while doing this form the dvd offers both the sitting and standing versions of the 8 pieces of brocade exercise yang starts off the dvd with a history of the 8 pieces of brocade which was created approximately one thousand years ago the 8 pieces of brocade is presented in two main sections the sitting version and the standing version first shown is an analysis of the steps in the sitting version throughout this analysis the dvd uses multiple angle shots to display the front sides and rear of yang as he demonstrates each of the movements additionally the added benefit of sound helps the student to realize for example how hard to tap the teeth or when to breath in and out even the tapping of the fingers on the back of the skull during one of the exercises helps the student to do the movement correctly by listening to the sound that is made when yang demonstrates the movement following a very detailed and clear presentation during the analysis of the 8 pieces of brocade the form is then shown in its entirety with the convenient chapter markers available on the dvd the student can easily follow along whatever section they choose the movement to dvd for the ymaa products has made learning much easier by allowing this convenient and instant access to any part of the material after the analysis of the sitting form of the 8 pieces of brocade the dvd then presents the analysis of the standing form of the 8 pieces of brocade followed by a continuous demonstration of the form the student is then treated to a lecture by yang on the 8 pieces of brocade this lecture is approximately 50 minutes and has a wealth of information about the form clever use of animation helps to illustrate the flow of chi that occurs while doing the form in my opinion the way to learn martial arts successfully is to employ the following tools instruction from a teacher studying printed material visualization in your mind self practice and study while doing the forms writing a journal to record what is learned or taught during each lesson watching videos of the teacher filming yourself and comparing it to the image you had in your mind of how you were doing the form socialize and share your knowledge with other students and work on the principles together try teaching one of the concepts moves techniques or applications to a person who has no knowledge of taijiquan in the process you will easily learn as much as the person you are trying to teach this dvd is one of the above mentioned tools and a wonderful addition for the serious student to learn and practice properly the 8 pieces of brocade
this dvd lives up to its promises it introduces you to the world of qigong i have personally practised some qigong exercises before from some books but after watching this dvd i realized that i was doing them somewhat wrong i did n't see any of what i had been practising in this video however doing qigong is like a poem actually it was a poem for ancient chinese like a moving meditation it 's soft and smooth whereas i had a rigid and strict execution this dvd presents two sets of exercises sitting on a bed let 's say for elderly and weak people and standing for everyone else there is a track presenting the history of qigong specifically this set and detailed explanations of each exercise including medical benefits what internal organ you would be massaging by doing them granted you need more information breathing it is only briefly touched but then again a beginner could only get so much or else s he becomes scared of so many new things still yang has a book with the same title i 've ordered and received mine but have n't started reading it yet that should explain more things the book and the video complement each other the former has more information but the latter shows you the execution get them both i 'm also a beginner and have no teacher but apparently looking at customer reviews for qigong beginners this is the course path that i recommend that is what i am going to order and study even if i get a teacher in the meantime stick to 8 pieces of brocade until you execute it well and by that i mean not only physical execution which you will probably get soon it 's very simple but also mental you master it when you are able to focus on it from beginning to end or sort of get chi kung the way of healing '' by master lam kam chuen those exercises should prepare you for the next stage get chi kung the way of energy '' by master lam kam chuen and opening the energy gates of your body '' by bruce frantzis kumar those books complement each other note that apparently all the exercise in way of healing '' are actually easier selections from way of energy '' so do n't be surprised i guess because of this you could skip the way of healing '' phase completely when all the above is done you should have greatly improved your energetics but it could take years or even a lifetime without a teacher you are then ready to study yang 's other books i wo n't write the relevant ones here although i had started too but removed the paragraph by then you should know which they are they do n't belong in this beginner 's review anyway at that stage you should probably get a teacher in short this is a nice beginner 's introduction short of having a teacher did i mention to get a teacher
i highly reccommend this dvd for interested beginners and experienced martial arts practitioners alike who wish to learn a set of qigong exercises designed to improve health the dvd is thoughtfully produced and has a lot of interesting background and historical information a novice will be able to learn a complete set of breathing and movement exercises in a very short time
i have had this a while but have n't used it since it 's so easy it 's boring therefore i only use it when i 'm not feeling well recently i had a severe allergic reaction used this i have been using herbs acupuncture but i really felt so much better faster using this to build up my energy even when i was very dizzy felt horrible i went very slowly on the standing exercises felt much better after more energy deep down was able to fall asleep faster then i had in days the sitting ones are even more easy for those who can not stand in the area there is an english or american narrator while they show a clip of yang doing the exercises a few times in another section the practice is yang shows you the complete exercises about each which only takes about min unfortunately on mine in this section the sound seems to be by full seconds like almost all qi gong videos they all say once you start you must complete it i always do a return to chi motion there are a lot of extras there is a nice amount of lecture about the basics of energy flow how qi gong works this dvd is almost two hours long so you are getting your money 's worth yang is one man any serious martial artist i have ever talked to knows has read about there are trailers on his site at ymaa
the dvd is a more expensive than it should be but it is very thorough i like doing the standing sequence with yang it is very relaxing and i feel loosened up
an excellent dvd for someone to begin practicing qigong easy to learn and beautiful to look at these exercises are the most effective and popular qigong movements for the last years this dvd also has a lot of information on it for someone interested in learning more and going deeper with a long instructional section with master yang where he explains exactly how and why these qigong exercises work he goes into great detail explaining the breathing and qi energy with specific instruction on many skills such as generating 'guardian qi ' to protect your health his teaching style is very clear and balanced with evidence from western medical society and a lot of historical knowledge this is the most complete qigong video out there he shows how to do each move in various ways depending if you are flexible already or not clearly he is experienced with teaching students of all ages and health levels the subtitles are great the glossary of chinese terms pertaining to chinese qigong is amazing and the half hour of trailers for other ymaa tai chi and kung fu videos is inspiring
i was introduced to the benefits of qigong by a good friend a few months ago i noticed that it had immediate physical benefits i had been searching for a practice that would help increase my physical energy this is a wonderful introduction to qigong for beginners i bought the video on the recommendations of the reviewers here and have not been disappointed plus it is a very reasonable cost compared to the other options yang gives very clear and concise explanations of the theory behind the poses the exercises are simple to do i have started with the sitting exercises and am doing them morning and night the past few days i suffer from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia and bought this to improve the energy flow in my body i have been feeling very weak lately due to lack of sleep and stress and found that the poses gave me immediate benefit by taking a layer of pain off my body i am sleeping better too i will check back in 3 months to update the benefits also it became clear to me from watching the dvd that the problems i am having are energy problems after doing the exercises i could feel the chi flowing in parts of my body that have been blocked namely my feet and arms i also noticed that my kidneys are extremely sore and probably depleted i was shocked these exercises made me more aware of what is really going on in my body the sitting exercises are great for those who need to take it slow to the senior gentleman who was upset that yang did n't go into modifications yes you are right but you need n't worry if you ca n't stretch all the way to your toes just stretch as far forward as you can comfortably do he also says in his analysis that the repetitions are guidelines and to do what you can a great dvd i ca n't wait to see how i 'm feeling in a few months the dvd made me realize that i need to renergize my kidney 's and i am buying herbal tea and herbs to assist in that process i for one am tired of exercise that pushes the body past it 's limits this set of poses works with the body that you have now
as a 15 year practicioner of tai chi chuan this system of qigong and this dvd in particular is one of the best i have ever seen it goes into just the right amount of detail and description is beautifully done and clearly yang is a gifted teacher i have seen many martial art training videos and the quality of this is way above par this is a beautiful qigong form that is sure to bring health to anyone who practices daily it 's the real deal !
i really enjoyed watching this dvd and was suprised at how easy it was to memorize the different positions i was able to learn so quickly because of the very informative and clear explanations this dvd is a very high quality production and incredibly informative after studying it for a week i feel that i know enough about the basics of chi kung to teach it to others it was great to learn more about the history of chi kung also i highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to quickly learn about the 8 pieces of brocade and how to perform the exercise sets
i must say that 'best laid plans ' is in a league of it 's own i have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate this film may not be perfect and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state nick is in but the overall plot of this film is one i 've never seen done before from the opening scene in the bar when reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells nick we 're screwed '' you start to realize that what you think you know you do n't and thats the case throughout this entire movie from the start to the finish you have no clue who 's involved in what when nick nivola makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun he has just a few days to get or he 's going to be worse than dead then his friend brice brolin moves back and nick and lissa witherspoon come up with a plan only it backfires and then they find a way out of it but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started litterally this movie for all it 's twists and turns and originality while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama 4 stars
see this it will shock you move you thrill you excite you chill you freak you out it 's one amazing strange movie it really takes a while to understand it at times but it has many valuable lessons one can learn witherspoons performance is shattering and remarkable among other things a great movie will be seen more times then i can count the next times i play it in my playe
at first glance this would appear to be a very serious movie the opening hour or so reminded me of the movie body shots which is a rather disturbing film what is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon what you end up with is something totally different than what you think you 're getting in the beginning reese witherspoon stars once again as a young girl lost type persona she seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in twilight and freeway while the present film is not quite as as freeway it is still pretty far out in if you 're a fan of reese witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of the twilight zone this one might be for you while there are many obvious clues during the film as to what 's going on i did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation can you
this film illistrates the human desire for freedom a man nivola has fallen in a hole and he needs cash fast his girfriend witherspoon goes to the extremes to dig him out this is witherspoons finest role yet she takes you deep inside her characters mind and shows how love and compassion direct the character through her toughest decisions lissa witherspoon and her boyfriend nivola need to get out of this find out what they will do to do so
great film ted griffin 's script is far more powerfull than say 'the usual suspects ' a fun film with a fun plot twist but that 's a box office handicap a powerfull story can be powerfully disturbing we can be frightened by the bigger than life bad guy 'keesyer sosa ' in suspects '' with complete detatchment after all what are the chances this crazed monster is going to blow up your house it 's like watching dracula it 's fun to be scared precisely because we do n't believe in vampires but in 'the best laid plans ' no boats explode no running gun battles ensue and we are firmly in america not transylvania where to permit myself an understatement sometimes there 's a problem with money so if you were truly desperate how far would you go to save your skin ask the woman you love to have sex with a patsy you can blackmail sell out a friend to the allmighty dollar wonderfully used by the writer in the metaphor of a rare bill worth a fortune i mean if your life was on the line with the mob at your heels and the clock was running out the honorable thing for you to do would be the hero falls short of heroics here wonder they could n't get a name star to play the male lead what would his fans think it 's odd how citics are fond of cliche statements about film noir being a genre that 'exposes the dark underside of our culture ' but when a film truly does so with uncompromising brilliance it 's apparently time to back down and go on the scary ride at the amusement park instead or make yet another remake of dracula pity a stylish and suspenseful film film noir
i have watched sesame street all my life i enjoyed it immensly when i was a wee lad in the early eighties and throughout my life watching it with little cousins and whatnot since my baby son has become able to watch the show i started a few months back collecting various dvd 's lets face it sesame street is the only show for kids that i can enjoy as much as the kids its even the new ones are pretty good but this dvd is gold stuffed with the bits and sketches that are harder to find although the show does still make an effort to work in some of these oldies on the regular which i must applaud these are the ones that i was looking for in the first place the ones that i watched when i was a kid however some of the stuff in this disc are even a little strange to me since they were retired before i was born most noticeable is the early big bird who seems to be a little autistic i 'm not sure also the first three seasons had a different guy playing the role of gordon other than that pretty much all the adult characters are the same hooper was before my time but i had heard of him plenty of and maria ! wow she was like seventeen when this show started she was a fox ! hola means hello maria anyway i cant wait to get down with my two year old and watch the entire seven hours of this thing old school sesame street rules ! ! ! its funny its got a real laid back chill groove that is great for calming down the kids a and yes still way more educational than about 90 percent of what i see on pbs these days
there is a disclaimer on this set that warns that the material presented in this dvd may not meet the educational needs of today 's children my advice is to ignore this ridiculous warning the material presented on this dvd is some of the best work sesame street ever produced sure some of its dated but what a perfect opportunity to talk to your kids about history culture and all sorts of things i really loved this dvd it brought back many happy memories of watching the show and i was surprised as to how many skits i remembered this is a definate muppet must along with the muppet show christmas eve on sesame street muppet family christmas and the first three muppet movies
in the evenings my young son and i sit down to eat dinner in front of the tv set yes i know it 's bad parenting to plop a kid in front of a tv at mealtime and usually sesame street '' is what we are watching like most he enjoys the muppet characters the humorous plotlines and hopefully he 's getting something educational out of it but as 42 year old dad who was a child of the and has sweet rose colored nostalgic memories of growing up in the it just seems like something is missing from what i remember now i do n't want to bash the current show for my money it 's still the best educational programming for on the tube today but had i outgrown it or is the noodle version of the show somehow different well recently i got my answer when i gave my son the newly released dvd boxset sesame street old school '' for his fifth birthday who am kidding i was actually buying it for myself once i put these discs on and the opening credits started it was like a powerful wave of nostalgia ran over instantly started singing the bouncey unforgettable theme song and as the show 's opening rolled by i started recognizing the mostly urban kids and the seal that had been indelibly etched in my mind my favorite is the pensive little girl on the tricycle watching these early episodes on disc makes me realize just how how revolutionary energetic imaginative and well written this show really was in it 's early years i love the amazing animation segments that taught numbers and the alphabet with humor and just a touch of pychedelia early versions of the muppet characters are there including big bird with a smaller head bert ernie oscar the grouch he 's orange ! and of course kermit the frog this amazed my son who only knew the green one through movies and the muppet show '' dvds the original friendly cast of humans are also all there which included gordon susan bob hooper luis and more i love the ideal of hanging out with these folks ! the shows are a treasure trove of nostalgia i love looking at the clothes including bell bottoms flower shirts with huge collars and mini skirts the actors including the kids all have either long hair or those afros i also love the show 's soundtrack which makes ample use of both jazz and style funk also throughout the episodes are cameos from younger versions of carol burnett bill cosby jackie robinson lena horne james earl jones and the late johnny cash the dvd boxset is made up of three discs which contain the season premieres of the first 5 seasons it interesting to see the show evolving and becoming more polished as time goes by also included are 45 bonus segments including my favorite tunes rubber duckie '' and being green '' the extras also include the original pitch reel '' use to sell the show to broadcasters the dvd picture sound mastering is well done i 've seen a number of videotaped shows from that era now appearing on dvd that do n't look half as good if i had but one complaint it 's about a warning thats put on the first disc which says these early sesame street episodes are intended for grownups and may not suit the needs of today 's preschool children '' where did they get that from my preschooler was absolutely engrossed in these episodes he smiled and laughed as he counted and read along with the segments one farm episode in particular got the two of us into a long conversation about milking cows hey its important to a 5 year old ! this really is wonderful dvd boxset which chronicles the early years of a show that revolutionized children 's television it is both fun and entertaining hopefully the fact that there is a volume 1 on the box means there is more to come ! i highly recomend it for both nostalgic adults and their young children do n't wait just buy it
rather than go with the traditional box '' release schedule the producers have taken the far more digestible and appealing approach of selecting highlight episodes from the show 's first five seasons this makes for a wonderful viewing experience for feeling nostalgic for their childhoods to be honest most people would n't want to sit through an entire season 's worth anyway the greatest hits '' '' classic clips '' approach is far more palatable while the muppets are undeniably cute this is a package that is squarely aimed at adults there is an interesting disclaimer in the booklet as well as an animated introduction on disc 1 that explains how teaching methods have changed dramatically in the last 30 years and that some components and ideas are no longer necessarily suitable for today 's young audiences to watch on their own for example in the first episode gordon is walking alone with one of his young students after school and giving her a tour of sesame street his wife invites the little girl to come over later for milk and cookies and she accepts immediately her parents are nowhere to be seen and are never consulted in another episode a little lost girl uses a dime to call home for help but a supergrover forcibly carries her away ostensibly to save her mom the trip and of course there 's the issue of the grownups not believing big bird even though he 's telling the truth about the snuffleupagus disc 1 also contains the original 30 minute pitch reel that the children 's television workshop designed for public broadcasting stations to consider the show introduced by ctw founding member joyce ganz cooney the reel features rowlf the dog explaining the show concept creating commercials '' for letters and numbers to kermit by showing test clips and footage of development meetings it 's absolutely fascinating and genuinely to see the people involved in pioneering what was an exciting and new learning medium you see footage of a cartoon the letter j '' being pitched developed animated recorded and tested on kids it 's a remarkable process that makes you appreciate the hard work and true heart that goes into creating something positive for children the footage interspersed with muppet producers '' trying to come up with a name for this wonderful new show there are five episodes spread across three discs one from each year between including the pilot each episode can be viewed as originally broadcast or you can jump directly to a certain skit the discs also contain separate sections that contain highlights from each season as a whole so you can revisit hilarious classics like ernie counts sheep '' grover 's restaurant '' sesame street news rapunzel '' trippy cartoons like loaf of bread container of milk and stick of butter '' alligator king '' the pinball song '' and great songs like bein ' green '' rubber duckie '' c is for cookie '' and i love trash '' there are also remarkable celebrity appearances with bill cosby jackie robinson james earl jones lou rawls and carol burnett counting or reciting the alphabet it 's also interesting to see our favorite characters before they were fully developed big bird is initially presented as an extraordinarily goofy character and oscar is a strange nuclear orange the booklet is packed full of information on the process and includes a to help put things in perspective when sesame street debuted the average median income was less than 9000 ! there 's a puzzle section aimed at children but i ca n't see too many kids actually bothering with it plus the grownups wo n't want to tear up their booklet ! if you 're feeling reflective and want to revisit sesame street this is an essential purchase that gives you the nostalgia fix you need without wearing out its welcome
i was born in 1961. i was born before sesame in 1969. that 's when the first time pbs had sesame this before embo or baby bear i have watch it when my little sister gail was born i had the cookie moster pupput i do n't have any more we also had lp record of sesame this before the cd 's came out
it 's about time these things went on dvd the classic episodes are great i do n't have noggin so up until now i had to resort to youtube to see them i bought the dvds to watch with my old daughter even though they do n't have elmo in them she likes the other characters too i might not show her the first episode it 's pretty trippy but it was great watching how it all got started the pitch film was very funny it 's a lot more like the muppet show rather than sesame street i hope they release a vol 2 soon
i 've been waiting for this for years ! i 'm so excited that i will finally be able to show my son all of the wonderful characters i remember from my childhood now if only they would come out with rogers on
i was so excited for this release when i heard about it i ran right over and it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive when i put it in to watch it well i was a little sad i had somehow convinced myself that i was getting all the episodes for the seasons which is silly given that it was a week but still you ca n't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head so color me disappointed tbs what is included is great i 'm sad to say dd is unimpressed but that 's because she 's jaded i 'll work on her they note at the start that it 's for adults and not today 's preschoolers '' which is odd to me it 's sesame street ! it 's always been for preschoolers are ours somehow more advanced than we were

i found this movie to be amazing you really connected with the characters this is the type of movie that you either hate it or you love it i for one loved it the scene with lee grant screaming at the end is a tear jerker i 've seen this movie numberous times and still cry during that scene i love the closeness he had with his friends and the distance he had with his father it was very similar to my family and friends if you like emotional movies buy it if your not into the sappy movies do n't buy it
i saw this one in the movie theatre since then it really made an impression on me some think it is depressing my family specifically i enjoyed the acting and the premise behind the plot
a brilliant but sad movie about the effects of aids both to the patient and to the family and friends eric roberts gregory harrison and the rest of the cast were phenomenal for those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease you will definitely be moved to the point of tears then laughter then tears again i thought this was definitely oscar material it is right up there with philadelphia '' in my book
a wonderful movie have a box a tissue ready ! ! eric roberts is incredibl
this movie is my all time favorite movie the cast is awesome you really feel the pain and anguish in amalia played by lee grant as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son 's life this movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved i love the way that randal kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless the movie at times feels a little forced but i ca n't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours
this has to be one of the most moving films i have seen ! the story involves a man infected with hiv back in the early days who decides to end his life when he is diagnosed with aids the character decides to say goodbye to all the special people in his life by throwing a party this movie will make you laugh and cry at several points throught as everyone has said watch it with someone and have lots of kleenex handy
this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect
the outstanding graphics and animation are typical of any movie from hayao miyazaki the story is entertaining amusing and touching i highly recommend this movie which i feel is in the same class as spirited away and totoro
it is wonderously perfect in every way the artwork is top notch the story is vivid and alluring the characters are interersting and develope well not as indepth as i would like but it is still well done this is my favorite movie
a must see for not only anime lovers but anyone who enjoys beautiful scenic frames and the classic theme of good versus evil personally i liked it better than spirited away ''
i 'm not sure what it is about miyazaki films but for some reason a 21 year old here feels like an 8 year old again i 'm not saying this movie is just for kids or anything but i would highly recommend the movie for any parents out there now i went and watched the movie without knowing anything about it and sure i was a bit unsure of the movie at first but miyazaki won out in the end technically the movie is pretty good the voice overs are pretty decent if you are one of those people that could n't stand say dakota fanning and her sister in my neighbor totorro '' you have nothing to worry about i got to give props to billy crystal he does a great job i really do n't know what else to tell you by now you should just buy it already especially if you are already a miyazaki fan if not this one would be a great one to see first i 'd also recommend princess mononoke and kiki 's delivery service
it is an excellant animation and my kids loved it we all di
let me say right away that i enjoyed and appreciated the elements of steam punk '' in this film people who enjoyed steam boy '' neal stephenson 's the diamond age '' the difference engine '' by william gibson and bruce sterling the vision of escaflowne '' series some of the aspects of the warcraft '' universe and the australian award winning animated film the mysterious geographical adventures of jasper morello '' will enjoy the general steam punk '' feel of howl 's moving castle the story of sophie is very engaging and beguiling howl to some extent is a side interest in this film but then the men always are in miyazaki films it is the power and minds of the women which fascinate miyazaki not the men miyazaki is the ultimate feminist film maker who else would make a film where the central character is a little old lady i ca n't wait for tales from earthsea '' and the new miyazaki film !
for the most part you already know the story from reading the rest of the reviews and summaries someone referred to this as commercial animation and not your traditional animation you would get from miyazaki and i disagree since when has life been simple to just show us or lead us to believe that if you are in love nothing else goes on in the world to those that are in love i 'm sure nothing else would matter the war itself in this film is almost synonymous with howl 's irresponsibility the fact that they have chosen to fight without chance of talks and without regard of life from either side is highly irresponsible in the end howl learns to not run away and to stand forth such is when he is vulnerable but willing to take a chance at giving his heart to someone else to sophie and in the end give chance to make the rest of the world right i ca n't think of any other films that really make me feel as much as i do when i watch miyazaki 's films howl is no exception the amazing visuals the colours the vibrance the characters are always memorable and you fall in love with them always even the bad ones and the music ! you feel as though you are indeed a part of this world and trying hard not to fall out of your seat though the english cast is all star i myself prefer the japanese voice actors as they 're voices sound great regardless if you ca n't understand them i do believe billy crystal was miscast as calcifer watch it with subs first then turn on the dubs you 'll know what i mean but for the rest sophie has a soft sweet and beautiful voice lauren bacall plays a wonderfully malicious witch of the waste and christian bale plays a decent howl though for the mannerisms and dialogue i would expect someone younger to voice him all in all it 's definitely one of his top films and possibly my favourite i still love chihiro just as much same with mononoke but this will always be sitting right next them in terms of beauty artistry and story howl 's moving castle is indeed quite moving
loved it ! loved it ! loved it ! if you like miyazaki 's work you will not be disappointed
as a hitman fan growing up i was very excited for this release it did not disappoint at all ! its a disc that you can watch over and over since there is just so much that he accomplished in his career bret was more or less bitter about a lot of things and people in the last few years but he had the class to focus on his career and not on petty grudges he even goes on to praise flair for being a great worker even though he had no love for the nature boy he did not speak ill of shawn or vince and did not want to make montreal the focus which i think to many hitman fans we are very glad ! he wanted to show us his career rather than his opinions and that alone deserved a 5 star in my book i would like to say a few things regarding other reviews here did not want shawn on his dvd this is simply not true i read a bret interview where he said he wanted the iron match but that would mean he had to take off other matches and since it was on wm set he decided not to so please stop with the he cant accept shawn '' theory thing is how others did not comment on this disc wwe already made screwed the bret hart story and bret watched it i would assume he was hurt by a few people 's comments on it hogan flair lawler among others also i would assume none of the parties involved wanted to switch face and praise him plus he did about 7 hours of footage and edited down to 2 hours i am disappointed not to hear more from his peers but most of that generation does not work for wwe had fallouts with vince for those who want to include the screwjob '' honestly there is no reason to consider it it wasnt the best match between the two and the wwe ending '' was the ringing of the bell and shawn running out of the ring i dont know what you people hope to see but that 30 second ending isnt really worth it they do not show him breaking monitors or punching vince i felt his match collection was but it did not including anything from his lawler backlund yoko feuds and the whole series of events with austin couldve been included in more detail as it was so much fun to watch ! the matches selected showed how good of a wrestler he is and no he does not finish them all off with his finishing move unlike a lot of others who have dvds out ! i surely hope wwe can someday release a second set of bret hart matches similiar to what they did for the undertaker he def have 3 more dvd full of great matches ! in the meantime i will be enjoying the collection and relive the memories of bret the hitman hart
the absolute best is hitman hart wrestling with shadows however if you want the newest interviews with bret along with some of the best footage you can see of him from his early stampede days to wcw this is the dvd to get ! i 'm so glad to finally have some excellent matches of his on dvd my only complaint was the audio on the hart austin match for wrestlemania 13 is off by about 2 seconds which does n't sound like much but is very noticeable when someone hits the mat and there 's no sound until a few seconds later but it 's not enough to drop it down to 4 stars the tributes to his brothers owen and dean as well as other fallen commrades including brother in law davey boy smith curt hennig big boss man rick rude miss elizabeth and others were touching they did an excellent job with this dvd despite the fact mcmahon had to give a bs statement at the beginning about bret '' putting their differences aside '' for the sake of the dvd it was very obviously another dig by an unscrupulous shyster if you 're looking for the montreal screwjob '' match in its entirety on this dvd you wo n't find it it was cut for time and bret said he wanted to '' it on this project but is featured in bits and pieces in the documentary itself thankfully bret hocking on mcmahon was shown several times which made me smile after the opening statement by mcmahon highly recommended
this is a great set if you are interested in knowing bret hitman '' hart the man however the matches leave much to be desired it seems that bret focused more on choosing matches that were sentimental to him as opposed to what would be most memorable to fans overall i would still recommend this set because it is a first rate documentary however if you want more wrestling and less documentary you might want to spring for the undertaker dvd
this dvd set is truly wonderful and is a must have for every bret hart fan it was long overdue and the dvd set does focus on the postive points of bret 's career
this three disc set is a for any wrestling fan the first disc does a great job of telling the story of how he became the hitman and covers the controversy in montreal which forced him to leave wwe as well as his look back on the tragic passing of his brother owen the other two discs include most of the hitman 's best matches his match with hbk from wrestlemania 12 was left out probably because bret wanted it left out and maybe since it was a very long match some of the matches included are wm 13 submission match austin wm 10 owen and his summerslam match against the british bulldog this is a great dvd set that does well with capturing the true essence of why bret hart was the excellence of execution i believe this set includes a total of 18 hitman matches which were not only singles matches but also his matches from earlier in his career in tag team action along with jim the anvil niedhart in the hart foundation so this set is just great simply because it is comprehensive in its coverage of bret 's career from early wwe to his days in wcw buy this dvd set you will not be disappointed
the greatest wrestler to have ever graced a squared circle finally gets to shed light on his legacy ever since survivor series bret hart 's career has n't been labeled with the words excellence of execution '' but with the word screwed '' and it 's stayed that way for over close to 10 years and would have been kept that way for the rest of his life after the original annoucement that this dvd would be labeled screwed the bret hart story '' however bret stepped up was able to erase that word from his legacy is replace it with best there is best there was best there ever will be '' and also made this one of the most unique '' dvd sets in wwe history the early years of bret growing up in the hart household and breaking into his dad 's stampeed wrestling kick the documentry off his entrance in to wwe and not really getting off to a good start cowboy bret hart until he finally teamed with jim neidhart jimmy hart to form the hart foundation the hart foundation 's dominance over the tag team division as well as bret 's ability to be a heel are glossed over before his road to the intercontinental championship and how important that championship was to his career which is amazing compared to how it 's being used in wwe today his classic matches featuring roddy piper wrestlemania viii my favorite hitman '' match perfect british bulldog summerslam are also looked upon leading up to his first wwe title reign including highlights from the match with flair that is rare to find the impact is had on making him an international superstar and how he was able to make to have people apprechate wrestling more over than hulk hogan 's sports entertainment his fued with his brother owen is discussed after bret discusses his disappointment in how his first title reign ended remember hulk hogan at wrestlemania ix and how he worked his way back to the title including the king of the ring tournament his disapointment in his third title reign being completely overlooked infavor of shawn michaels leading up to his wrestlemania xii ironman match the ironman match is heavily discussed as bret talks about how he thought everything promos commentary during the match were in favor of hbk his return to wwe after his vacation and the heated fued between himself stone cold steve austin is heavily discussed as well as the respect for one another bret 's last run which provoked a canada fued along with the new hart foundation is discussed leading up to the survivor series survivor series is n't heavily talked about but you get everyone 's feelings now after they 've had plently of times to reflect on their actions bret 's disappointing run in wcw is discussed along with bret 's favorite moments including the owen hart tribute match the profile on bret rounds out with him talking about his stroke and how his life has been for the past few years dvd extras include interview outtakes where bret discusses certain issues like the name the dungeon '' how konnan taught bret the sharpshooter a funny owen story where he crankcalled stu hart the story behind his sunglasses and the whole hart family tree also bret pays tribute to his friends in the wrestling business who passed away along with his late brother dean hart hidden extras were his you start the fire '' music video an old stampeed wrestling interview featuring the bushwackers then known as the sheepherders and interview outtakes feauturing bret discussing never injuring another wrestler and where he got the name hitman '' earlier i said this was the most unique dvd set in wwe history and that 's because instead of following the usual pattern of putting high profile matches title wins most memorable matches bret picked out his personal favorite matches and most of which are rare and most people did n't know happened or were so low profile that people forget they happened these type of matches feature ricky steamboat bam bam bigelow ted dibiase hakushi owen hart undertaker and matches as the hart foundation against british bulldogs killer beez and the rockers alot of bret 's ppv high profile matches are included featuring himself as the tag team champions the hart foundation against nasty boys wrestlemania vii two matches against perfect king of the ring including his first intercontinental title win summerslam his wrestlemania x match against owen hart his no holds barred match against wwe champion diesel survivor series the only world title win on his dvd british bulldog in your house the submission match from wrestlemania 13 against steve austin the audio is off by at least a second and the owen hart tribute match from wcw nitro against chris benoit overall this is probably one of the best dvd sets that wwe has put out is a fitting tribute to bret the hitman '' hart
this dvd in my opinion is by far the best bio dvd done so far the program part which runs around for a little more than 2 hrs is excellent the eighteen matches that are on here are excellent its just a very well done and well deserved dvd to one of the greatest wrestlers of all time i think they should have one more dvd cause there is more than enough great matches that didnt make this dvd here 's what it should look like also according to articles ive read bret recorded more than 7 hrs in interviews and only about 2 and half made the dvd im not saying they have another documentary just some extra interview on the extras part of the dvd title excellence of execution this should be like the undertaker dvd where a narrator setups each match would be prolly 10 hrs disc 1 match 1 wrestlemania

the thing that gets me about bret everytime is his sincerity he always has and always will be a lover of the sport more than anything else this set delivers and it delivers all you could want except maybe bret beating down on vince just a personal fantasy and you almost get that too ! but more than anything you get tons of good solid straight up talk from a man who dedicated himself to entertaining a public with something he loved and was born and raised to do he 's had to endure some awful misfortune but this guy shows us all how to stand up and fight and not just for cash
i 'm not keen on workout tapes or dvds but i bought this because i got a deal when i bought the book too but this is a great workout dvd with 3 levels one right for everyone it does n't take long to work out with it and the music that accompanies the action really gets you going i 've lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks by using the abs diet book it should n't be called a diet more of a lifestyle change in a positive way that anyone can stick with and the dvd
i have dozens of workout videos and i have been religious about this one ! i usually just do beginning intermediate and advanced for one long workout i disagree that it is only for women i think it is for men most men i know do n't like working out to videos it is a great video and i have already recommended it to my friends
this is the perfect dvd companion for the the abs diet book you eat more frequently you eat consciously and you exercise it works ! ! ! this plan keeps your metabolism at maximum speed all day long i eat more than i ever ate before and i have been able to keep in good shape i was able to lost more than 200 lbs i have been able to keep in shape for more than two years i am in the best shape of my life thanks to the abs diet the really important thing for me is not just that i look great but that i feel great and that i am healthier than ever do n't take my word try the abs diet and i am sure that you will get the results that you expect just stay in the plant until it becomes habit ! ! ! another tools you may want to consider to complement the abs diet dvd and book with your strategies for boosting your metabolism loosing weight and even more important keeping that weight off are a body fat monitor or scale this will help you monitor your progress to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat fat lost increased metabolism and not muscle water or bone mass decreased metabolism a heart rate monitor wrist watch this is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your heart rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state increased metabolism ultrametabolism the simple plan for automatic weight loss '' which is another very practical readable and insightful book focused on how to boost your metabolism the hard body guide '' excellent strategies programs and workouts aimed to increase your muscle mass
i was wondering if this really works because there 's dvd 's and books that just lie to get millions ! and that bugs me a lot i was wondering if it actually worked because it 's sounds just too '' good but i have read some positive things from this dvd i was wondering if anyone out there that owns this could tell me and i would appreciate it thanks for the 5 stars i have no idea so do n't listen to please tell me if it really works okay thanks
just got the new dvd in and i love it i got into a workout rut got bored and have n't done anything for the past 2 weeks so when i got this in i was anxious for something new it 's like any typical video but this one actually works you out instead of killing you or being so slow you 're finished before they are yes the jokes are kinda cheesy the ladies in the back are n't using much weight blah blah i had such a good work out yesterday i can feel it all over esp my legs i love how he demonstrates every exercise and as for some of the reviews saying it was n't all that it 's like any routine you have to tweak any fitness plan to your level if you 're expecting a made just for you '' workout hire a personal trainer the modifications you 'd make would be simple someone mentioned it was a women 's workout '' it has women in it and of the umm get off your knees on your toes and place your hands a little closer together see a simple modification the girls in the video not lifting enough for you umm increase your weight it 's an awesome addition to any workout routine or a great start for those just beginning i myself will still make my bowflex the foundation of my workouts but i like knowing i have something else i can do when i 'm just not feeling the treadmill or weights
as a professional trainer my biggest concern is for begginers or sedentary people in search of a safe appropriate way to get started with an effective program for these people there are alot of bad choices out there but this dvd is perfect for beginners safe efficient and not overwhelming a great way to build a fitness foundation joey atlas the wizard of fitness
i love the abs diet itself so i was expecting great things from the workout it was pretty good but the moves are nothing new i was disappointed that the advanced total body circuit training '' was actually just 12 squats 12 lunges and some and that was it do n't get me wrong i felt it the next day but only after i did the routine twice the exercises are definitely effective but they 're nothing spectacular or new overall it 's a great workout but as you get a little stronger you can expect to have to do the routine more than once or add weight in order for it to be effective
i have two of the prevention fitness systems dance videos and they are two of my three favorites i am familiar with the teachers from earlier crunch dance videos i have to work at it a bit to get my heart rate up to where i want it by putting in some extra oomph but it is and i very much enjoy the routines they are the right length of time for me too i have a small amount of workout space and am able to do these in that space i look forward to my workout with this dvd
this is one of my best buys of the year by far marie forleo who led crunch cardio dance blast leads you through this dance workout she is joined by 4 other ladies a couple of them i have also seen in crunch workouts the are minute dance routines and reggae funk a warm up and isolations segment precedes the dance workouts and the cool down follows the warmup is short and sweet then you move into the isolations or dance basics segment these moves are designed to increase range of motion coordination and muscle definition some of the moves included her are shoulder rolls hip circles the box and more hip shakes this section is probably not necessary once you master the dance routines but i find myself doing it anyway because i enjoy it plus i like the music too afro latin is the first dance routine consisting of african tribal and latin moves steps seen here are the triple step strong arm movements salsa shoulder shimmeys african movements mambos play the double lunges and hip shakes shimmeys marie will show the move first slowly then will add arm movements then will do the move at tempo repeating a few times she does this for all the steps once each move is added and practiced a few times she will take the routine from the top once all the steps are learned you will run through the entire routine twice at the end reggae funk is the second dance routine steps in this segment include reggae groove single single double steps twist shrugs drop roll butterly dig freeze and willy bounce and mambo sunshine marie teaches this one in the same manner the routine starts out a little slow matching the music but picks up at the end and is a lot of fun after this segment marie leads you through a brief cooldown and stretch i really like this video marie is a great instructor i liked her quite well in crunch cardio dance blast and was hoping i would find another video with her in it this video is good for clutzy types like myself the steps are pretty easy to pick up though i ca n't seem to get the single single double step down for some reason ths music is good the set is clean and bright and marie and her participants seem to be enjoying themselves is this workout a sweatfest no but it 's a nice way to get some light cardio and is great for days you are not up to a strenuous workout but want to get some movement i find that i can be really lazy in the cardio department at times but usually can muster up the energy to do this video there are a few additional features on this dvd a fitness do 's and don'ts segment led by chris freytag who leads many of the prevention fitness dvds there is also a spanish instructions option which i have n't seen in another workout overall i highly recommend this one it has taken me a while to find a dance workout that i really like i finally did
i liked this work out it is very easy to follow the instructor who is very likable gives good instructions she gives each dance move a fun '' name so it is easy to remember i do this when i want to but do not have as much energy as usual or i will do it as a to another it always puts me in a good mood i liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section if you are looking for a dance fitness that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat this is not for you if you are looking for a fun easy then this is for you
this was a fun workout it really gets the heart rate up and it is easy to follow
if you have reasonable expectations of exercise dvds then you will ignore the review written by amazon fan '' and take heed of all of the other reviews because this dvd is classified as a 'fitness yoga ' dvd you do have to assume that it is a dvd for exactly that 'fitness ' it is not nor is it ever intended to be an instructional for dance you 're browsing in the wrong category if thats what you 're after in fact if you want to learn how to dance and will find yourself disappointed with any moves then shut down the computer now and go and sign up at your local dance studio i own several dance aerobics dvds and this is one of the best that i 've tried so far only topped by madonna grime 's african heat dvd few dance dvds strike that balance between being dancy enough to be original fun and being easy to follow this is as close as it gets to a perfect balance marie forleo is a fantastic instructor and goes through fast moves at half tempo a few times before letting it fly at full speed that being said full speed is n't breakneck speed you are still able to actually do the moves without compromising form here 's what you get warmup marie takes you through about a warmup that incorporates toe taps and your basic aerobics stuff to get you started and then with a few stretches to follow its not incredibly innovative stuff but hey its the warmup it does its job and thats all you can ask isolations now this is a good idea for those who are inexperienced with dance aerobics this short segment guides you on correct form when performing the moves and is a for those who are new to this sort of thing and in particular those who are inflexible in the hips dance segment this is my favourite segment on the dvd marie goes through the majority of the moves at half tempo first some of them are basic enough to learn at full tempo there is some pretty quick footwork in a salsa move that she teaches at the beginning of the combination though with a few times practice you should have it down what struck me the most about this segment was that halfway through it the music suddenly picked up and was cleverly synched with the combination the first half is very much a moves ' segment and the music at this point is fairly stuff at the halfway point the music suddenly resembles that of a brazilan carnival and it is at this point where you really start to get into the groove of the workout and find yourself having a blast dance segment i was n't too sure what to expect with this segment since for me reggae music has always made me want to go and lie down on a beach somewhere rather than get on up and boogie the choreography in this segment is innovative and funky but the music is exactly as reggae music is laid back the choreography does get your heart rate up and the moves are fun but it does n't draw you in like the segment does cooldown just like the warmup this bit does its job marie goes through a few simple inspired low impact moves to lower your heart rate her stretches are not comprehensive but they 're not bad there are a few extras on the disc particularly a segment presented by chris freytag on 'the do 's and don'ts of exercise ' rather than the do 's and don'ts of 'exercise ' this is specifically of 'toning ' and she demonstrates what poor technique looks like and what you should be doing instead for those of you who have attempted the other prevention dance dvd with jennifer galardi you can relax this dvd is nowhere near as fast paced as that one is that dvd is a prevention express dvd where the segments are only 10 minutes long designed for a ' lifestyle this dvd lengthens the segments a bit so that there is proper guidance on what to do so you wo n't be left feeling as disheartened from trying to follow marie 's moves marie has one other dvd out the 'cardio dance blast ' dvd from crunch which i found to be a bit slow and not as aerobic as this one is though i have no gripes about her personality at all she focuses more on technique and cueing rather than trying to motivate you if you 're looking for someone who will take your hand and walk you through a workout congratulating you on every single step you take and telling you that you 're beautiful and that they 're proud of you you need a denise austin workout marie is not denise austin for some of you knowing that will be enough to buy this dvd ! ha ! and cues and teaches very well you need to do the motivating yourself in summary 2 x dance segments isolations segment for newbies segment is most fun choreography is innovative and funky complicated fast moves are taught at half tempo first marie is a good instructor but does not try to motivate highly recommended
i wanted a workout that would be fun and that would also make me sweat i love this dvd i have two left feet and it was so easy for me to pick up the moves maria is a great instructor and she makes it so easy to follow the workout
i started with cardio dance blast by marie forleo also and i like it so much that i was looking for more work out done by this girl i found this dvd and i absolutely love it just as the other one she is a great instructor the way she breaks out the steps and put them together makes it so easy to follow i am having fun and working out at the same time it is the perfect combination i started dancing with her like a month ago and i already have very good results finally my waist is shrinking ! i highly recommend this dvd along with her previous one
prevention bring out some good workouts and this is another of them it 's a fun dance workout that is easy to do because you sometimes do n't realise that you are working out the instructor marie has been in a crunch dvd i have and she 's good in that and good in this she 's a good cuer and she 's motivating too she begins to teach a base move and then shows it at a faster tempo and then adds on to that initial move the section is the best because that 's the funkiest and there are some cool moves there is also the entire workout is about 50 or so minutes but as i said you do n't realise you 're working out but in fact you are and you 're also burning a lot of calories and fat this is good i enjoy it
a fun film well loved in the former soviet union a great cast and enjoyable story add up to 5 stars
my wife a russian turned me on to this movie a few years ago since then it 's been one of our favorites it is definitely worth buying if you have any interest in russia so many everyday sayings came out of these old soviet comedies it 's also a more honest portrayal of russia than we americans have been fed since way back into cold war times it 's important to note all the work that image entertainment has put into this edition the quality is excellent as always the menu page can be in english or russian the subtitles are in many languages including english and russian the russian subtitles are very useful for people like me that have studied the language but are not completely fluent and also for the children of russian immigrants
first time i saw this movie when it came out in 1971 i was 7 years old then i remember i laughed so hard i fell of the chair in movie theater now i do n't fall of the chair just because i installed seatbelts on my couch what makes a soviet era movie so good is that they all have clean humor pretty much rated ' without need for profanity and cheap jokes of today 's russian flicks trying to imitate worst of american movie culture this movie is still one of my favorites along with diamond arm and few others
this is one of the best comedies that were produced during the soviet time it 's funny pointed and represents the best of russian humor all actors who play in this movie are the elite of russian cinematography and hold a very special place in every russian heart those who think of russia as a gloomy grey place will be pleasantly surprised by this clean comedy with its quotes being a staple of russian language what wayne 's world is for americans so gentelmen of fortune is for russians strongly recommend it ! !
no commercials and i can watch it over and over again ! what is better than that for those who love early er this is a must ! i am trying to collect all the seasons and the prices have been the lowest that i can find not to mention the free shipping a must see
i have been watching er since it started and this second season was just fantastic to watch the extra features gives you your er fix over the summer i recommend to anyone
as i said in my season one review er '' started off better than pretty much any show i can think of it had an amazing pilot and then 24 incredible episodes which combined drama comedy and emotion perfectly the good news is that season two is ever better season two gets off to a great start as carter returns to the er to the scoldings and snide criticisms of benton this is a great season because it keeps the original cast together it is not until the next season that sherry stringfield tragically leaves the show this season has the whole original cast and the addition of boulet a wonderful new character who stuck around for several years the adventures the er staff undergo in this season include mark greene anthony edwards greene 's obviously strained marriage from season one finally completely crumbles in this season when his terrible wife cheats on him and then leaves him for the other man greene takes the divorce hard struggling with living as a bachelor until he finally gets back into the dating game near the end of the season doug ross george clooney this is perhaps ross 's greatest season and the season defines everything that makes george clooney a great actor and doug ross a great character a major continuing storyline this season involves ross attempting to help a little boy dying of aids and how his decisions interfere with greene 's beliefs also ross stars in perhaps the greatest episode of the season hell and high water '' where he saves a young boy from drowning in a drain this episode won multiple emmys and is a tense and exciting piece of television and one of the most memorable er '' episodes ever made susan lewis sherry stringfield without a doubt sherry stringfield 's greatest hour this season would n't be nearly as memorable without her and her storyline is by far the best thing about the entire year it 's a major year of growth for lewis as her sister chloe abandons her and leaves her with baby susie lewis spends the year raising and loving the child but trouble happens when chloe returns and demands to have the baby back not to spoil anything but one of the most heartbreaking er '' scenes involves susan and baby susie it brought me to tears john carter noah wyle carter has a very memorable romantic fling in this season with another practicing med student but when she cheats on him with ross there is tension carter also gets in trouble with hicks when he spends his lunchbreak boozing it up carol hathaway julianna margulies this is a great season for carol as well she spends pretty much the whole year dating the local ambulance driver chep and their relationship propels the year forward after the tragic death of rowall the other ambulance driver this is a noteable season because there is not even a hint of romance between doug ross and hathaway as she spends the whole year dating ron rifkin jeannie boulet gloria reuben boulet was the new addition to the cast in season two and what an addition she was in my opinion one of the most underrated characters ever on er '' jeannie has a very exciting year she has an affair with benton and ends up divorcing her husband al but near the end of the season she finds out that al has been diagnosed with aids and in the finale she has herself tested we do n't find out the results until season three however peter benton eriq la salle a big year for benton as he gets ross into some major trouble but then pays the price when he finds out some naughty information about a local doctor vucelich and chooses not to tell the administration all in all an amazing year the good thing about this season is that every character gets something noteable my favorite of the cast this year would definately be sherry stringfield her story is unforgettable and it 's a shame that the great writing could n't stay with her character when she returned from once again the dvd set is excellent and shows a lot of care the widescreen transfers are nifty and give it such a cinematic look and the special features are pretty generous too this just might be the finest season of er '' ever the storylines are totally gripping and addicting just trying watching one episode and resisting the urge to watch the rest ! nearly impossible ! buy this set now
wow i did n't think it poossible but several episodes are shot differently and catch your attention explicitly as good as the first mainly do to the chemistry of the original characters still is not seen in today 's episodes making these first two seasons invaluable to those who liked er from the very beginning
the great and elusive ron eldard guest starred as shep the paramedic in season 2 of er he steals every scene he is in watch it for early clooney and great character work from eldard
i thoroughly enjoyed the first season of er '' and the second season did not disappoint me either if i had a problem with the series it was in the different problems that the producers cook up for the main characters of course it 's fascinating watching the choices that each character makes but the problems are becoming more and more debaucherous it would be nice to see positive character development instead of the constant angst that seems to be mounting underneath the surface watching er '' is like eating chocolate it 's good in doses but too much at a time can leave a bad taste in your mouth but i would say the purchase is worth the cost
the second season of er was great high action and drama with some comedy thrown in it made me want to rush out and get the third seaso
and even today it still delivers the same impact that it did then the acting of the main characters is superb and their ability to deliver drama the way it is written and the way it should be is truly a gift to all fans of this show i found myself watching episode after episode of this season as well as seasons 1 and 3. season 4 needs to come out soon so as i can continue watching this series in order

the gift is a film about annie wilson a young woman with very real telepathic talents widow and mother of three annie wilson makes her living by foretelling others ' futures though her own has become cloudier than even she can see threatened by a client 's violently jealous husband and plagued by visions of a missing annie is unwittingly pulled into a thicket of lies and deception in which her extraordinary gift could be used against her and get her knew someone who was gifted and from what i can tell the movie was pretty accurate and the musical score just heavenly
this is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around which is a shame since director sam raimi just before hitting the jackpot with the '' franchise has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie i was in a town on the southernmost tip of chile when i first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have hbo not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the tv set back then by billy bob thornton upon whose mother 's psychic gifts the story is based and tom epperson the plot revolves around the disappearance of jessica starlet the daughter of a wealthy resident of a georgia backwater town tired of blind alleys the police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson a single mother of three sons who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading teller annie thinks she finds a suspect in donnie barksdale the abusive husband of one of her most devoted customers valerie complicating matters for annie is her attraction to wayne collins her eldest son 's teacher and jessica 's fiancee and buddy cole another of annie 's customers a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child while it 's not perfectly constructed the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters ' voices and motivations throughout raimi 's expert direction is full of sumptuous southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story credit needs to be given to jamie anderson 's cinematography and neil spisak 's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns including katie holmes as the spoiled debutante jessica greg kinnear as the seemingly stalwart wayne keanu reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant donnie and giovanni ribisi as the deeply troubled buddy in the smallish role of valerie hilary swank makes her moments count as she cringes from donnie 's scarifying dominance over her but it 's the wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together with her performance as annie with a convincing southern accent she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us the dvd is short on extras a featurette which includes cast and crew interviews the movie 's trailer and a video of neko case 's furniture room lullaby '' which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric thriller that does not condescend to the viewer
this movie has great casting the actors play characters that they usually do n't play this may be the best acting i have ever seen keeanu reeves do
the gift is a riveting very movie about a woman named annie blanchett who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons she gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town one of her clients swank who you can always count on for a remarkable performance has an abusive husband reeves fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here who thinks what annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again then the daughter holmes of an important man goes missing she 's engaged to a man named wayne who works at the school where annie 's boys go i believe he is the principal but i could be mistaken sorry but in any event played by greg kinnear but there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale and soon the police with no clues as to where the daughter is turn to annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction i wo n't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen the gift look for an amazing giovanni ribisi in the substory as well he 's terrific here if you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot the gift is something you will surely treasure as i have even if you question the validity of psychic readings this is a very interesting movie that 's best viewed with an open mind very recommended
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated it has a great story line and plot although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one i really enjoyed this one has quite a few twists as well
i do n't know if i 'd say this is a very creepy film like the ring '' and almost scary but it certainly is strange starting with the plot annie wilson cate blanchett is a psychic who 's gift '' is to see the future what has recently happened in a certain place and she reads cards to the local people when someone she knows mysteriously disappears no one can find her sooner or later after she is found dead the ghost of this woman haunts annie and this gift '' is like something to protect annie and her family but in the process the following situations become somewhat disturbing as the movie goes on because the acting and the cast are very well done the characters make you have opinions about them this movie is just so weird it 's pretty tough to explain every detail but then i 'd be spoiling it would n't i
the gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by billy bob thornton the talented man that also wrote sling blade first off it is impossible for anyone to give this movie less than 3 stars why because of the incredible cast here you 'll find probably one of the best casts ever it has cate blanchett hilary swank greg kinnear an actor whom i ca n't remeber his name but who is brilliant and keannu reeves keannu reeves a good actor damn straight he was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor i am not kidding his performance was remarquable ! the movie is about a widow mother of 3 making her money as a psychic but she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything this psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person and only one you 'll find that one out on your own this movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat so watch this brilliant movie that i will definitely add to my collection
if you are a sam raimi fan then you know that his old car is always featured somewhere in his movies this movie is great in every aspect but especially because if features the classic '' which is what sam calls this car in almost every scene this adds a touch of comic delight to a very tense and suspenceful movie this role is usually filled by bruce campbell but in lieu of his precense the classic '' is a worthy stand in all kidding aside this is an excellent movie and well worth your time keanu reeves gives an excellent turn as a creepy wife beater cate blanchet is as always flawless every role is excellently cast and acted with skill by all sam 's direction is always great and this is no exception
for what it is this movie is great very not typical of a robin williams film but that 's just my opinion i have seen robin do so much from comedy to this i was very impressed with his acting he made the movie and played the character perfectly plot this movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer 's family at the photo place he works at after he is found out the movie really starts to get interesting cy '' robin williams does a variety of things to give off that freaky stalker vibe '' and in the end i really appreciate the orginiality of this movie and i truly think it was an underdated release pro 's of course robin williams acting in the film original line cons was n't the best quality sort of low budget overall i was very pleased with this release it 's probably cheap enough now that to buy it would be worth it for any true robin williams fan indeed
this was a creepy thriller starring robin williams which came out a few years ago rw plays a clerk in a store where he 's the film guy and has been for a very long time he becomes obsessed with one particular family who come in a lot for film development and he begins to fantasize about being part of that family he then discovers a family secret which sends him over the edge williams does a good and disturbing job playing a quietly disturbed man
for me this movie is good to watch at night robin williams plays a photo developer a very lonly person who is obcessed with a young family and he steals copies of their photos he processes for them and hangs it on his wall in his half empty appartment he has crazy fantasys of him being part of that family he stalks the kid and the mother and his store manager finds out he is stealing photos so he lets him go and he gets so depressed and before he leaves he finds pictures of the womans husband cheating on her so he switches the photos for the woman to see and the best part i liked was when sy breaks in their hotel and pretends he is taking pornographic pictures best drama movi
robin willams ' performance carries the lackluster film it was a very disturbing turn as sal a creepy photo guy from the pharmacy that takes a obession too far with a family that regularly comes in he immerses himself into the family and calls himself uncle sal the atmosphere was great and creepy and haunting when you get done with the film willams ' peformance will creep the hell out of you also when the hotel scene comes up be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie i highly recommend the film if you want to watch robin willams peform a serious role outstandingly
a truly great performance by robin williams as the lonely guy who desperately wants to be more than just a average photo developer he fantasize about being a family member which develop into dramatic and frightning consequences for the part involved seen from a psychological point of view this is not just pure entertainment it reflect todays society in many ways solitariness there are surely many lonely out there although not as extreme maybe is study in human condition and it involves the viewer into territories of reflection about himself as a human this movie has moments that stays with you forever
one hour photo many people have covered the film 's plot i wo n't bore you with restating what many have already covered well my take on this film is a little different a persual of the reviews below i do n't see this angle discussed its regarding sy 's damage the film 's ending makes the most powerful statement that statement is damage of children by their parents sy 's whole rationale for his frightening acts in the hotel were simple yorkin was n't a good husband and father the emotional outburst about photos of children and things they should n't have to do said it all sy was n't monster but a person who is really scarred the expierences of his childhood made him a mess and unable to interact normally with people at the end of the film i really felt for him he became a wounded and damaged individual who had a normal life stripped away young his obsession with the yorkin 's was based on the desire for a life he could never have the film and narrative are well done and paced it feels sort of like a documentary the creepy rogers tone plays well there are the people who will see sy 's actions and place emphasis on them lost in those views is what the writers were really saying about one man specifically this one man a man who is a abuse survivor and carries that deep damage i did n't much care for the final scenes instead of the yorkin 's home safely as the closer adding sy being helped as the final scene would 've been much more effective speaking for myself i wanted to see sy get some help then pay for his crimes
the particular and sick affective world of the primordial profile of the peeping tom is to spy secretly behind windows from the security boasted by the darkness but the actual technology certainly allows to scrutinize with major intensity the particular spheres of other affective and emotional worlds this serious affective disorder will constitute the dramatic axis around robin williams an insipid and minuscule human being filled of loneliness and hungry of affection willl fill his boring and non sense life this is precisely what it happened with this original study around a isolated man who connects himself with the outer world just because his work demands it his personal fantasies fly in the wings of his febrile imagination that is the way he gets inside into the particular universe of a middle there will be interesting twists and turns in this thriller that could have been even better
when it all comes down to it all you have is family and when you do n't have family you dont have anything a very deep and symbolisim strewn debut a man is as fragile as a cracking windshield who returns home in the same rinse lather repeat he does everyday like a hamster in a wheel it 's probably the person you least expect ! '' says homer simpson on sy 's robin willams television no one ever takes a photograph of something they wish to forget '' not a film that i soon will
robin williams plays seymour sy '' parrish a meek lonely technician who has worked at a savmart '' store for many years and takes great pride in his work sy does n't have much of a life outside of work he has no friends or family and eats his meals at a local diner but he loves photographs over the years he has followed the progress of a local family the yorkins through all of the pictures they bring to him to develop and sy has a growing fantasy about becoming a member of that seemingly idyllic family the fantasy grows to obsession and sy makes an extra copy of all of their pictures to take home to his tiny apartment to cover one entire wall but then things start to go very wrong sy gets caught making extra copies the machine 's do not match plus sy discovers a flaw in the yorkin family with his fantasy and his job slipping away from him sy becomes quite unstable and takes very desperate actions to try to make things right again this is a very creepy movie in the same way that fargo '' portrayed a person with enormous problems just beneath the surface one hour photo '' makes the viewer wonder what insanity he or she has stared in the face perhaps repeatedly without ever being able to see it alfred hitchcock 's the birds '' also showed us how true horror does not have to come from monsters but can be in the shape of sparrows gulls and crows other films have tried to portray this but done it poorly the has become a cliche and never seems believable in one hour photo '' we see a truly believable character who drifts toward doing truly horrific acts for reasons that are simultaneously irrational and understandable robin williams is astounding in this role we saw him do dramatic parts in what dreams may come '' and dead poets society '' but one hour photo '' is an performance in the first scene i actually thought is that robin williams '' he is the epitome of nondescript bland inoffensive innocuous and he is not just ordinary he blends into the wallpaper the cinematography clothing and set design all enhance this effect in one of the dvd special features you get to see him rapidly and abruptly switch back and forth between robin the irrepressible and sy the invisible truly amazing as you might surmise i highly recommend this one wow
a very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general i wish some brave person would do a film about how christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective this film touched on the subject but it was not really the focus of the we will be blessed '' by a further exploration of the subject in the future
i think that every christian in america should watch this film this documentary focuses on what every christian wants to ignor about god and the bible
this is not in my opinion for really overweight people i liked it but had a really hard time with it
this dvd is great for a beginner to learn the basic moves of pilates and then progress towards doing the more advanced workouts good explanations
this was the pilates dvd i bought and the only one that i actually use on a regular basis it 's done at a really good pace and there are several workouts to choose from so i can always fit it in since i 've been doing these workouts i do n't have a sore back after my walks and now that i can see my muscles and starting to have definition so if you want to look and feel like your weight loss is actually getting you somewhere then get this pilates dvd and do it
i was a little surprised at how challening the workouts on the dvd were until i realized that there are multiple options and tons of variety a full workout is very tough and i would probably only recommend that for intermediates or advance overall the workouts push you hard and do their best to stimulate actual class work defintely recommend for those that want a results driven workouts
the routines are pretty good clear and easy to follow the dvd does stop at different times thru the routine which turns out to be an advantage because you get a moment to catch your breadth
my kid likes to watch movies a lot i 've seen almost all of the baby einstein movies tons of elmo 's world you name it and we 've seen it too much most of these movies teach and entertain our children but few keep us adults in the mix however when this dvd goes in i actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then i ever expected laurie 's voice is phenomenal and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes the harmonies show that this could be an everyday band if they were to go that path my daughter sings the songs and dances which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the tv she loves this dvd from beginning to end and she is n't alone the only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy i have them in my head when i am trying to get stuff done at work ! under a shady tree you and me '' hahaha i could n't recommend this more to a parent with young children
my son is 14 months and absolutley loves to watch and dance to this video i highly recommend it
i 'm so glad we bought this my youngest son 2 days from 2 ! asks for ooowa oooowa ! his favourite part of walk along the river '' his older brothers 6 and 8 dance and sing with him to the entire dvd which is a rare achievement my hubby and i have privately and jokingly cursed the catchiness of these tunes but are thrilled to have at least one disc our toddler will watch all the way through only my is sad she can not believe the laurie berkner band has only one dvd
we received this as a gift for my old daughter 's birthday we loved it from the very first viewing ! laurie suzy and brian are not only talented but also appear to be very fun while many children 's music cds tend to drive me crazy i really do enjoy listening to this with my kids
my two grandchildren were completely entertained with this dvd laurie berkner is very charming and personable and the entire dvd is very colorful definitely a good choice heathe
my 1 yr old loves this dvd she loves to dance and clap along to the songs she is even starting to learn some of the words from the songs i would highly recommend this dvd to any parents with young children
my granddaughter loves this dvd when i turn it on no matter what room she is in she comes a running to watch it i wish that there was more dvd 's of laurie berkner band
my son was saying laurie laurie '' before a lot of other words he loves this music when he watches the dvd he gets up and dances in the car when we listen to the dvd he kicks his feet in delight
my son is obsessed with this video ! i do n't know a child who is n't my only complaint is that she does n't have more out there
my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around ! the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great simple music but very creative i signed up for updates on laurie berkner 's website so i can find out she ever comes to town so my daughter and i of course can go see her she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters who i do n't care much for i have bought this combo for all of my friends who have kids
yes i do agree with many of the viewers that the book by hunter thompson is better however i still found terry gilliams ' wild and strange send up of the hunter thompson novel to be a great film nevertheless much improved from bill murray 's earlier attempt johnny depp gave an excellent performance however it was the character of gonzo benecio del toro as the totally whacked out lawyer that i really found funny funny in a very dark way this film may not appeal to many viewers however it appealed to me i thought the characters of depp and benecio del toro intriguing and hilarious plus some of the other character actors in the film were pretty darn funny as well i can understand some people not liking the film as terry gilliam is not one of the easiest directors to follow especially his vision of directing moreover when depp and benecio del toro arrive in las vegas the entire feel of the film gets really strange thank terry gilliam for this as i wrote before the book is much better however the film is great too ! yes there is a lot of drug use in the film one of the major complaints of many reviewers i guess they do n't know the life of hunter thompson or his samoan lawyer they were both drug abusers furthermore i did not expect them to drink and lemonade while they were both on assignment so if the extensive drug abuse upsets you this is not the film for you however the film contrary to some viewers is funny at least in a dark way if you do n't want to purchase the dvd especially the criterion collection of the film rent it first to see if it is your taste however i thought it was a great film and it is highly recommended
as all pf us are aware about terry gilliam 's border limits scripts the repercussions and tendencies that occur product of a progressive crumbling of the human mind there us a visible breakthrough respect the established order and the way to respond before this anomaly vary according the case in particular this movie may disturb most of viewers in case you are not totally immersed in the spirit of that age plenty of absolute lack of respect and negation of basic premises do n't forget the famous french may 's ideological emblem forbidden to forbid '' caustic acidic and uncensored gaze around these outlaw period of a recent history that now is part of the anthological retrospective all the cast was absolutely superb and the movie reflected with absolute veracity the essential profiles of its hallucinating characters
a reporter and his psychopathic lawyer go to las vegas in order to report on motorcycle race on just about every drug imaginable under the sun that 's pretty much the plot and the glory of fear and loathing is not its plot but it 's journey is it one long joke about the misperceptions paranoia and lunacy that happen while under lysergic influence yeah and it is brilliant it is a film worth seeing because it not only demonstrates to the closest i 've seen on film at least just what a trip '' is like but also it is a reflection on the transition of the late 60 's to the early 70 's and the american dream '' which those in las vegas so desperately seek to acheive johnny depp masterfully channels the persona of hunter thompson in fact i keep forgetting during the film that it 's johnny depp a sign of great acting and benicio del torro plays gonzo '' is a way that is a combination of humorous curious and frightening the criterion collection did extreme justic to the transfer of the film both audio and visual and the extras are worth the time at 29 bucks it is a costly venture but well worth the trip
i was one of the few that actually saw fear and loathing in las vegas '' not because of any affinity for hunter thompson who i had never heard of before forgive me i was fourteen but after seeing this movie which is best described as a flawed masterpiece '' i immediatley became a fan of the man as i am still a fan of this movie fear and loathing '' the movie is n't flawless as at times it can get repetitive and i wholly understand the people who say that this movie is nothing but mayhem on film and passed as art this is not a picture for everyone and the people who do not like it are not wrong and do n't neccesarrily not get it '' this movie is made a certain audience the movie is good do not let the above paragraph distract you because it is expertly directed by terry gilliam he of monty python '' and brazil '' fame who brings his slightly okay totally skewred perspective and skills to this film and the two lead performances from johnny depp who is flawless as raoul duke '' a thompson psuedonym a performance that is n't just mimicry even though at first it may seem that way and benicio del toro as gonzo who some feel is a little over the top but to me fits the vibe anarchy for all vibe that the film has features wise this is another top notch effort from crtiterion featuring three commentaries with gilliam one with depp and del toro and with the man thompson himself deleted scenes trailers tv spots an audio recording of gilliam discussing the controversy over the screenwriting credit tons of footage with thompson and a funny section of johnny depp reasing his and thompson 's correspondence with one another the movie itself looks great possibly even better than it looked in theaters if you have yet to see fear and loathing '' well you may wan na watch it before you buy it but if you dig the flick on any level then this dvd is a must purchase
terry gilliam and johnny depp made as good a film as they could with hunter thompsons book which was long considered impossible to translate to the screen i think the people who slam this movie would hate anything by hunter thompson anyway in order to please them you would have to alter thompsons bizzare original vision so much that there would be no purpose in making the movie by the way did anyone but me notice that in the out of control in vegas '' flashback scenes that drew carey and diedrich oswald '' bader are in the crowd that is confronting duke and gonzo in a parking lot
one of the best movies made if youve never seen it what are you waiting for this is a great movie and with criterion releasing it your sure to get the best along with a disc of features criterion is best when releasing the best movies
wow i just viewed spun '' the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous this is sort of a movie but you want to take shower afterwards spun '' has an impressive cast of recognized actors the film is essentially about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts there is the cook mickey rourke he truly makes this story worth watching who makes the drug speed and sells it to spider mike john leguizamo a dealer with a junkie girlfriend cookie mena suvari looking infinitely less attractive than she did in american beauty '' one of his clients is ross jason schwartzman who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend nikki brittany murphy i was surprised at how funny the film was at times it does n't drown us in messages nor does it become one of those equally tedious drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party the humour is dark certainly but funny nevertheless a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee patrick fugit who is caught by a couple of tv policemen peter stormare and alexis arquette and is told he will be let off if he helps them get i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead this is a film with a lot of energy that seems like its characters not entirely sure where it is going but determined to get there and quickly although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too the director jonas has directed music videos in the past and it shows in his impatient filming style as he plays around with animation camerawork and such like i 'm not recommending the film for its style though although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen i am recommending it because i liked the main characters which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki or spider mike and cookie or even just ross who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for what makes spun '' better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community and we feel as if we are watching their everyday speeded up sleepless lives simply amazing
john leguizamo is hilarious and the movie has its very funny quirky unusual moments not a ground breaker but in your face spoof of dirty white trash junkie movies lots of dirty jokes just plain nasty for those inquiring minds the only reason i gave this movie five stars is because of a scene with john leguizamo on the phone with a 800 number girl naked with a tube sock mena suvari on the toilet asking for toilet paper and the cops about to break in the crack house if thats not funny then comedy is overrated
spun is an absolute pleasure to watch it does n't wait around to get noticed instead it sets it 's own pace like for example no credits roll in the beginning no apologetic character introductions there is no stop sign in this film everything is unhooked and raw yet nothing seems to be out of place the direction is bizzare camerawork is staggering at places the sets are like gutters the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level there are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too the reason i compare spun with run lola run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the german wonderflick was spun is possibly one of a kind i enjoyed it more than i enjoyed trainspotting now that is saying a lot unfortunately i have n't seen many movies like spun in hollywood so i have no recommendations this is an absolute must watch if there ever was one
there are dozens of do n't do drugs flicks that feel like specials with their sluggish morals and predictable endings well i can say that the ending of this movie was predictable but the to it the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented voices going in and out of focus characters in fast forward teeth grinding had me spun from beginning to end though brittany murphy gets most of the cover the story is really about ross jason schwartzmann a part of a extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines including secondhand dealer spider mike john leguizamo game geek frisbee patrick fugit and others when ross meets nikki murphy he gets hooked up to the real deal a man that calls himself the cook who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits fights and tweaks like a man the movie for the most part follows ross 's exploits as he becomes the cook 's errand boy ferrying nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet who has turned green from too much inhalation and otherwise taking the cook out to score buy beer and porn etc the best part about this movie is the behavior of the junkies they hug and kiss you they reassure you with pretty lies they make you feel right at home but the second they 're short on drugs or you say the wrong thing to them they scream and throw things around the next day you 're friends again until the next fight which is never very far off and though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the cook is the head cheese it is interesting and accurate to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger and yuck is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters their teeth are gritty their clothes dirty and raggedy and through the few days we follow them it does n't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower all they want no need is their next fix the part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up based on truth and lies
'spun ' follows the lives of several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted roller coaster days but this is not your ordinary 'drug ' film the ambience and atmosphere is so with this degenerated culture that you can smell the illegal drugs cooking giving the plot away would be moot since it is a portrayal of everyday life for people of this particular scene so what separates 'spun ' from the rest of the drug flicks gritty realism hilariously bizarre scenes atmosphere some great acting and a complete lack of fear on the part of the creator and the director to dive into the nastiest of behaviors and expose them as pathetic and comical the sets are what you will see in real life meth houses the dress and behavior of the characters is very realistic my only real problem with the movie is that some of the camera work gets a little annoying but still serves its purpose of bringing the tweak '' to the screen interspersed in the film are some ridiculous cartoon scenes that are a riot and two cops that parody tv shows like cops '' and bounty hunters '' along with flash stills and hilarious action music i am going to be haunted forever by the spider mike john leguizamo scene where he is jumping up and down on the bed with a sock on his unit while abusing himself you 'll see what i mean leguizamo is brilliant in his role mickey rourke has proven himself to be quite an actor a chameleon who can adapt to any role in 'spun ' he plays the cook a nasty loosing white trash cowboy type who cooks the dope for the gang watch for ross 's jason schwartzman hallucination of the cook 's speech in the video store ask not what the kitty can do for you substitute the 'p ' word for kitty but what you can do for the kitty '' look for a surprising performance from brittany murphy just married sin city as nikki the more i see of brittany 's work the more i like her as an actress eric roberts playing the man may have had one bad role after another but his part in 'spun ' is perfect for him and very well done the man with his earring and his muscle boys and his overdone lisp was too funny to watch roberts worked with rourke in 'the pope of greenwich village ' back in the early 80 's and its plain that they still mesh as actors watch for debra harry 80 's group blondie as ross 's nosy neighbor and ron jeremy the king of as the bartender in the strip club all in all 'spun ' is a movie with a serious twist that will leave you laughing in the wake of the character 's bizarre activities this is one of the best behavior movies i have watched right up there with 'requiem for a dream ' and 'kids ' truly a movie enjoy !
this movie takes you on a ride of a lifetime its pure entertainment as its cast of characters leave you shaking your head saying to yourself ill pass on the line of meth
i love this movie it 's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment where is the soundtrack to this movie
i 'm new to the practice of dvd provides a powerful insight to its practice and depth of purpose it is easy to follow and quickly absorbs one in the flow of using qigong in one 's life
i purchased david garripoli 's vhs a few years ago and i realized benefits from the first session of doing the wuji swimming dragon '' i first realized the sensation in the my crown chakra i also felt that all important burst of energy that comes along with the appropriate and correct practive of qigong the directions are easy enough for a child to follow and garripoli gives the historical background to this treasured martial art i would and frequently do recommend qigong to all for it 's health benefits but for it 's uplifting spiritual benefits
i would have expected this many exercises to be split among three dvds and there is a bonus backgrounder it 's like getting four dvds for less than the price of one this is informative energizing relaxing and i received all of the exercises i wanted and more i would recommend it to anyone
this is a great dvd the extra documentary discusses the history and current use of qigong with actual footage of the masters in china i found the qigong easy to follow and to work into my personal schedule it breaks it up into several simple areas and if i do n't have time for the complete session i can do the areas i need most i am a reiki master and i wished to broaden my energy work this was really useful i am also struggling to learn accupressure and qigong in a 100 hr introductory class this helped learning several of the movements my instructor was also trying to teach to observe qigong practised well reminds me of watching ballet as it is very graceful with rounded movements that are enjoyable to watch and practice as a nurse i am interested in energy work and exercise that can maintain health flexibility balance and strength that complements western medicine qigong can be a powerful tool to acheive this i really enjoy this dvd as it is very well presented i highly reccomend it !
this is my first introduction to qigong and found the documentary dvd and actual instruction very informative and easy to follow i have been starting my mornings by following along with one or more segments depending on how much time i have and then moving on to the next segments on following days if you are interested in qigong i would definitely recommend starting out here
as a beginner i am so glad i found this dvd i do n't even mind the hour and a half long workout ! the movements are easy to understand and follow and qigong has '' my body back to health ! when i do n't have time to practice all 18 movements i do the short version that is provided at the beginning ! thank you garrapolis
good introduction to qigong mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful overall relaxing and precise
i do n't really buy the whole chi '' healing power but it is very good for concentration and relaxation the tape is very long an hour and one half and seems to be pretty well made
this is a great introduction to the world of qigong exercise and meditation the most valuable part of the set for me was the dvd with the documentary on qigong i never knew that qigong is a term and concept that embraces varied styles and methods of exercise and healing i learned from the documentary that even the playing of music and chinese brush painting can be a form of qigong exercise and healing the quality of the photography and demonstration is good and easy to follow the movements are slow and relaxed but i wish there was a view of the exercises or at least a side and rear view of the movements it was hard to understand the proper posture and stance of the exercises just from the frontal viewpoint another limitation of the instruction is that it does not provide a graphic illustration of the location of the energy centers dan tian and the path flow of energy throughout the body i know qigong is an internal as well as a physical form of exercise and it would have been helpful to know how the exercises direct and distribute energy flow through the body i wanted to know exactly where the dan tian energy centers are and the way the exercises move energy through them that would have helped me to understand the purpose of the exercises and given me something to visualize and concentrate on while doing the exercises
this is a very dvd that offers a solid introduction to the art of qigong no one video is going to achieve great depth in a complex subject but having seen a number of qigong videos many of which have production qualities and very minimal explanations i would rank this as one of the best particularly for a new student the qigong forms presented here offer slow dynamic stretching deep gentle breathing and they are enjoyable and relaxing to perform the second dvd presents a fascinating documentary on the history of qigong well worth the modest cost
the harts max and freeway made this one of the best series from the chemistry between wagner and powers exploded on the modern day version of the thin man series of yester year with william powell and merna solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get without the help of max who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with shirley temple can not wait for the third season dvd
why did robert wagner have a black eye throughout the first few episodes that not even makeup could hide
at last the eagerly awaited second series of hart to hart has hit the shelves this series contains one of the classic episodes of the show 'what murder ' where jonathan loses his memory forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious jennifer fabulous stuff the quality of the transfers is good not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to ! the two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes the covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box but hey it 's the contents that counts and you do n't get much better than this ! roll on series three and please sony we need a commentary on 'hart of darkness'
i remember the the 70 's well this show was my absolute favorite show i loved the chemistry between robert wagner and stefanie powers it came so naturally that they did n't have to work at it you just knew they were having fun doing the show ! ! who does n't dream of having more money than they could ever spend and also having the choice of whether to work or not ! ! let 's not forget max who took care of them he sure had his hands full ! he was more family than servant and we loved him just as much he just added to the show 's charm tv these days has become so much more serious and reality based what fun to lose yourself in a show that was full of fun charm and bit of crime solving too ! the show may seem dated nowadays but who cares ! it 's still a lot of fun to watch my favorite episodes from this season were the one where jonathon lost his memory and the one where he played his own uncle fritz von hart what fun ! ! i ca n't wait to get this dvd set hopefully it wo n't be another year before season 3 is released
i was just a kid when this show was on and i loved every episode of it back then it looked sleek chic exciting everything you could ask for from a tv show just like charlie 's angels or vega i remember them all almost 30 years later it looks so dated so different from today 's fast paced violent loud tv still we love it the stories are so simple and wagner and powers had so much charm so much style let me add that today i guess i still secretly dream about having a 1978 yellow wagon with that big telephone laughs it used to be so super cool ! ! ! wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 kid just being introduced to late 70 's television the jokes the kitchens the hairdos the telephones vcrs big cars disco oh and i loved mark snow 's theme i recognized it instantly and max 's introduction to and h whose hobby is murder ! ! ! do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class ' during the late 70 's watch hart to hart everything was great everything was ideal ! what a great show ! thanks for the memory ps someday someone will write a history of american society through the century 's tv shows ' point of view i 'm sure hart to hart charlie 's angels moonlighting magnum pi and many many others will all have a lot to say a classic ! ! ! ! !
for five wonderful seasons hart to hart '' was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble robert wagner and stefanie powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders they were jonathan and jennifer hart living the fun life we all wished we had the chemistry between stefanie powers and robert wagner was natural and you could always tell especially with wagner that they were having a ball sidney sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast wagner and powers wagner took his cool alexander munday persona from it takes a thief '' and just made him richer and happier with a lovely companion he got to keep stefanie powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part until hart to hart jennifer hart came so naturally that you could n't help thinking she was n't really acting at all come to think of it the same could be said of robert wagner 's seemingly effortless turn as jonathan hart this was heaven for light mystery fans there was always plenty of fun banter between jonathan and h '' and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week 's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit was lionel stander 's role as their butler max max was much more like family than hired help and in the show 's opening every week you knew right away max was an important part of the proceedings after introducing the millionaire jonathan and his other boss h max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them because their hobby was murder ! not to be forgotten of course was their lovable dog freeway who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet the stories were frivilous fun as this was n't real danger just tv danger and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end fans of the show were delighted when the first season of this fun show finally got a dvd release and are once again made happy by the release of season two a lot happened in the second season as the show just kept getting better jonathan had amnesia after an accident and forgot a murder in one episode in another jennifer was kidnapped max 's showed up and caused tons of trouble and jennifer was stalked by a mummy when a not so ancient body was found in an egyptian sarcophagus ! hart to hart '' was delightful escapist fare mark snow 's hart to hart '' theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy and fans looked forward to hearing it every week snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for the '' the episodes for season two are as follows murder murder on the wall what murder this lady is murder murder is man 's best friend 't is the season to be murdered murder wrap murder in paradise can be murder murder is a drag murder slow boat to murder murder in the saddle homemade murder solid gold murder getting aweigh with murder the murder of jonathan hart the latest in high fashion murder operation murder murder takes a bow blue chip murder the domestic and mystery adventures of the man jonathan and his wife jennifer made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure the adventures of the spohisticated couple who it turned out were just like us only rich was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day and still is every tv mystery fan will want to pick this one up so pop the cork from the champagne in the limo call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting and jot off to tv land where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure for a second season great fun
this was one of the finest written and acted shows ever on television the stories were truthful and heartbreaking the characters flawed and likable it is a shame for the fans of o a to have to wait years between the release of the 3 seasons of this show especially when you see so many shows of let 's say it lesser quality '' like the dukes of hazzard '' has seven seasons released buena vista this is just sad release season 3 for the fans of the show puhleeeeeeze
watching once and again '' is one of the most painful television shows to watch let along watch again this is not because it is a bad television show but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date i would like to be able to identify with rick but my personal situation is more like that of jake and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them watching once and again the complete second season '' on dvd the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning there is a moment when she reads her parents lily and jake the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace but also ending up with less years where the family scribbling rivalry '' anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again if you have been spared that particular experience then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through if the first season of once and again '' is about lily manning and rick sammler falling in love then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and to a new level of acceptance there is actually more abut lily and her new job scribbling rivalry '' and rick working on a for miles drentell edifice wrecked '' than there is about them being with each other while lily and rick are happy for the most part everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again feast or famine '' the major irony is that the dyad i am most interested in is karen and jessie especially knowing what is going to happen to karen in the third season and what evan rachel wood has done since this show ended although i am equally impressed by julie whalen as a young actress as well so i tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing albeit for different reasons but with more of an appreciation of how jessie is her mother 's daughter which is not always a good thing best of enemies '' especially since jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating food for thought '' having miles drentel is a mixed blessing because while watching david clennon is always a pleasure when he becomes a wedge between rick and david it is like watching michael and elliot on thirtysomething '' all over again but it does inspire a true moment of vision for rick ozymandias 2.0 '' and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having miles around is to bring rick down to the point that all he can offer lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot this becomes important because it means rick and lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe let alone live but dramatically the whole bit of karen and her law firm trying to stop miles and rick from building their project is more interesting edifice wrecked '' especially when it seems rick might end up going to prison wo n't someone please help george bailey tonight '' when the psychiatrist that jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as rick and karen get at each other it seems so obvious this really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun the other end of the telescope '' but bails on tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby forgive us out trespasses '' judy comes up with the great idea of booklovers '' despite lily 's negativity but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out will gluck eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music i ca n't stand up for falling down '' but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue note why rick and karen wasted time letting eli apply to the university of illinois at is beyond me because i have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this december i have to tell you that unless eli is going on a basketball scholarship he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation so my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into eli 's parents or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation my only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that lily is really way too judgmental at least when she does not immediately accept rick 's proposal another painfully true moment for me she does not leave him hanging for long and i liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring the fact that season two ends with the wedding the second time around '' might seem like the end of the story but only if you make the mistake of thinking once and again '' was simply about lily getting remarried it really is about trying to make two families one which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final and incomplete season to come out on dvd
buena vista home entertainment you stink as a studio where is season 3 on dvd of once and again
i miss this show so much once and again was such a great show with a cast sela ward billy campbell evan rachel wood shane west and the rest of the cast played these characters with authenticity and strength wood went on to star in the incredible film thirteen i just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season in the second season of once and again her charater jessie struggles with anorexia her scenes are so touching and raw what a gifted young actress she was the main reason i tuned in every week just remarkable sela ward is good in everything she is in my fave episode is the thanksgiving episode patrick dempsey guest starred as ward 's mentally challenged brother from time to time i hope the third season gets released but i doubt it all the finest shows on get the ax way too soon it 's a shame buy this you wo n't regret it
sorry dallas the final episode of once and again '' was not a two hour event it was a regular episode that aired april 15 2002 as part of a truncated from 23 episodes down to 19 third season it ended with the fourth wall being broken and the cast and crew spoke as themselves of what the series meant to them there 's still no word as to when a dvd set of season three will see the light of day i am so disappointed with buena vista over this come on bvhe there 's a real demand for this series if you 're a fan of o a and have n't bought the first two seasons then please do so then maybe season three will finally see the light of day on dvd
in response to sue elkins of bloomington in yes there are only three seasons the show was cancelled in it 's final season due to ratings i remember the last episode when it aired as it was a two hour event season three the final season was scheduled to be released this last january commentary for the final episode has been done in late summer as they had planned and anticipated to get it released right away after the release of season 2. however in late october announcement came out although not too boldly that it 'll be delayed word of it 's new release date have not been annouced as of yet at least not to my knowledge hope this helps and gives you some insight
i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3. where is it i hope that it is released soon it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending ! a little unfair to the consumer do n't you think ! it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is is that correct
this series was just an average series overall however i give it 5 stars because of the superior performance of adorable young evan rachel wood evan has a very bright future ahead of her and will someday be one of the most successful actresses in hollywood just watching evan makes this dvd well worth the purchase price
i was a huge fan of once again 's brand of adult melodrama but it 's worth noting that season 2 was the weak link in its illustrious three years i was never nuts about the miles drentel plotline that dominated rick 's billy campbell year his ambition was interesting enough his crises of conscience and darker side '' were n't as much campbell does a rousing but in truth he was always once 's least interesting character and made a better as a supportive rod in the background than lead i was also not nuts about lily 's stint as trailblazing editor 's assistant not because sela ward 's plotlines were insubstantial for proof take one view of her rabblerousing sexual harrassment episode suspicion '' which likely netted her deserved emmy for the year but because jennifer crystal foley 's christie was always more annoying than welcome but if some of the bigger plot machinations did n't work once again moved hearts left and right with its smaller moments and extraordinary support cast grace the extraordinary underappreciated julia whelan stealing from jessie in spite of herself thieves like us '' judy 's love of salinger and singles ' nights booklovers '' another terrific guest appearance by patrick dempsey aaron 's getting better '' and especially the emergence of evan rachael wood as a major young actress her heartbreaking work in food for thought '' steals the season capping things off appropriately the season ends in second time around '' a wedding episode that 's square earnest and simply so moving your deepest dweeb is unleashed laughing and crying in spite of itself
season 1 and 2 of once and again '' were simply fabulous and great and i was looking forward to getting season 3 on dvd when it was announced for january 2006. now it is suddenly pulled from the release schedule why i sincerely hope that all once and again '' stand up for this and urge buena vista to release season 3 as soon as possible ! !
i ca n't really say anything that has n't already been said this movie is frightening extremely suspenseful revolting and above all undeniably compelling fincher is in fine form regarding the direction of this movie and brad pitt morgan freeman one of the best actors of our time kevin spacey and gwenyth paltrow turn in exceptional performances as the main characters this is easily one of the best films of the and any true fan of motion pictures should add this collector 's edition to their dvd library
this clever and gruesome film was released in theaters in 1995. definitely not for the squeamish but if you can even try to peek through fingers this movie will keep you riveted morgan freeman is a soon to retire police investigator who gets paired with a brad pitt our young hero is married to gwyneth paltrow the idea is vaguely reminiscent of the lethal weapon duo but it 's not a laughing matter the crimes they are investigating are heinous and point to a diabolical serial killer who has a penchant for rendering justice upon those who have committed the seven deadly sins '' kevin spacey is particularly brilliant in his performance as the mad man but all actors shine in this one creating a stark contrast with the gruesomeness nicely done
ohhhh ! i caught this movie on regular tv and even with commercials it was good i bought it so i would get the whole movie i have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family a really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you !
is not only my favorite film of but the one of the few films that gave me hope for the future of filmmaking i love every shot in this masterpiece and concludes with the greatest third act i have ever witnessed if you have not seen this film watch it allow it to change your life
i rate this movie 5 stars or the movie is included among the 1000 best movies on dvd by peter travers this new line platinum series edition is really beautiful with a dvd case simulating the notebook that john doe uses in the movie and with a second disc full of supplemental material i miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory how it was made '' or behind the scenes '' documentary you see deleted scenes and extended takes alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards etc the movie in disc one comes with an audio track specially recorded for the dvd edition and in my home theatre sounds terrific also we have 4 different audio commentaries by director fincher freeman pitt and other collaborators on the film this is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives one new another about to retire after a serial killer always brilliant spacey who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins and kills people who represents them after the murder he turns himself in and the last two envy and wrath are just a masterpiece of an invention i 've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times but i ca n't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story this is a masterpiece of a movie i rarely give points to movies so i gave this to be picky i 'd like a hit '' song with the closing credits but that is just me being picky the music by howard shore is good the photography is excellent the script is in my opinion the very best and morgan freeman and brad pitt are fabulous the movie was nominated for best film editing for the academy awards but won nothing a must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan your collection is not complete without this one and for the price 13.99 while i am writing this you ca n't get any wrong
this chilling bit of film noir features almost unimaginable cruelty graphically expressed what separates it from movies where blood flows like beer at a frat party is that the violence is never gratuitous it is at the very center of the story informing both character and plot is defined by superb art direction and an extremely intelligent script the overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom are reinforced with every carefully managed detail the murder scenes in particular are so meticulously realized they resemble paintings the script sends characters and viewers scampering to the library in an attempt to understand the murderer 's mind the bible milton chaucer and dante all contribute significant plot points this is a film that talks up to its audience the full weight of this fleur du mal rests on the capable shoulders of morgan freeman one of america 's greatest actors his wise world weary and patient performance fully embodies the sense of hopelessness experienced by those who understand evil and can not defeat it brilliant gwyneth paltrow is deceptively effective her fragile beauty and innocence are there to remind us that unlike the early victims who courted their fates by wallowing in sin true evil inevitably destroys the guiltless as well lee ermey the police captain unforgettable as the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is visibly playing the role rather than being the character he is at best but the real tragedy here deadly sin number eight is brad pitt one can not excuse his wretched performance by saying that he is playing an idiot it might be more accurate to say that he lacks the technique and talent to act the part of an idiot and simply being one is not the same thing watch him again and notice his tendency to throw his hands purposelessly as though he is trying to detach them from his arms this ludicrous bit of physicality was carried to an absurd extreme in 12 monkeys the terry gilliam masterpiece kevin spacey who only appears in the third act is nothing short of stunning he manages the impossible challenge of making this larger than life monster real with an ease that seems effortless an amazing achievement for those of you who saw the end coming well there 's always barton fink is a brilliant descent into the dark places of the human soul certainly worth owning
is one of the best crime thrillers of all time and probably has the best cinamatography i 've ever seen the film has the darkest atmosphere and probably influenced a ton of other generic hollywood thrillers and yet remains the only original thriller that manages to creep you out with out having any cliches both morgan freeman and brad pitt were terrific in thier roles as the two detectives and have a tremendous job of making thier characters more than one dimensional you also get to see thier personal lives and then wonder how they do n't get effected by the violence that surrounds them all the grisly murders that occur in the film are based on the seven deadly sins like greed envy sloth ect that are done by a mysterious killer called john doe cause they obviously do n't know his name so the film turns into this ultimate cat and mouse game with a very nice backdrop of the city which looks dark and is constantly raining david fincher does a great job with the direction almost giving it a gothic look overall this film is fantastic and is highly recomended do n't miss it
this is one of the best editions ever being a graphic designer is great to have a high quality item like this on a dvd collection well even if i would n't be a graphic designer i would love this edition of course is not only the amazing '' package or the great amount of detail on it the movie the director the great cast the bonus material and special features makes it one of a kind edition highly recomendable
an outstanding beautifully produced movie with an exceptional cast anyone who enjoys dramas will certainly find this movie quite captivating
the intent of the director was to capture the atmosphere or flavor '' of the elizabethan court intrigue alliances deceit ambitions trechery and emotions in addition he means to show us that elizabeth was a human being thrust into power and all that power demands on those points he got it right although people were not quite as clean and good looking then times were brutal a toothache could kill you lice were everywhere those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point an historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more the movie probably could have been a little longer as it is worthy of multiple viewings
very few historical movies are historically accurate who cares that is not the point if anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons then they are pitiful in the first place the primary purpose of movies is to entertain its likely that anyone interested in 'elizabeth ' is not the run of the mill 'die hard ' fan to begin with and probably has some true historical knowledge those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store
to those of you who have yet to realize what an amazing actress cate blanchett is look no further than 'elizabeth ' the characters the costumes and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able but it 's blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best the story revolves around the rise of the young queen elizabeth i blanchett who would soon become one of england 's most powerful rulers reviled as a heretic by the catholic church surrounded in the midst of traitors and caught up in a romance with a young lord that could jeopardize her crown elizabeth is forced to learn that as a queen she must become untouchable in order to maintain her throne the supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant geoffrey rush but it 's blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene her performance was more than oscar worthy and is surely one of her best some have compared this with in love ' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year both are good films but whereas ' plays generally for laughs elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously there are historical plot holes but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film in fact it seems that hollywood encourages this type of approach these days there are any numbers of unexplained actions and characters are sometimes hard to identify but the camera work color and scenic backgrounds are superb locations are all real and the acting is uniformly convincing if an initial viewing leaves you a tad confused do a little reading on the period see the film again and enjoy it all the more
i love this show i would recommend it to anyone i wish it was still on the air i like that it includes the kids and the
i do not know if i can take another television series created by marshall herskovitz and edward zwick when they came out with thirtysomething '' in 1987 it was like watching our lives on tv i can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of michael hope and the gang then in 1999 they came back with once and again '' and all i can is that i hate to think what would have happened if i was not already where the characters ended up in the third season because if i was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful in fact i would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs twist the knife or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce you might have heard originally the idea with the mary tyler moore show '' was for mary richards to be divorced and they could not get that idea to fly because the networks thought audiences would think laura had divorced rob petrie but divorces are so painful despite their regularity on soap opears that there have been other concerns with having a show that is about divorce once and again '' is more about life and love after divorce and the series dodges a major bullet by making sure the principle couple to be are already divorced and separated respectively when they first meet and sparks start to fly despite the train wrecks that are their lives this television series might be too painful to watch for some i want to be rick but i know i am a lot closer to jake and that conclusion certainly hurts but that is what happens with shows that are real rather than merely being considered reality programming the fortysomethings in the main spotlight are lily manning sela ward who kicked her husband jake jeffrey nordling out of the house for having an affair and architect rick sammler bill campbell who has been divorced for three years from karen susanna thompson lily works at a bookshop with her sister judy brooks marin hinkle while jake runs the restaurant once owned by lily and judy 's father and karen is a lawyer both have two children living with lily are grace julia whelan an awkward high school freshman and young zoe meredith deane who has the ability to ask the pointed question at the wrong moment living with karen but frequently visiting rick are eli shane west a high school junior who plays basketball and has some sort of learning disability and jessie evan rachel wood in the role that first got out attention who is smart thin and working on her black belt in tae kwan doe lily and rick meet at the high school when grace has an injured ankle and eli has academic problems and from the start the couple find they are embarrassments to their children pilot '' rick is clearly smitten and lily is surprised to find herself enjoying a relationship with another man let 's spend the night together '' which is not easy when she finds herself working with his at a school carnival the scarlet letter jacket '' and her sister clearly disapproves of the guy liars and other strangers '' and his involvement in lily 's life a dream deferred '' meanwhile the kids have resorted to parallel euphemisms lily is the mom '' and rick is the dad '' and have to deal with their own teenager crises in terms of sprained ankles the '' out of control parties outside hearts '' and the revolving door of adolescent affection sneaky feelings '' daddy 's girl '' then there are the ups and downs of the love lives of both judy the mystery dance '' and karen '' in the wake of lily and rick 's romance as well as jake 's ongoing involvement with young tiffany ever carradine becoming painfully clear to grace letting go '' there is a major subplot in the first season regarding lily 's father phil paul mazursky who shows up for thanksgiving '' expecting things to be patched up between lily and jake who is clearly more like a son than a to lily 's absolute frustration add to the interpersonal complications which includes lily 's brother aaron patrick dempsey the escalating financial problems of jake that are putting the house that lily and her daughters live in at risk mediation '' and force lily to go out and fin a job my brilliant career '' as for rick herskovitz and zwick introduce him to a new circle of hell when who else but familiar face by miles dentrell david clennon who has relocated to the chicago area from philadelphia the conceit of the series was the use of interview '' segments where the characters admit to themselves things they would never say aloud this matters on once and again '' because getting these characters to say what they are thinking without being prompted by anger or fear is often difficult and our feelings towards grace judy and karen are tempered because of these moments where their pain becomes most clear the season ends with an indication that the genesis for this series might have been the romance between lily and rick but that what it is really going to be about in the next two seasons is how these two families become one while maintaining tangible links to the families they were in the past a door about to open ''
i wish that there would come out with the season of once and again i just love that show soooo much i wish it was still on tv
if you have not seen this series i strongly urge you to give it a try young evan rachel wood is simply the best teenage actress in all of hollywood ! my heart just ached for her as her character dealt with the problems of her parents being divorced evan you are the best
there are very few shows in my lifetime that i have been fiercely loyal to but the now defunct and again ' without question topped that short list i will admit that my lifelong crush on actress sela ward was my main interest in this series originally single with no kids and in my late during o a 's debut i was far out of abc 's target demographic for this show i did n't expect to like the show very much but i got sucked in not because of sela but because the show was nothing less than fantastic superbly acted and superbly written abc never gave this show a chance to find its audience and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it 's all too early demise even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance the premise of the story is of rick samler and lily manning two fortysomething single parents who the adult dating scene after their divorces they fall head over heels for one another and find that life and love in the then late is far different than what they remember adding children careers parents and to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for rick and lily most shows the shark ' at some point during their lifetimes while some could argue that the hostage episode in was that point for o a i disagree once and again always presented two kinds of television good and better the stories and characters could fill you with hope heartbreak or both every week almost without fail and best of all everything about this show was real very little if any suspension of disbelief was required perhaps the best thing i can say about o a is that it is the only show that i was so passionate about saving that i sat down and wrote a letter to abc asking them to reconsider their canceling of it as part of an organized campaign with other fans while the campaign was n't successful the release finally of the series on dvd will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever as well as allow those who did n't get to view o a during its run to discover it and they too might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story
'once and again ' represented to me the highest point in television drama this series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves fine acting brilliant writing exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series intimacy nudity sexuality and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty deep character development was the standard not the exception even for characters that had more peripheral roles the series was genuine i never felt a false moment i was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years apparently mainstream americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work or perhaps after or perhaps abc did not promote it in a proper timeslot regardless my only solace remains that i can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via dvd
and so my course is clear to go through life pretending to have done and seen things that have hardened me made me aloof and unreachable which works until i need to ask a stock boy where they keep their corn meal then the facade crumbles and it 's clear that i 'm not a weathered loner who 's seen too much just a pasty midwesterner who ca n't find the flour aisle '' mike nelson 'movie megacheese' 'once and again ' is about people like this people who live in america 's country have never been homeless are not famous do n't fight crime or work in hospitals do n't shop in soho or beverly hills in real life they vastly outnumber the homicide detectives criminals trauma surgeons and island castaways who comprise such a disproportionate percentage of the central characters on television dramas why two reasons 1 most tv writers think they 're boring and lack the insight and skills to write about them in ways that viewers will find interesting 2 when a show that deals with this kind of material makes it on the air it depends on large numbers of viewers in order to remain in production most television viewers gravitate to sex violence and suspense and combinations thereof and they are addicted to heightened reality they do not have the patience for character studies and that 's why 'once and again ' lasted only three seasons one imagines that it was able to go that long because small but loyal numbers of viewers are actually bored by explosions artificial suspense and mindless exhibitionism now we have 'once and again ' on dvd i doubt there 's ever been more genuine gratitude among fans of a tv show regarding its release on video sure there are a lot of great shows on dvd but they 're usually products that stand to do a lot of volume on dvd and are from a marketing perspective a lot of lousy ones make it to dvd too but does anyone really care about those we spent a long time wondering if 'o a ' would ever meet polycarbonate then later believing that season one would remain alone there that would have been a shame as good as the first season is as a it improves dramatically on subsequent viewings after seeing the second and third seasons in the opening scene of the series lily manning wakes her daughters in a home in a chicago suburb beautiful morning sunlight streams through the windows it 's probably easy to dismiss it and think okay so what '' when you watch it after say wo n't someone please help george bailey tonight '' from season two you 'll be prepared to understand in episode 5 there be dragons '' jessie slips out of a movie outing with friends to take a walk by herself she wanders around a mall looking at things watching people thinking there 's a wealth of suggestions on what 's going through her mind given the context of events in the episode watch it again after seeing the sex show '' from season three and you 'll find yourself filling in things that could not be suggested on network television in the earlier episode what holds it all together and makes it so compelling is that 'once and again ' is n't afraid to let all the main characters be smart decent people there are no moments of convenient stupidity that are allowed only because suspense must be maintained people sometimes behave questionably or lash out angrily at one another but it 's seldom a surprise because it usually happens under circumstances under which you 'd expect it from the character it 's never a either because not a single main character in the series is the strength of the actors is critical because they are required to render subtle shadings and quick revelations that are necessary to make many scenes work but can not be written into dialog fiction differs from reality in that it has had a narrative imposed on it by a writer thus it is usually better able to illuminate human truths that are missing from an episode of 'fear factor ' or 'who wants to be a millionaire ' when you watch a television series in its original broadcast or under other circumstances in which each episode is new to you you ca n't know the full scope of the narrative that is taking shape in the minds of the writers and they can do only so much to clue you in otherwise it just would n't be cool this is no less true of 'once and again ' after you 've seen every episode going back and watching them over is synergistic you can stand outside the constraints of the moment and understand where it really fits in the arc of the story an omniscient third person would that we could do the same with our own lives the other function of fictional writing is to provide dialog would you want the contestants on 'survivor ' writing the dialog for the movie about your life 'once and again ' is full of zingers both dramatic and comedic especially in the first season judy grace and zoe get most of the funniest lines but the rest of the cast and sometimes even have their share too funny ironic and insightful dialog like this works in several levels and seeing them all springing to life at the same time is the real charm of 'once and again
when once and again first began i dismissed it as a show for just women but after watching just one episode i found myself hooked this was unlike any show i had seen before i actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families once and again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love it goes much deeper than that once and again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well but then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well with the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between lily sela ward and rick billy campbell and how their ex 's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children once and again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today even thought it 's time on television was short once and again showcased the acting talents of sela ward and billy campbell and launched the careers of shane west and evan rachel wood i am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on dvd and that they have finally decided to release seasons 2 and 3
this is one of the finest shows ever to be put on prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons for a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like family matters americas funniest home house are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as sela ward i am beyond thrilled that she is back on tv in house '' the story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking are given mature to excel especially julia rachel ward ward especially is as revelation more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an emmy shows like this are the reason tv was created the 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a year run of the crap on today this is probably the finest ensemble drama since i would give it 10 stars if i coul
i ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself and i was n't disapointed the new print of the searchers '' with all the extras lobby cards reprint of the dell comic and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set in addition you get a two dvd set for stagecoach which started the partnership fort apache she wore a yellow godfaters they were expendable wings of eagles and the long voyage home the only thing i would have chaged is that i would have made almost all the movies in this set westerns the searchers stagecoach fort apache she wore a yellow ribbon rio godfathers the man who shot liberty valance and the quiet man which is n't a western but i think it fits in well would have been my choice for the set that aside i think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of john ford or john wayne will not be disappointed
the john wayne john ford film collection is the finest dvd boxed set i have bought all year it has almost nothing but masterpieces not just great westerns but great like the merchant marine drama the long voyage home 1940 based on a few eugene o'neill plays and the world war two pt boat adventure they were expendable 1945 one of the great war films of all time one watches this set over two weeks and comes away with renewed respect for john wayne as an outstanding actor but also downright awe for john ford as a director not the nicest person but boy could he direct westerns in monument valley and the ireland of the quiet man 1952 which is not included in this set wrong studio the set 's crown jewel is the anniversary remastering of the searchers 1956 which includes not just a shimmering transfer of this dark and tragic masterpiece but also a rare comic book publicity material lobby cards and an audio commentary by peter bogdanovich ethan edwards post civil war loner and indian hater when his niece is kidnapped and killed by comanches may be john wayne 's greatest performance in a sea of great performances in this dvd crown jewels box but a little bit of hank worden 's and ken curtis ' unwelcome comedy relief goes a long way i personally think stagecoach 1939 with wayne 's first important role as the ringo kid is the equal to the searchers it has also been remastered and includes an audio commentary by author scott eyman an american masters '' documentary on both wayne and ford a new documentary on stagecoach as a neglected treasure and a radio production with randolph scott and claire trevor the movie is about nine people traveling by stagecoach through indian territory and features an score by max steiner the same year he did not win for gone with the wind ! the dusty b w fort apache 1948 and brilliant technicolor she wore a yellow ribbon 1949 make up of john ford 's cavalry trilogy with wayne at his peak part three rio grande is not included here because it is a different studio apache has a nasty henry fonda as an commanding officer of fort apache in utah 's monument valley wayne is his likeable subordinate who must carry out orders he personally disagrees with in a role that mirrors the searchers yellow ribbon may be my personal favorite ford monument valley western even more than the searchers it has wayne as a commanding officer about to retire after a lifetime of army service but not until unfriendly nearby indians settle down winton hoch 's magnificent color photography inspired by remington paintings won a oscar also set in ford 's beloved monument valley but not a cavalry drama is the technicolor 3 godfathers 1949 it has wayne pedro armendariz and newcomer harry carey as outlaws out in the desert who come across an abandoned baby at christmas time this story is the third version of a movie done previously in 1929 and 1936 in b w i 've seen all three versions and like ford 's the best it also stars ford regular ward bond as a sheriff out to get the three men but with a wife who wants the baby this is a pleasantly sentimental movie often shown on cable at christmas season and reveals a soft side of a gruff filmmaker the last of eight treasures in this ford and wayne dvd set is the lightweight and color the wings of eagles 1957 it is the true story of commander frank spig '' wead a pioneer aviator in the 1920 's and later screenwriter in the 1930 's and 1940 's one of his finest scripts is for ford 's they were expendable in 1945. eagles also starring dan dailey and maureen o'hara is the sentimental and labor of love story of spig wead 's life over several decades almost all of these film classics come with an original theatrical trailer if you want to see how the movies were originally promoted that especially interests me when masterpieces like the searchers the long voyage home and they were expendable get shut out of the oscar race especially for picture and wayne 's performance but as they say time is the key factor with movies and people still want to see these movie gems long after even best picture oscar winners are forgotten should you buy or rent these from netflicks it is an expensive set in the 75 range but if you buy the set it averages out to only about 8 a picture a ridiculously great buy maybe it can be a christmas present happy viewing !
excellent movies with one that previously was n't available wings of eagles and the best western ever made the searchers they do n't get any better than this the quentesential set
i recommend this dvd set for anyone even halfway interested in john wayne john ford films great editions of eight classic or near classic films at least a couple not available until now a very cool edition of the searchers '' and a remastered set of stagecoach '' all for a little over 50 ! particularly impressive they were expendable '' the ww ii pt boat story good acting from top to bottom great black and white film work and really good stirring special effects in a couple of spots also the three godfathers '' a mystical john wayne western interesting only confusing omission no the quiet man '' also a project i guess you 've always got to leave something off to keep the customer interested and come to think of it rio grande '' was also not included so obviously you ca n't have everything side note typical great service from amazon
we were extremely pleased with all the dvds included in this collection more than we had expected there is also a bonus collection of photos of the cast during shooting of stagecoach that is priceless
the two icons of motion picture may be the best duo ever director and actor now for the collection itself 1 the searchers this is wayne 's best preformance ever by the way he can act and one of may be the best the best western ever wayne can be brutal and then commpassionet the supporting cast is also excellent jeffery hunter natlie wood ward bond and vera miles 2 stagecoach 1939 what a year for motion pictures ford made john wayne a household name by casting wyne in the lead in this film wayne 's introduction in the film is the best ever on screen the camera is out of focus when it draws in on wayne then comes back into focus a mistake but left in by ford outstanding then you have thomas mitchell 's oscar winning preformance and the beautifal clair treavor 3 fort apache the best in the calvary trilogy and the first time on dvd henry fonda as the commander another of john ford 's favorite actors with devistating affects fonda is obsessed with with getting the apache and cochise back on the reservation at any cost wayne is caught in the middle fonda is a george amstrong custard in many ways 4 she wore a yellow ribbon i think that this is one of ford 's best and another great preformance by john wayne an ageing officer trying to avoid more bloodshed in his last few weeks of service this is a masterpiece 5 3 godfathers fugitive bank robbers are chased by a posse and are forced to the desert there they find a dying woman and her newborn they make a promise to the dying women that they ca n't go back on they wo n't abandon the baby great story telling 6 the wings of eagles the true story of cmdr frank spig '' wead an aviation pioneer and writer maureen o'hara and dan dailey real battle footage 7 the long voyage home wayne 's follow up to stagecoach this film was nominated for six academy awards the crewmen on this ship search the sky for german planes while in the north atlantic and hope they survive one of the best american films about life at sea and 8 they were expendable action at it 's best world war 2 at it bleakest hours the defenders of the philippines and john wayne and robert montgomery as commanders try to give the war effort time to regroup after the devastion of pearl harbor story telling at its finest
john wayne is one of my favorite stars and this collection has a number of his best
this dvd set might have garnered 6 stars if only it had included the man who shot liberty valance terrible oversight not to have added it
the searchers is probably my favorite john wayne movies it has many levels of understanding from a simple western adventure to the soul searching and life changing events we all have
this is a must for all those that love john wayne movies a nice selection all in one package

i bought this movie and loved it for the sheer wierdness of seeing three academy award winning actors in a movie about meat grinding humans and drugged runaways sold as sex slaves i noticed if lee does n't have much to say in a scene his upper lip hangs down on his face you can see it for the first time in the killers '' where he intentionally got totally drunk before his dying hitman character kills ron reagan as his career progresses his scenes where his character is n't doing much you can see the hanging upper lip you can also see it the professionals in the opening scenes of this movie where the mob boss is laying down the mission to lee it can be seen again
being from kansas city i 'm always interested in any cinema shot here especially since there are so very few movies made in this part of the country when i learned about the existence of this movie with gene hackman and lee marvin i had to see it i added the dvd to my collection and what can say this movie and it 's implications are almost beyond my comprehension if this is truly how hollywood sees the midwest i am thrilled ! ganster farmers drug controlled sex slaves on the auction block nordic looking henchmen good times between manical brothers and hackman 's mary ann '' character riding high on a wave of murderous lunacy declaring his love of eating guts ! the mind boggles under the weight of this grindhouse style masterpiece that makes blue velvet '' look like the santa clause '' ! in spite of all of this glorious surrealism the only improvement i could possibly suggest would be that it should have been a musical i will swear to my dying day that if this movie would have had some lavish musical numbers no one would have ever even thought twice about the rocky horror picture show '' if lee marvin could have done that dreadful paint your wagon '' movie he could have been up to the task of turning this macabre little film into a that college kids would still be quoting every day this film should be required viewing for anyone even thinking about coming to this part of the country i 'm going to go do my part to live up to this film 's dipiction of kc by putting on my mother 's wedding dress and making sausage out of whatever is n't fast enough to escape my grasp ! vivo el meatpackers
nick devlin lee marvin an enforcer for the chicago mob is sent to kansas city to collect a debt from a rancher and meat packer named mary ann gene hackman mary ann was sent by the mob to run things down there and now claims the fiefdom as his own previous enforcers were dealt with in a way appropriate to mary ann 's chosen industry nick takes his trusted driver and three mob goons with him to collect the money upon their arrival they find mary ann presiding over a livestock auction but the livestock in this auction is the meat packer 's second source of income prostitution nick rescues poppy sissy spacek a drugged out young woman and they leave neither nick or mary ann will give in to the other leaving only one conclusion prime cut '' directed by michael ritchie and made in 1972 is a new film for me recently ebert and roeper featured a number of lee marvin films new to dvd i have never been a fan of marvin but the films looked intriguing so i gave a few a try and also revisited the professionals '' one of my favorite films starring burt lancaster and lee marvin it is important to remember that the film was made in 1972 because it strikes the viewer as dated shortly after nick rescues poppy he buys her a dress she was naked at the livestock auction and they go to dinner at the fancy restaurant in his hotel poppy 's new dress does little to hide her breasts but she seems blissfully unaware as the older men and women in the restaurant stare at her all the time nick and poppy ignore them trying to have a conversation everything about this scene screams early to me from their conversation to the ' look at class later in the film nick and his goons arrange to meet mary ann at the local county fair and collect the money this sequence is introduced with a series of close ups of a man walking on stilts children laughing all meant to disorient the viewer before letting them become familiar with the new setting again very there are many sequences in the film which are strange unusual and interesting ultimately making the film worth watching from the opening sequence mary ann 's demented brother weenie gregory walcott gets rid of one of the mob 's enforcers perhaps the most memorable scene to a harvesting machine chasing nick and poppy through a corn field ritchie seems to be paying homage to hitchcock and it works the action scenes are interesting and hold your attention even the scene set in the corn field which is close enough to be called a rip off of the famous chase from hitchcock 's north by northwest '' ritchie adds a little touch at the end to make it memorable and interesting you wo n't be able to stop watching it when the story turns to more sedate matters and everything relies on the actors the film is less successful marvin seems to have been most comfortable portraying mobsters generals and cowboys throughout his career his demeanor is for these types of roles he merely has to stare at most men and they will surrender this persona works well with this character but when nick is supposed to be human it does n't work when nick takes poppy to dinner it is n't clear if nick is trying to romance poppy or become her supportive uncle '' she clearly seems to be flirting with him but nick does n't seem to return the favor thankfully at this point marvin was 47 wow he looks older but i guess he always did and spacek was 22. not very age appropriate this scene works if poppy is flirting with nick he has just saved her from a life of prostitution and her life has been pretty screwed up to that point but it would be creepy to watch marvin 's nick putting the moves on the younger actress gene hackman is always interesting to watch a villain with the name mary ann is going to have to be fairly menacing hackman follows occasional outbursts with a quick smile or joke trying to hide his true menace this performance reminded me exactly of lex luthor and makes this character seem all the more like a dry run for the villain he would play in the superman '' films beginning in 1978. sissy spacek is good in her first starring role but the part is a very traditional take on the female sidekick so prevalent in action films for a great performance check out her later work in in the bedroom '' prime cut '' is a memorable exercise in action filmmaking two sequences from the film will stay with me for a long time can you figure out which ones
this is a great lee marvin classic with lots of pace script is excellent and lee plays his part as the done wrong gangster to the hilt as good as some of the dirty harry movies rent it before buying to be on the safe side
i was looking for the new release of point blank '' at my local retail dvd buffet and they did n't have it so finding prime cut '' instead which i 'd never seen i bought it kind of as a consolation prize but i was disappointed because i 'd been looking for something with the kooky flashy point blank '' offered grudgingly i popped this in and within the first few minutes of the movie i realized that prime cut '' is definitely weirder than point blank '' somehow i 'd forgotten this was a michael ritchie film made just after downhill racer '' and just before he really swung in with the candidate '' smile '' the bad news bears '' and '' we begin with a graphic tour of a slaughterhouse through which a diced chicago hood is processed into hot dogs by a guy named weenie who would n't look out of place in the back of a panel of sin city '' then there are the barnyard pens of wasted naked sex slaves drooled over by kansas city moneymen presiding over it all is a hairy gene hackman chuckling and shoveling hog guts from a plate into his usual sideways grin lee marvin looking cut from marble marches through the whole thing like he 's the only character who 's already read the script and knows every single decision he needs to make this is a movie that asks us to root against the upstart country boy who defies the mob to favor the mafia enforcer he wades into the sticks to smack the machine so it 'll work right again and we do sure the movie has it 's problems there are of obvious visual metaphors for the way big systems process little things into profitable distortions none of which trump the slaughterhouse credit sequence and the women are mostly helpless have a tendency to get assaulted but bounce right back at the sight of a shopping bag full of clothes the final drags a bit during the sunflower field scene and as for the film 's signature chase scene marvin and sissy spacek flee a gigantic thresher as it chases them across an open wheat field i could n't ignore two thoughts 1 why do n't they just and run around behind the thing which can not easily turn and 2 they could run faster if they were n't holding hands still this is a weird wild underseen gem a colorful thriller almost like an inverted travis mcgee adventure or like a particularly demented don siegel picture you or at least have to love a crime thriller that takes a five minute while the two main badguys play grabass in a kitchen wrestling around like teenaged brothers this was a movie that made me perfectly happy to temporarily miss point blank ''
though short of classic status prime cut '' has alot to recommend it director michael ritchie has a sharp eye for ambience and stages some good action set pieces lee marvin is in classic tough guy form as devlin the bagman sent by the chicago bosses to collect a debt from sleazy mary ann gene hackman whose kansas city meat plant is a front for a more lucrative trade in white slavery and narcotics hackman in what is in essence an extended cameo makes a colorful impression here sissy spacek as a girl entrapped in hackman 's operation is n't really given much to do in her film debut but is easy on the eyes in a kind of way the film breezes by at an economical 86 minutes interesting casting here with gregory walcott plan 9 from outer space '' infamy as hackman 's brother and eddie egan the inspiration for popeye doyle of the french connection '' fame as a chicago mob boss
though 'primary ' introduced the political campaigning doco 'the war room ' surely is the apex of the genre part of the highlight of the doco is stephanopoulos who is captured as he is preening himself and agreeing with others as with the clinton campaign carville steals the show whatever your convictions and mine are on the other side of politics it is impossible not to respect carville for his character and beliefs i dont want to spoil it for you but billary
while i found the glimpses into the inner workings of the 1992 presidential campaign of bill clinton to be interesting and well worth watching it was a bit disappointing campaign manager james carville and communications director george stephanopoulos demonstrate their skills at political maneuvering even though bill clinton was a masterful politician these two men got him elected while both of them show their political fronts they also show their human sides stephanopoulos openly talks about how nervous he is and carville cries when he thanks the staff for their hard work there are two main weaknesses to the presentation the first is that many parts will be incomprehensible to anyone who does not already know a great deal about the events for example there is mention of the relationship between carville and mary matalin but it is never truly explained the incongruity of the political strategists of democrat bill clinton and republican george bush having a romantic relationship in the middle of a presidential campaign is not emphasized as much as it should if you were not aware of the depth of that relationship and who they are then that segment will be little more than a flyby the second main weakness is that your perspective never reaches the level of the fly on the wall '' at all times it is clear that you are seeing into the campaign only to the extent that they want you to see it would have been better if they at least sometimes made it appear that you were seeing workings of the campaign staff that they would have preferred not be seen i was especially disappointed with the response to the gennifer flowers incident clinton and his campaign staff handled it very deftly yet we really do n't see what they did this contrasts with an incident later in the campaign when stephanopoulos fields a call from someone who is threatening to expose what they claim is another clinton infidelity in this case he supposedly fathered a child with a black woman stephanopoulos tells the person politely but firmly that at this point no one cares if you break the story you will never work in the democratic party again i found this video fascinating but i remembered and understood the events that unfolded if you for any reason do not know the fundamentals of what is happening then you will spend a great deal of time puzzled by what you see
what is the war room what we have here is a glimpse of the activities of the clinton for president election team effort during the 1992 presidential race centering around the war room '' the campaign headquarters this documentary begins at the new hampshire primary and ends with clinton 's victory what is it all about we are shown the difficulties the clinton campaign had in dealing with an avalanche of negative press how they essentially continued effectively implementing their strategic election plan while simultaneously minimizing the damage to clinton 's credibility caused by his emerging image as a and an adulterer is simply amazing to see this small epic is quite interesting but knowing how it all ends takes away some of the much deserved suspense and awe sure there are scandals for clinton and we have the accuser admitting that it was the republican party that put her up to it we also have a candidate in clinton that seemed to have no chance to get the support of his party let alone win the election maybe when the film came out 11 years ago it had more weight after all this was all one great big surprise and these were current events however today my attention went to james carville who seemed the most genuine and able participant within the war room we also got a good look at george stephanopoulos whose presence gave a nice contrast to carville i found myself wishing that carville and stephanopoulos had been the candidates as they both seemed more sincere and public service oriented than the actual candidates naturally it does not work that way but that is how the film affected me 5 years after the end of the clinton presidency history as it happened ! this is a true documentary and appears to be fairly objective in depicting how the people who made up the winning political machine in 1992 functioned this team functioned quite well in overcoming seemingly impossible hurdles which we can now witness as they were happening in effect we get to see a rather significant slice of political history as it happened some final thoughts this delightful film is not like jfk '' or some of michael moore 's films in that it is not fictionalized to entertain and convince at the expense of truth charismatic hollywood actors are never used in place of the real people to foster credibility and empathy simply stated the war room '' is closer to reality than many of us are use to seeing in film while it does not have the polish of a jfk '' or the raw emotional impact of a fahrenheit '' the war room '' is much closer to objective truth and therefore extremely worthwhile
the 1992 presidential campaign may seem like eons ago but the war room '' brings it all back the movie focuses on clinton 's aggressive key operatives in particular the blunt unconventional james carville whose lack of social graces is balanced by a searing intelligence and ruthless political instinct and the telegenic george stephanopoulos adding to the drama is the unlikely romance between carville and mary matalin george bush the elder 's chief campaign adviser war room '' is a vivid glimpse into the wheeling and dealing which fuels the modern democratic process
this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning one does not need to love the results of these changes i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election to appreciate how clinton 's 1992 campaign as seen in this film changed the american political world war room '' should be seen along with more recent documentaries like for example staffers '' to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal to be elected rather than to govern hopefully it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless dumbing down assessments of candidate traits like character '' or integrity '' we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years
the war room '' a film by chris hegedus and da pennebaker gives you unfettered access to the strategists of the 92 ' campaign to elect bill clinton and al gore the film does n't have many appearances by president clinton or vice president al gore but that 's not the point the film shows you just how the campaign was won the emotions that were felt and the ups and downs of running this campaign this film gives you an inside look at the truly revolutionary way in which this historic campaign was won the spotlight is on several star strategists of the democratic party such as james carville george stephanopoulos and paul begala all of whom are regulars on cnn 's crossfire the film is similar to many other notable documentaries on political campaigns such as journeys with george but the emphasis is on those in charge the campaign you see into their everyday work lives the reason why this film was so successful in it 's portrayal of campaigning is this had n't been done before the film makers were looked at as friend '' not a foe trying to get a story for the evening news the film makers are party to strategy meetings and every aspect of the campaign as stated in the dvd introduction this film 's historical significance changes everyday as history and current events change it 's and excellent film and if you like political documentaries i suggest you give this a try
this is a must have in your collection sondheim fans ! this box set has titles that appeal to both the children and adults in a family my children love into the woods and the carnegie hall concert especially ! one of the best purchases i 've made this year
i have been in love with the work of stephen sondheim since the age of 6 when i first memorized the lyrics to all of the songs from west side story sondheim has give us many many wonderful pieces of theatre and several of his best pieces are represented here sweeney todd considered by many his masterpiece i prefer the angela lansbury george hearn casting but if they chose to star betty boop and donald duck it could n't hurt this material brilliant follies in concert follies remains my favorite sondheim musical and unlike some other reviewers i thought the original book was brilliant the later revised version considerably weakened both characters and plot and the concert '' version is even more woefully incomplete than the original cast album but thank god they saw fit to include too many mornings '' sunday in the park with george pulitzer prize winning paean to the creative process i can even forgive the casting of mandy patinkin one of my least favorite actors the recreation of seurat 's masterpiece during the first act climax still gives me chills passion the more i watch this achingly beautiful show the more i think it 's one of sondheim 's greatest scores subtle yes but if you allow it to it will grow and grow on you until you ca n't get it out of your mind this show is for anyone who has ever loved someone that they could n't have into the woods i saw both broadway productions and had difficulty choosing which was better i think the original cast represented here had a slight edge possibly the most fun '' of sondheim 's shows this take on grimm 's fairy tales is clever entertaining and highly satisfying the carnegie hall tribute is also wonderful i have long been of the opinion that sondheim can do no wrong his lyrics are thrillingly brilliant witty beyond all expectations and his music contains depth that other broadway composers can only dream of what is most amazing to me is how he can vary styles and musical periods from show to show to show no two of his musicals are ever alike which is more than i can say for many other composers i do n't understand those who like him only to a point i have friends who love sweeny follies and night music but hate sunday passion and into the woods i think he gets better with each succeeding show this set is well worth the investment hurry and get it as some of the individual videos are now unavailable and who knows how long the boxed set will last
sondheim is the master he is the best of the best that said this is a collection of some of his finest work that exists on dvd follies while not the most desireable representation of the show it 's very cut down you still get barbara cook 's stirring losing my mind '' elaine stritch 's dry and perfect broadway baby '' and carol burnett 's i 'm still here '' which is a religeous experience the documentary is quite interesting as well ! passion my favorite sondheim score the music is lush and beautiful the characters are real and fascinating the dialogue is poetry it 's an amazing show with an amazing score and amazing performances given by amazing actors sunday in the park anyone with any interest in art of any form should see this musical it 's a wonderful look at the creation of art and the process of creating it has a strong message of finding something new something of your own '' this is a strong powerful musical about going against the odds for the sake of art and not giving the masses what they want something sondheim does marvelously and brilliantly sweeney todd the greatest musical ever written it 's about murder and cannibalism well the plot at least the show is about revenge and love and obsession and all of this is reflected so beautifully in the amazingly huge score to hear this score played by a symphony orchestra sung by an opera ensemble and with such a fantastic mix of opera and musical theatre stars is heaven george hearn is sweeney todd and patti lupone recreates lovett as her own with brilliant acting and singing neil patrick harris lisa vroman standford olsen also bring magic and beauty to this production celebration at carnegie hall such a loving mix of and obscure sondheim performed by the best too many highlights to name and wonderful new arrangements any sondheim fan should own this and anyone who watches it will soon be a sondheim fan this concert shows why he is considered the greatest musical theatre composer of the century and in my opinion ever

would rate the show as 5 stars this is a review of the extras and features of the special edition issue i recently bought all the special edition releases of stand alone complex '' after trying to research what i was going to get as extras not included in the regular edition i found the listings on amazon 's product details to be a little confusing and incomplete on some of the volumes so i decided to write this guide for others trying to decide i 'm not going to review the ghost in the shell '' episodes or the series in general because there are so many excellent reviews already on this site and most of you probably know about this great anime tv series already there are various other reviews that say that some of the dvd 's and cd 's have errors on them and bandai will replace them with corrected discs if you send them in for exchange i have not ran into problems yet although i have n't gone through the whole series either and i will also state that i love the tv series as well as both movies but i would recommend the imported region 2 version of innocence if you have a region free dvd player dreamworks really messed up that release omiting the english dub and putting hard of hearing subtitles instead of regular ones on the early issues of that movie most people find them very distracting and annoying first off the discs themselves you get two dvd discs in each volume with the same episodes on both discs volumes have 4 episodes each 6 and 7 have 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total in the series both discs are anamorphic wide screen encoded directly from the masters both discs also have english subtitles each set also has two interviews with voice cast or someone associated with the production of the anime and a printed dvd insert pamphlet or booklet with different interviews and such for each volume all discs are region 1. disc one has dolby digital 5.1 in japanese and english and dolby digital 2.0 in english and japanese disc two has dts 5.1 in english and japanese and a dolby digital 2.0 english track volumes 1 and 2 include soundtrack cd 's of the music of yoko kanno the most excellent and versatile composer of the music in the tv series anime lovers know her work from the many fine soundtracks that she 's done for countless other anime movies and tv series volume 3 has a black xl fruit of the loom with the section 9 logo on the front and a major kusanagi graphic on the back nice shirt ! volumes 4 and 5 have a collectable cards for a section 9 member volume 6 has a black xl fruit of the loom with the section 9 logo on the front and a batou graphic on the back and another card nice shirt again ! volume 7 has another ! this time it 's a white xl with the section 9 logo on the front and the laughing man logo on the back ! once again nice shirt ! it also comes with a tin box that 's supposed to hold all 7 volumes of the dvd set i was excited about getting the box but when it arrived i was disappointed with the design it 's kind of like the rectangular lunch box that you used to take to school as a kid without the handle and latch its also of a thinner metal that dents easily it has marketing type of printing on the backside that pertains to vol 7 only and the dvd cases stack inside one on top of the other the spines of the cases are not visible when you open the box only the front of the last case you put in so you have to take all the cases out of the tin to get to a specific volume there 's also not room for the cardboard sleves that the dvd 's were in when you got the individual volumes and no room for the soundtrack cd 's either all said i was disappointed with the box because of it 's odd dimensions it does n't stack in well with my dvd library i would have much preferred the normal five sided box that usually comes with dvd sets overall i 'd say it 's worth it to buy volumes 3 6 and 7 new to get the shirts if they interest you and pick up the others used if you can to save some money on the series that is if you 're interested in the dts soundtrack options i much prefer the dts mixes to dolby digital and wanted the soundtrack cd 's as well also the cardboard boxes that come with volumes 3 and 6 are better than the tin box to store your set in when you complete the series if you stack them on shelves one row of dvd 's on top of another row and you can fit the movies into those boxes as well to fill them the rest of the way
i 'll admit to you that i love to watch adult swim and i 'll also admit that i like certain types of anime no i 'm not one of those nerdy poke'mon lovers i 'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time i like anime that 's made for adults like big o ! cowboy bebop trigun outlaw star tenchi and ghost in the shell i was watching either watching family guy or aqua teen hunger force when i saw previews for this show start to air on adult swim i thought thought it looked cool it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal but i did n't know the half of it what i got was a version of the old film noir mysteries the series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public in the story 'stand alone complex ' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal or in other words an imaginary criminal it also refers to the structure of each episode each episode can be viewed independently of each other and there is little if at all given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date taking place in a fictional city of japan called '' new port city in the year 2030 stand alone complex tells the story of a special operations called public security section 9 or simply section 9 '' the series follows the exploits of section 9 's agents who range from to as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as the laughing man '' public security section 9 is an elite domestic unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of acts of terrorism and crime their duties include response to serious cyber crimes cyberbrain hacking investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases from they also serve as protection to foreign vips if you have seen the movie then you know that the tv series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole the series of 26 tv episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga in comparison to the film version the series is considered by many to be easier to understand also in comparison the series can be found to be closer to the manga due to the presence of some humor the usage of the tachikomas fuchikomas in the manga and referred to simply as tanks '' in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in the design of the characters and also the usage of the characters paz bouma and saito stand alone complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of production in their application of computer generated imagery this is evident in their digital color grading environmental effects and computer models their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene which adds greatly to the atmosphere i think a lot of people will try to compare this to cowboy bebop as with so many other anime and mangas but that 's foolish stand alone complex is no better or worse than cowboy bebop it 's just a different story different style different sets of charactors and there places if you like anime or manga you 'll definitely like this show it 's complex has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it and not to mention the technology ! even if you do n't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is
i 've heard a lot of complaints about the storyline and a lot of complaints about how the dvds are sold and the number of episodes the story is very complex it is there 's no getting around it even the japanese feel that it 's complex and have you had a good look at their written language lately i for one love the series and i 'm a big fan of production ig 's work and masamune 's work especially his more works koukaku kidoutai ghost in the shell and appleseed as for the price of the dvds and the number of episodes i 'm a fan of dvds having fewer episodes or atleast using as much of the disc as possible i compared my japanese dvds with my american ones and found something startling the japanese dvds which have just 2 episodes and cost roughly 60 us utilize more than of the disc the american dvd which has 4 episodes english audio and sells for depending on edition uses a hair over are you being ripped off yes is it because of the number of episodes no a 26 episode series has to be something like or or in this case otherwise the last volume would have a very small number of episodes and that they can not sell personally i wish they 'd just put all the extras on the last disc because then the dts disc would be irrelevant the normal disc could have dts but i 'm willing to bet the average american consumer would still pitch a fit over a dvd with just episodes and a bunch of interviews if you want to feel ripped off do n't do it because of the way the episodes are distributed feel ripped off because they 're putting 4 episodes on the dvd and still fail to use more disc space than the japanese dvds which is a ridiculous thing since once you break the mark whether you use or it still costs the same amount to manufacture so why did n't they fill the disc this while not a 'lack ' of bandwidth still leads to lowered visual quality in comparison to the original japanese dvds oh and if you still want to complain about the price note the fact that the japanese dvds are around 60 and only have 2 episodes kinda puts things in perspective does n't it yes that means that this series is 13 volumes in japan 26 if you count the second season
this is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves the storyline is great but this should have been the last dvd things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over 20 that 's bogus dvds can fit way more episodes on a single disc and it 's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately the cowboy bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start then dropped down to 4. now it 's just getting worse at this point i 'm starting to regret buying the stand alone complex series instead of renting it i am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out though throughout the series i think disc 4 was my favorite
with this dvd stand alone complex returns completely to the story arc at its core the laughing man with togusa out of commission the rest of section 9 focuses on finding the real culprits behind the attack on the sunflower society the ministry of health all three of the episodes here chip away at the truth but we will find little satisfaction in knowing the names no sooner is a witness discovered but he is killed and the trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of government this is the classic paranoid plot more than one player makes the mistake of believing that there is some honor among thieves and faces elimination the ministry of health is ruthless and heavily armed as major kusanagi discovers assassins lurk everywhere and even aramaki falls afoul of a plot gradually the entire ugly story of the intentional suppression of a treatment for cyberbrain sclerosis for a technology that is ineffective but makes a fortune for the politicians behind the scenes this is a dark story without the actions of the laughing man no one would know that hundreds are due to die in agony to line the pockets of a political movement that will stop at nothing to increase its power with no evidence section 9 seems condemned to making desperate attempts to find a witness who will stay alive long enough to testify and without that witness their hands are tied unlike the earlier laughing man episodes the story has remained coherent from the moment that togusa finds the paper report despite an intricate plot the level of action stays high and there are a few real surprises for the viewer it 's not just the enemy who can be sneaky with three more episodes to go there 's a lot of room for even more plot twists
i 've been wondering how a series could be completed with installments now in retrospect it all seems sadly obvious just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs and charge the same price ! sound of metallic breathing do not underestimate the power of the dark side ! ! ! on the positive side i guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the complex '' variety and thus considerably advance the laughing man storyline do n't get me wrong this is a great chapter of stand alone complex highlighted by a scene in which the laughing man pulls someone 's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire if there 's a weak part of this installment it 's the sequence with the armored suit '' which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first gits film just as the testation '' episode had done several installments back the armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect by the end of this installment almost the entire shape and design of the laughing man plot seems clear it is interesting to learn from the special features that the murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be material
hey does anyone know how i can get the original version of this movie that starts out with a long view of the sub barracks gives a glimpse of baldwin meeting connery at an embassy party in dc builds up the radiation badge issue and so on i must have seen this movie before they trimmed it down for broad issue directors cut '' does not appear to have this any ideas as we all know it 's a great movie no matter what edition we view
this is one of my all time favorites in the acton adventure category it really is a must see about submarines it is just really a stimulating movie it is so much better than a bond movie and i love bond
this is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations this film 's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them sean connery plays captain marko ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film tim curry is amusing as the dutiful petrov in a role well suited for him the rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of sean connery and tim curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film alec baldwin as jack ryan james earl jones as admiral james greer sam neill as captain vasily borodin scott glenn as commander bart mancuso richard jordan as jeffrey pelt and an impressive peter firth as political officer ivan putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story this was probably one of alec baldwin 's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of jack ryan should have been portrayed baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of jack ryan embodied sam neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country 's political dictates and ambitions sam neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly i liked scott glenn 's character immensely as the us commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him the list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film their efforts make this film a great political and emotional drama
one of the last great films of the cold war era made around the time the berlin wall fell the hunt for red october is classic intrigue and tension of the ussr and usa over dominion of geopolitics sean connery brings back the cool and intense demeanor that made him famous as the original james bond
central intelligence agency '' captain bart mancuso growls descending a ladder in his sub now there 's a contradiction in terms '' he is about to match wits with a wily russian sub commander played stoically and well by sean connery who is trying to surrender his ship to the americans a ship with only one purpose '' the red october is the pride of the soviet fleet its newest and biggest and with the newest toy a caterpillar drive equipped to travel through the water nearly silently and almost impossible to detect connery 's captain ramius i was almost ready to believe that lithuanians is supposed to be lithuanian speak russian with a scots accent has had enough cold war in his life and wants to make sure he can level the playing field as he leaves or die trying enter into the mix jack ryan a young analyst for the cia and a student of russian sub commanders ramius in particular i was always sorry alec baldwin did not reprise his role in the next jack ryan vehicle i thought he brought a sense of urgency and brilliance to the role that harrison ford do n't get me wrong i think he 's good too and i always thought ford was too old for the part anyway baldwin had just the right touch for the first movie the camaraderie and mutual respect between his character and james earl jones ' admiral greer is obvious they know each other well and trust each other 's judgment recruited by greer to convince a boardroom of military advisors on the sudden and mysterious naval activity in the north sea which is known to center around the new sub red october ryan succeeds in selling the president 's main advisor on what he thinks is going on he 's correctly surmised that ramius wants to defect trusting that ramius has already figured out the worst parts and has a plan worked out the advisor pelt delegates ryan to go out and intercept the sub before the russian fleet chasing him gets close enough to eliminate him there are excellent supporting roles scott glenn as capt mancuso spent time aboard an actual working naval sub to get the authenticity of his part and he is superb until i watched the extras on the dvd i was unaware that larry ferguson who plays chief watson on mancuso 's sub had a lot to do with writing the screenplay i liked him before that but knowing that added another dimension it does n't get any better than the aforementioned james earl jones and also good in smaller roles are courtney vance sam neill and the lesser russian officers that make up ramius 's elite cadre of expatriots in contrast to what 's been going on the last few years the cold war seems almost genteel in its menace i could almost look back on it with nostalgia almost this movie reminds us that things are never going to be easy or without cost no matter what method of persuasion is employed i can not recommend this movie highly enough i know parts of it by heart
even though this movie has some miles '' on it it never seems to be dated '' story is still full of suspense and even though we have seen it several never grows old we live in a small fifth and this is one of the movies we both voted to take with us for those rainy days ! a '' for anyone who loves movies
what a superb action flick it has an cast all male and many who became stars later sean connery is captain ramius of the new super sub red october '' his stature is legendary among all soviet submarine captains but his is lithuanian and his wife has died a year earlier while he was at sea he has no children the officer crew of the sub was hand picked by him and are almost all men who are personally loyal to him jack ryan here is played by alec baldwin in one of his best roles he is a brilliant cia analyst rather than a field officer and knows submarines because of what develops he is brought in by cia chief admiral greer the immortal and national treasure james earl jones to advise the national security advisor pelt the wonderful and too soon lost richard jordan there is a great deal of confusion between what the americans the soviets and the various crews of various ships know we the audience know the actual situation but we are concerned about who will learn what before or after it is too late what i like most about this movie is that while there are some heroics they are n't the superman kind of stunts that show up in too many action flicks people try to do what they have to do and it does n't always work out without a cost or even all that well in the end well you already know or should watch the movie to find out i do want to single out the terrific courtney vance as the sonar genius jones scott glenn as commander mancuso of the us sub dallas and sam neill as the soviet captain borodin to ramius fine performances from each even though the ships are big shooting a movie in such confined quarters risks tedium and claustrophobia which can work for a film if handled well this film focuses in on faces and shows us people talking in small groups so we can see the emotion on their faces as they struggle to understand what is going on and what should happen next enjoy
the dvd is a great movie it was packed good and got to me in a short time
this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub 's this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was alec baldwin i would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers
ah a classic just one of those movies that will never ever go out of style sean connery and alec baldwin make a perfect team in this well done adaptation of the novel expertly cast and with very good cinematic effects its just an all around great movie
the thing i remember most about this film when i saw it in the theater in 1990 was its honesty on every level great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time when aids was first being diagnosed as the gay cancer '' up through the when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends though had been around for a decade when this movie was made there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past they not only show the ugliness of the disease they show the ugliness of people 's response to it even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs there was fear of contamination reluctance to touch or kiss and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered people reached deperately for new age cures and louise haye was the reigning goddess of by choosing to depict a period the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen some of course succumb to the disease and die others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives in the end the survivors try to become part of the solution they become visiting volunteers and political activists for all its authenticity the film is not depressing this is incredible ensemble acting at its best campbell scott bruce davison and mark lamos give especially moving performances but there are no slackers in this cast by the time the movie was released the face of aids was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims i felt then and i continue to believe this is a misplaced criticism all fiction is longtime companion is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them yes they were wealthy or white men who spent summers together on fire island but longtime companion is not a celebration of their insular lives in fact by the end of the film one of this insular group campbell scott 's character is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a latino man i think the filmmakers like gmhc at the time were aware that things were starting to change it seems to me that the film 's critics even in 1990 had forgotten that aids was first announced in the new york times as gay cancer '' and later as gay related immune deficiency syndrome '' before being called aids but that said we need to remember that there are many other people 's stories that are worth telling including those of people living and coping with aids in africa my only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of longtime companion the dvd has no significant extras '' but the transfer is excellent
there are a great many gay themed films available today but when longtime companion was released it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes something that continues to beset filmmakers even today set during the late 70 's and on into the 80 's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful portrait of the devastating effects of the aids virus on a small group of close and on the wider gay community very funny extremely moving occasionally upsetting whether you are a gay viewer or not this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit
this was a wonderful movie about a group of very good friends the acting is realistic for the movies sake it will definately pull at your heartstrings also full of the comapassion one hopes for in their end i was a caregiver so this was an important view highly recommended ! ! ! !
this drama is filled with possitive messages but has a darkness to it that will make you angry in a productive way
this moview will make you laugh and cry it show that love and care that a group can give
this film is a wonder for many reasons beautiful performances sharp writing and directing and sad when i first saw this the sobbing in the theater was so intense that i thought i 'd have to build an ark to get home now longtime companion is still all of those things but a little dated advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where aids is not an immediate death sentence watching this film years later it does play a bit like and then there were none '' but it still works watch it and remember if you lived through that era watch it and be greatful if you did not
i saw the broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the dvd i think that everyone should see this movie over and over again chris columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping jonathan larson 's ideals and view and dreams alive the actors are first rate ! they each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable i am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the dvd i wish that chris had kept goodbye love '' in the film but thank god we have a chance to see it it is a scene that has to be seen by all ! the documentary on the disc 2 is something i am privleged to have watched and i 'm so happy to now know how jonathan larson lived his life no day but today ! !
not following the recent broadway scene very much i was n't really aware of what a sensation rent '' was several years ago when it debuted i became more aware of it when it was satirized in the southpark picture team america '' and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show 's theme '' song seasons of love '' then one of the kids that i worked with in a local musical said rent was one of his favorites so i was a attendee at the theatre the story is important as it depicts gays lesbians drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life love and aids just like normal '' people being in the rock style the songs are n't necessarily '' that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre though seasons of love '' comes close particularly if you 've sang it at least two dozen times and la vie boheme '' is a showstopper the plot is supposedly based on the opera of that name but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story the cast moved almost en masse from broadway to hollywood wilson heredia a tony winner as drag queen angel should have contended for an oscar as supporting actor i 've read that there was some concern about mainstream hollywood director chris columbus home alone harry potter i and ii getting the job but i do n't see that the picture suffered for it maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it as a rock opera it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken overall another solid four star film definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals to those in marginalized communities and to those with art in their souls afterwards i got hooked on the soundtrack cd for a few weeks months but that 's another review
i borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it i was n't quite sure how i would feel about it after watching it i have to say that i love this movie and bought it the next day regardless of what critics have written i loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made rent a success yes they are supposed to be in their 20 's in the play but really i barely noticed or frankly could 've cared less i love jesse martin and he was fantastic idina menzel 's voice is super and was ever surprised that rosario dawson could sing anthony rapp adam pascal wilson jermaine heredia and tracie thoms were great as well yes they changed and omitted things that are in the broadway play but if you are truelly a fan of rent you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present the wonderful songs !
i absolutely love this film it is one of the best ever i have been dying to see it on broadway but have n't been able to it 's so hard to anyways with broadway being so expensive but the film is amazing the original cast of the broadway show save for two are in this film and it 's great i love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really and i mean really know how these characters are it 's a great film it brings a new light to those that have n't heard of the show before and it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture aids lesbians gays druggies and it 's just a great film i related to mark the most because of how he loves to film things i think that there is a rent '' character for everyone ! i give the movie a 10 out of 10 ! ! !
i have to say i was a little weary when i decided to see this movie alot of my friends raved about it but im so picky i didnt think id like it so i watched it and i was blown away i cried the first few times i saw it i must 've watched it about times and i can never get enough it is beautifully done the music is excellent the casting was clear perfection i give props to the writer of the original play what a masterpiece i could rave forever and ever about it the storyline is such like todays life paying rent sucks and its nearly impossible to get good money around here i could rant and rave for hours all i have to say is if you havnt seen it it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15 the topics can get a little mature but it really is worth it
i am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film i never saw the broadway musical on which the movie was based so i do n't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie i have to say that the film really touched me and i generally have n't liked most of the recent musical films that i 've seen all of the songs in rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there 's hardly any spoken dialogue this means that rent moves forward on the strength of its songs each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character playwright jonathan larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for at the time he wrote it back in the early 90 's being so out there '' and taking the risk of writing about aids and homosexuality and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people if you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals nobody would believe you but that is exactly what happened it is also a shame that the actual reality of life in alphabet city now very much gentrified and the nature of the aids crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film 's greatness because they will regard it as out of date i guess i just found the movie to be brilliant because it was n't supposed to be absolutely realistic it was supposed to evoke emotion and that it did at least for me none of the individual relationships get that much screen time yet i really cared deeply about all of these characters both as a group and individually you could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had aids the urgency to create the urgency to love since in 1990 there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented hiv from turning into full blown aids as there are today also if you are not moved by collins ' tribute to angel in the reprise performance of i 'll cover you '' all i can say is that you have no soul jesse martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss grief and love that is the best performance in the entire movie rent is one of those few films that i like to watch over and over just to see if i have missed anything it does seem like some of the movie 's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that chris columbus who is well known for directing family films directed this movie unfortunately bob fosse is no longer with us because i have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material
great music makes you want to get up and dance or sing or both filming in a new york winter helps to really bring you into their angst i loved it
to me the office is one of those shows that people either love or hate this past summer i became familiar with the show by catching the reruns of the season on nbc after watching just one full episode i was hooked i continued to tune in each week to watch the reruns and ended up buying season 1 a few weeks later i watched that dvd repeatedly and decided that i had to buy the season as soon as it was available on dvd i 've watched both seasons a countless number of times the episodes never stop being funny no matter how many times you watch them at least that 's how it is in my case i know most of the people who will read this review will have probably already seen the show and might be as big of a fan of it as i am but i can not express enough what an amazing show this is the writing and the comedic timing are beyond words i hope to see this show last for at least 5 seasons standout episodes from season 2 in my opinion the dundies the client christmas party the injury the secret michael 's birthday drug testing casino night that was really hard to choose because all of the episodes are amazing
this is one of the best purchases i 've ever made a great dvd to have in your collection priceless episodes a great cast you ca n't go wrong in buying this dvd
if you 've liked even one of the office '' tv episodes you 'll want to be enjoying this cd thus avoiding those disruptive commercials carried along by the excellent acting skills of the entire cast you 'll experience the pains and the passions of these familiar personality types this is reality tv '' that 's more real than reality itself
i knew i loved the office before i bought season two but i did n't realize just how much i 've watched every episode so many times and i 'm not even close to being sick of them the commentaries are so brilliant and involve so many of the actors and writers and producers and others from the creative team of this show i 've learned so much about the show in general as well as the specific writing decisions they 've made and the actors ' choices and thoughts on how certain scenes turned out the extras like the bloopers and the psas are so wonderful as well this is one of the best purchases i 've made in a while
this is hands down the best comedy on tv right now the office uses intelligent humor an excellent mix of characters to bring about some extremely funny situations and stories set in a small town and a paper company the manager is clueless when it comes to business but very charasmatic and lovable his ignorance creates somve very memorable situations i recommend this item for anyone who like humor that does not involve children hitting each other with trash cans
great dvd purchase the extras are hysterical especially the fake more you know '' public service announcements
this dvd set is great a must have for any office fan the special features are really worth it
this dvd set of the second season was wonderful ! it contains the complete shows plus deleted scenes from each episode it also features commentaries on select shows where the episode plays out and the actors and writers talk about what was going on in the moment etc this is in the bonus features which also includes bloopers and fake 's and other gems i highly recommend this if you are an office fan and if you are n't get on board for cryin ' out loud ! it 's an awesome show ! !
an absolutely amazing collection of scrantonistic comedy ! if you like the show you 'll love this collection of episodes bonus clips and deleted scenes enjoy
robert downey plays a smooth talikng problem solver who tries to pick up a teacher who is also a really good luck charm when it comes to playing casinos whose father is in enormous debt who is being bailed out by robert while still trying to pick up molly while being pursued by a scary hitman harvey keitel while being funny the whole time it 's a good movie people buy it own it love it enjoy
this is a great film probably underrated by professional '' reviewers it 's full of energy enthusiasm and fun
this movie is a romantic tale of a young man who wants to be the best salsa dancer the world pretty much it 's kind of cheesy and corny but the dancing in the film is superb the main character is a buff good looking guy with a jerry curl i guess that was cool during the time the movie was made ! he is overprotective of his sister blah blah she goes out with his friend and he is against it but realizes that he is being stupid and goes on to become a great dancer good watch for those of you into movies such as dirty dancing and llambada
i first watched this movie when i was 7 years old with my mom here in croatia never have i imagined i would be able to buy it and watch it so many years after especially since i have been dancing my whole life and salsa for the last 2 years the words can not express how i felt watching this movie and reliving the passion i feel every time i step on the dance floor yes it 's an 80 's movie and yes the acting could have been better but that was how the music and salsa were interpreted back then i if it was any different it would be disappointing the lovestory is nicely incorporated in the movie which is full of strong bold salsa moves robby rosa is absolutely fantastic and was the best choice for this role the appearance of celia cruz the queen of salsa and tito puente shows that the makers of the movie wanted to show salsa in all its variety from classical celia cruz to hip and modern chicos y chicas because salsa can be danced to any music it comes from the heart and this movie shows it in the best possible way
i love this movie ! ! i remember the first time i saw it i was about on a plane on my way to puerto rico eighteen or so years later i bought it watched it with my family it brought back so many great memories we loved it all over again i love the music the dancing the the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is an 80 's movie ! we all know how 80 's dance movies have the bad fame of neing corny ! i have to admit it did have some corny and bad acting moments but all in all i think this is an amewome movie i love it recommend it
i lvoed this movie i have been looking for it for years the story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great it just wants to make you get up and dance
of course i enjoy this movie i ordered it after so many years of searching for it i love salsa music and the
salsa is a brilliant movie one of the best movies with no major plot there is fantastic music and great dancing and a hot guy what more could you want rico robby rosa and menudo wants to win a dance competition that will take him to puerto rico he 's also the older and over protective brother to rita and when she starts dating his best friend ken he goes nuts when he finds out they keep their relationship secret for a while will this ruin his chance of winning the dance comp as i said earlier there is fantastic music in this movie margarita and under my skin are the best the actual scene when they play margarita is fantastic it 's a now dated movie but it is still a favourite of mine that i do watch over and over again still i love it and any fan of dance movies should love it to especially if you like that latin flavour
i just can not keep my hands off this awsome movie i recomend it to anyone any age any time it is the type of movie that you just have to get to understand the total greatness of ! the best advice you 'll ever get ! ! !
julia child still is the best ! the dvd 's contain many many of the secrets to french cooking that only can otherwise be found by purchasing many books and watching hours and hours of the food channel the examples and visual images are excellent
just great a real classic and still so relevant today
i purchased both dvd 's of the french chef both are equally enjoyable and bring back a different time when we did n't have food celebraties '' but just julia still informative and interesting along with the combination of her irreverance and humor make these dvd 's a must have whether the viewer enjoys cooking or not
with many of the early episodes recipes included this dvd is a delight watching julia 's aplomb as things go wrong is reassuring to anyone who has had a kitchen disaster though i doubt that i 'll cook the tripe some of the other recipes look worth tackling
i knew i would love learning from julia 's shows and see lots of techniques but i had no idea how hilarious these shows are julia has a dry humor and a delightful way of handling mishaps but the burned french onion soup and the tart that flipped out of the pan and onto the counter were the best ! ! no one on the food network would let you see how to do this part of cooking i 'm too young to have seen the shows first hand so there are all new to me julia said in an interview once that she always considered herself a cooking teacher and she is the dish being prepared is just the vehicle to teach about everything from how to shop for food to how important it is to keep your area clean and tidy and did you know that apples must be stirred with a purple spoon '' everything that i make from these dvds is great and has become a kitchen regular i recommend them for entertainment education and a good laugh
these dvds are pure and uninterrupted julia no awkward introductions or montages just jc however the episodes are jumbled and skip from the first episodes to later ones in the seventies no dates ! so the only way to divine their sequence is by her clothing and hairstyle honestly would n't it have been more effective to showcase her progression as a tv personality by revealing her episodes to us just as the public saw them
like others i remember the fascination with watching julia child on public television as a kid in the 70 's and even beyond i think it was on cable sometime within the last decade recently i felt compelled to purchase this i own the book in julia child 's kitchen '' which most of the recipes for the color tv shows are found and i had fond memories i was not disappointed ! in fact i plan to purchase volume 2. i love the way the discs are divided into appetizers main courses and desserts so much information here each show is a full 30 minutes i love how julia throws other information in along the way such as the french onion soup show where she goes into detail about sharpening and caring for knives such a warm and wonderful personality she is always humourous never condescending it is funny to watch things not quite '' turn out as planned and she goes with it it is a joy to watch ! my only disappointment is that there 's not a volume 3 '' there are so many of these shows available i hope wgbh in boston will release them in time one that i really wish they would release on dvd is the chicken breast show which featured chicken kiev i remember this one especially yes these shows are years old and some of the foods are not quite what i would serve today tripe anyone but regardless there is a wealth of information in addition to the entertainment value highly recommended
these french chef ' dvds give us 18 episodes of this landmark julia child pbs series organized by course rather than by chronology among the first disc 's side dishes are early black and white episodes mixed in with later color episodes these confirm what we have read in julia child 's biography that the early shows were herculean feats of improvisation in front of a live tv camera in an improvised boston wgbh studio where there was no opportunity to edit out mistakes these episodes show how child really set the standard for the tv cooking show and invented almost all the conventions we see nowadays from the likes of paula deen giada delaurentiis and emeril lagasse in his of emeril ' shows it also shows where show creators such as alton brown and rachael ray have created great shows primarily by breaking out of julia child 's prototype while the contemporary tv culinarians still follow julia 's lead it is amazing to see how so many of julia 's shows still do a better job with their subject for starters you get the full 30 minutes of material per episode you do n't get 22 minutes of material with three interruptions for commercials and promotions you also get complete shows on a single dish albeit relatively complicated dishes like the classic nicoise ' after four years of watching the food network virtually on a daily basis i recall no show even from the more classicly oriented hosts such as martha stewart or ina garten dealing with a complete composed salad the nicoise ' is composed of at least three major and two or three minor tasks making the potato salad alone takes practically half the show and actually seeing how miss julia composes the final presentation is easily worth anything from ina or martha in contrast the modern 22 minute culinary shows are often used to demonstrate three or even four different dishes which leaves very little room for expounding on less common techniques if nothing else the art of the swapout has been mastered to the point where one may be surprised to see any real cookng at all this is one reason why i respect rachael ray 's demonstrations as she is clearly always working in real time one possible negative aspect of this show is seen on some episodes where miss julia gives us the traditional french method which has really been discarded by almost all modern chefs one example which comes to mind is on her demonstration of trussing a roasting chicken every modern american writer i have seen including even james beard from 30 years ago does not bother trussing a chicken in any way they simply tuck the wing tips under the body and may suggest tenting the breast with aluminum foil or draping it with bacon so it does not become too well done while the slower cooking dark meat finishes even this show however has its virtues as when julia shows us how to detect when a bird has gone past its prime by checking the bone on the tip of the breast if it is fully bony the bird is probably well over a year old if it is still soft the bird is still between 9 and 12 months old i was also pleased to see on this episode exactly how the wishbone is extracted and was reassured to see that even so expert a cook as julia child had some difficulty in doing it neatly in short julia child had no inhibitions against doing messy kitchen tasks if you are a food network junkie or just a foodie you ca n't go wrong by acquiring these disks
the french chef child forever be a national treasure thankfully technology has made it possible for child to teach for generations to come
alright i admit it i am a chef wannabe so my reviews of cooking and baking books dvds etc are slanted but you will have to admit that before there was paul jacque martha mario michael giada bobby and all the other greats there was and always will be the one and only julia no one greater this first dvd from her groundbreaking cooking series is a pure joy when this series first came out in the 60 's i was a little kid it was on saturdays on our local pbs station i would stop anything i was doing and plop myself in front of the tv and wait for this tall somewhat accented unusual lady to teach me another secret of french cooking i was hooked from the moment that i saw her first show she is the queen this show was the beginning of what would slowly evolve into an incredible food industry eventually making tv cooking and baking a huge market and starting the careers of many a chef this is a set it comes encased within a jacket that shows many photographs of how the show was really made with set people put into uncomfortable positions in order to invisibly help child in making her show the success that it was the first disc is entitled starters and side dishes '' 1. the potato show 2. your own french onion soup 3. bouillabaisse a la marseillaise 4. the spinach twins 5. salade nicoise 6. french fries the second disc is entitled main courses '' 1. beef bourguignon 2. to roast a chicken 3. the lobster show 4. to stuff a sausage 5. tripes a la mode 6. the whole fish story the third disc is entitled baking desserts and other classics '' 1. queen of sheba cake 2. cheese and wine party 3. apple dessert 4. mousse au chocolat 5. the good loaf 6. the omelette show she makes cooking and baking a class in which she does not act as if she is perfect things happen and perhaps it wo n't go as smoothly as it should but if it can happen to her then you know it is ok to have mishaps occur for you she made you comfortable in learning and appreciating a different cuisine her point was that she loved french cooking and she wanted to share that knowledge with you julia was quite an interesting woman who had a rather interesting and privileged upbringing suffice it to say that early in her life she did not even know how to boil water much less attempt french cooking but the love of a man named paul child changed everything and that love evolved her life into the woman we came to know and admire if you are interested in her biography i suggest appetite for life the biography of julia child '' by noel riley fitch she was such a gracious woman but all who have known her have said that she was an everyday person who took no pains in letting you know that she was as comfortable in simple surroundings as in fancy ones you feel that in her manner of talking in this or any of her series she was the grand dame '' of the culinary world and we were blessed by her style and presence
dysfunctional and down right humorous describes confessions of an american girl '' jena malone dangerous lives of altar boys stepmom shines in this film just like she always does two things that will always go together are jena malone an comedy but i 'll have to admit some of the best acting in this film was that of brad renfro the client he plays a 'closet ' homosexual and the obvious reason he hides it is because of his tough as nails '' prison father a lot of the characters in this film are like a lot of people you know see in real life and thought most label them as poor white trash you discover in coag '' that they have passionate souls too also on another collins was one of the best things in this film and one of the funniest too so buy it rent what you must it 's great
the story is interesting and the characterare querky malone is great i really enjoyed this different movie something that hollywood couldnt and wouldnt put out
highly recommended as an example of how to stage and sequence a complex scene if you like black comedy you should enjoy confessions of an american girl '' rena jena malone is the embodiment of that old cartoon where the guy is sitting on the ground with a noose around his neck and a broken rope in his hand captioned some people ca n't do anything right '' rena lives in a mobile home with her somewhat strange '' family is suicide challenged is pregnant by a guy who does n't want to be seen in public with her and blames it all on the unfair eight year absence of her loving father who is in prison for murder her dim idealic memories of her father are somewhat biased the highway and its exit ramps are metaphors for her life and her desire to end her life the film is not quite as good as ghost world '' but has much the same tone and feel alicia witt plays rena 's because malone and witt are arguably the most intelligent actresses in hollywood you immediately wonder about the wisdom of casting them as moronic trailer trash but malone has a special talent for playing this kind of '' character and witt 's standard sarcastic teen character works fine even in this environment their scenes together are the best ones in the film with their reconciliation scene toward the end especially good brad renfro does a good job as rena brother jones remember the waitress in seinfeld 's bubble boy '' episode is excellent in a small role and clifton collins is great as buddy the prison trustee who quickly sizes up the situation and sets the forces of change in motion while american girl '' is an above average film its main scene the picnic at the prison which actually takes up the majority of the film pushes it into cinema classic territory this scene is an example of the way storytelling should be done and the pacing is absolutely inspired it is staged perfectly as buddy orchestrates a sequence of revelations that changes all four visiting family members even if you hate the subject of this film it is worth watching just to see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene the disasterous visit over the family leaves the prison with the statement it went better than it could have '' then again what do i know i 'm only a child
at first this movie seemed trite but less than halfway into it it became something much more an honest look at a dysfunctional and insecure girl her older and just downright mean half sister her brother john who is the calmest and simplest character with a dark secret in the movie her hardworking single mother played superbly by michelle forbes and her over the top father sent away to prison for two consecutive life terms for murder jena malone 's character dreams of seeing her father knowing him and making him proud right at the time that she realizes she is pregnant in one day at the annual prison picnic do these things actually exist how scary ! ! the family reunites reluctantly except rena malone what follows therafter are numerous amounts of surprises and several laugh out loud moments while some of this movie may be funny this is certainly a more serious film that deals with coming of age the longing that comes with having an absent father in a young persons life suicide depression and coming to terms with one 's reality and not just the dream they want i was amazed at how good this movie actually was the acting by all cast members is really great and the story is not boring however shocking or disturbing it may be it is simply real possibly someone else 's reality which makes it all the more interesting
this movie showcases jena malone 's talent immensly it has it 's sad and poignant moments but overall it has a lot of heart and believe it or not you may relate to some of the emotions expressed in this film recommended for jena malone fans and dark comedy lovers everywhere
i 'm no big fan of gay or lesbian films i only bought this dvd bcuz i 'm a huge lili taylor admirer so i was n't expecting very much from it but while watching this movie i could n't believe my eyes how great and touching this story was i especially liked the scene with lili and courtney sitting in park and yearning to touch each other but they could n't do it and instead they touched themselves in their minds another great drama point was courtneys and lilis alienation because of lilis high devotion to her studies i highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves great drama you wo n't be disappointed
not your usual depressing cheesy production value type lezbo vehicle that we 're used to seeing thank god for that pluses courtney is great the characterization well thought out the story is absorbing well acted but in the end its just another disappointment ends left dangling and unresolved not quite up to the hollywood standard minus a downer overall a little bit homophobic at times as the womyn in it suffer from their own inner etc still it 's better than most
as a guy when i see the word lesbian '' on a dvd cover i spring for it usually in my experience it 's a pretty stupid movie julie johnson '' is done in a more mature and sophisticated way than the other ones i 've seen but there 's still a lot missing here julie johnson is played by lili taylor who has lost her looks quite a bit since i saw her in john waters ' pecker '' julie is a typical housewife she 's a one of her children is mischa barton formerly of the with no high school diploma and a mean husband noah emmerich who frequently downsizes her when she decides she 's going to get her ged and possibly go to college her husband finally pushes her too far and she kicks him out of the house her friend claire courtney love in a marvelously subdued performance is inspired by julie 's decision and leaves her husband julie allows claire to stay with her and the kids and eventually admits to claire that she has sexual feelings for her claire is mad at first but eventually admits to the same feelings pretty soon the neighborhood catches on and the couple become outcasts the film eventually ends abruptly almost as if one of the lead actors died before they could finish filming the movie is pretty cliched you can see what decision the character is going to make about five minutes before they actually do taylor plays the role very realistically and love delivers one of her best performances this did n't affect my enjoyment or lack of the film but i 'm merely saying this as a warning to other viewers this film contains absolutely no nudity the movie has a kind of organic feel to it and the cinematography is it 's better than a film like better than chocolate '' but if you never see this film in your lifetime it 's not going to affect anything grade b
julie johnson is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a new jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship longing for knowledge to change things she considers herself stupid sneaks science magazines to read when her overbearing husband is n't around and finally gathers the courage while staring at the stars one night to change her plight she takes a computer course passes her ged and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life along the way she discovers other secrets about herself buried in the facade of a life she has led she changes relates to the world in a different way and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life ' when her husband returns promising her change her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels but in the end this friendship can not last as her girlfriend does n't have the same goals the story is simple but in the hands of the writers wendy hammond and bob gosse and with gosse 's fine direction the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe lili taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend courtney love gives a bravura performance the remainder of the cast spalding gray noah emmerich gideon jacobs mischa barton et al is likewise strong but it is taylor 's film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career a thoughtful sensitive engrossing film grady harp september 0
i really enjoyed this movie for a variety of reasons it was entertaining and fun and the subject matter was also interesting to me since i love both personal growth and intellectual learning the plot of julie johnson '' centers around two women who leave difficult marriages move in together develop romantic feelings for each other and around the effects of their decisions upon each other their friends and their children julie returns to school and discovers many things about herself that she missed out on since she had not ever graduated from high school and had always thought of herself as stupid an opinion reinforced regularly by her brutish husband i was unsure if i would enjoy this movie as i do not necessarily enjoy lesbian love stories finding them generally caught up in the message of the acceptance of homosexuality more than a great plot acting directing etc this movie is not like that it is more about the awakening of a woman 's potential at it is about how when we grow personally we can leave people behind even people we dearly love it is about the lines drawn between friendship and romantic love do we draw them and when it is about how we decide to call the end to a romantic relationship when we are adults and change dramatically discovering something new about ourselves that revolutionizes our lives how does this affect those around us in this movie for the main character julie it was not lesbianism that she discovered that mainly transformed her life but a love for learning when you are an adult and a learner how do you cope in our society which oftentimes tells you that this is weird '' behavior this last question is my favorite of all and i related to this movie a lot as often people who love to learn study and discuss ideas like me find themselves the targets of prejudice as being dull boring and no fun '' all of these questions are explored in this story of two lower homemakers and the challenges they face the lesbian lovemaking scenes are not explicit they are in good taste and they made sense within the context of the movie the actors in this movie are fabulous taylor courtney love and the actors playing the children as well i did not think the movie was at all the husbands were stereotyped and seemed in many ways like neanderthals but there were also men portrayed in positive ways such as julie 's major professor this is not an film lovely quality unforgettable film
wow what an excellent film ! great acting directing and story sort of rainman meets hoboken housewife meets lesbian love affair '' i must admit i was very leery of watching this fearing it was going to be a lesbian love story i must admit i am not a fan of the bit i loved queer as folk i watched this because i had a copy of the movie having done a dvd release party at the club i work at otherwise it would have been very unlikely that i would have ever watched it that said i am very glad i did the 90 minute film packs a lot of punch and the first 30 minutes zoom by setting the storyline for the rest of the film so watch carefully lili taylor and courtney love the leading ladies are both excellent in their roles as relatively unhappy hoboken nj housewives julie played by taylor embarks on a mission to get her ged against her husbands wishes she eventually kicks him out claire played by love her best friend from high school leaves her husband with no place to go claire moves in with julie and her 2 children in the meantime julie begins her quest for knowledge passing her ged and eventually turning her goals towards a college degree notice we still do n't have much of a love story do we midway through the film that all changes in a compassionate yet confusing manner without giving away the entire story line which includes a few very funny scenes amongst most of the drama two women must come to terms with their feelings for each other and for themselves this is really a gem of a film and as i have said before it is a shame this will not be seen by many some whom desperately need to see a story like this if brokeback mountain and transamerica can make the big screen well then so should julie johnson this is not a lesbian love story this is a story about relationships and the journey most of us take to achieve happiness and love in our own lives buy rent or see julie johnson
how do you twist and turn the most obnoxious individual with a completely disgusting job into a hero that is black magic after some time you begin to wish him well and feel tempted to light up this lovely satire on political correctness lobbyism and corruption draws you into the unbearable lightness of smooth talking if you argue correctly you can not be wrong right eckhart is perfect in the main part there are many nice smaller parts but my favorite is the little boy playing the hero 's son the boy deserves a nomination for best supporting actor actually he looks like scarlet 's little brother sometimes are they related
i tend to be hard on a lot of major motion pictures because to be frank they mostly suck however this only turned into a major motion picture '' after fox searchlight bought it after it 's screening at the sundance film festival before that it was the vision of fledgling director jason reitman to independently bring christopher buckley 's tremendously smart and funny book of the same name to the screen and he does a good job there 's a reason why this film is loaded with the mostly unpaid or underpaid who 's who of hollywood talent the script and screenplay are that good this is not the typical riden crap you 're used to seeing out of hollywood there are good acting performances throughout as well if you are a person of above average wit and have a dry sense of humor you 'll like it
jason reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy you for smoking ' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father ivan reitman made despite the film 's plot about one nick naylor ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry you for smoking ' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues aaron eckhart delivers a superb performance as nick naylor a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry who in his ' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on tv show nick is also a good father to his son joey cameron bright before whom nick tries to be a role model today nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement how about showing hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship he flies to california with his son meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono rob lowe and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man sam elliott who is about to sue the tobacco company the satire is funny but its target changes frequently it could be tobacco industry why not but also could be those politicians represented by william macy 's senator who seems very hostile to nick and nick himself sometimes the story goes too far which includes a brief episode of abduction but it is most effective when it shows nick 's darkly funny conversations with his friends lobbyists for alcohol and guns mari bello and david koechner calling themselves mod squad over their lunch other cast includes robert duvall adam brody kim dickens simmons and katie holmes the acting is unanimously good but the film belongs to eckhart 's nick naylor or his art of spin the film may lack the ideas about the social issues still what you see in you for smoking ' is always amusing clever and even absurdly funny and is never boring
thank you for not smoking is one damn sharp movie ! this movie ends before it starts its one of those where you want to rewind it in the middle of watching just to make sure that you did n't miss any thing yes it 's just that blunt if aaron eckard who plays big tobacco lobbyist does not condition you to think differently about smoking or some thing other conversational topic then maybe you need to watch this movie again the body of the message of this film portrays is not that you should pick up smoking that is it right and that you should go out and buy your child a pack on their birthday but rather this movie 's real message is about challenging the viewer to think for himself or herself amen ! a film that makes people to think for themselves in the world of movies where you walkout dumber than you go in and then you wonder why did i just pay for that naylor 's job is to get himself caught in the middle of the controversy of smoking in america his message is that people should think for themselves and that big tobacco needs customers so it to their benefit of people who have cancer to continue to smoke and if they die it would be a loss for the smoking industry naylor 's personal and professional life are one in the same as he is convinced himself that when you on the right side of the argument you can never be wrong and even if you have to change your argument half way through it you can always be right even when right is all negotiable for all the films produced today that believe their causes are to inform and pump information into your head fact or fiction thank you for not smoking ask you the question of whether or not thinking that way is correct and if so why it moves very fast and will not be film that you decide to turn off half way through includes many bonus features and gives you a real life view of how this movie was produced and what was the inspiration of making such a movie
there 's not a lot you need to know about thank you for smoking except that it 's a gleefully jaundiced perfectly paced adaptation of christopher buckley 's novel as a teacher who used to lead a class on critical thinking i took particular pleasure in the witty spins '' glib lobbyist nick naylor treats us to as he advocates for big tobacco sidelight not one person in this film actually smokes a cigarette and special to excellent supporting actors david koechner as gun advocate bobby jay bliss and simmons as budd '' rohrabacher oh and rob lowe is actually darned funny in his role i guess he can act after all
the most surprising and refreshing thing about jason reitman 's thank you for smoking is that no one smokes not tobacco lobbyist nick naylor not the alcohol and guns lobbyists not the investigative reporter and certainly not the vermont cheese senator this is a nutty and witty comedy satire that reminded me fondly of the 1940 's preston sturges comedies with their zany dialogue and flawless supporting casts smoking 's key character nick naylor aaron eckhart in the performance of his career to date is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic divorced with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for naylor believes that americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will he knows he manufactures a product that causes death but he can be wickedly hilarious about it like with cancer boy on the joan lunden show why would i want this young boy to die we would lose one more potential adult smoker '' then he invades an elementary school classroom where one little girl tells him my mommy says that cigarettes can kill you '' oh is your mommy a doctor a scientific researcher then maybe she does n't have all the facts '' this is a hysterically funny and inspired satire curiously the villain of the piece may be william macy as the unpleasant vermont senator who sells cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks '' replies nick nick also has a reporter dawson creek 's katie holmes want to do a story on him the two end up as literally strange bedfellows meanwhile the head of the tobacco lobby robert duvall dies of lung cancer and the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for americans ' rights to drink and fire guns hopefully not at the same time the source here is a novel by christopher buckley and it must be a lulu it would be fun to know whether or not buckley smokes i am a lifelong with asthma nick naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke knowing the dangers of cigarettes the movie makes such a complex case for both sides which is a tribute to director reitman 's brilliant screenplay one wishes both it and eckhart 's fabulous performance could be oscar nominees next spring for this 2006 comedy delight but the whole cast is a dream macy holmes duvall maria bello adam brody and the dialogue is brilliant if you want a good time at the movies do n't even consider missing the wonderfully funny thank you for smoking on dvd the movie is in panavision and letterboxed on dvd bonuses include a superb charlie rose show with buckley reitman eckhart and producer david sacks an audio commentary i do not recommend until a second viewing of the movie two filmmaking featurettes and deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary
i had heard good reviews about this film and quite often this leads to let down upon viewing but i am happy to say that this was not one of those times the writing is slick and humorous and the acting is great all round this film is clever and different and overall a good break from a lot of the junk we 've been subjected to lately whilst not one of those films you would rave '' about it is very entertaining and definately worth a look
of all the films i watched this year this one impressed me the most it is well directed edited acted and shot it deals with an extremely controversial issue by attacking it head on and making both sides laugh at themselves thank you for smoking is both hilarious and terrifying at the same you ca n't help but fall in love with one of the most despicable morally vacant characters ever to grace the big screen when he gets what 's coming to him you fell sorry for the guy and root for him to come out on top if you want to laugh your butt off while learning a little something about how to succeed in american politics and big business watch this film !
back in my younger days i probably would 've filled an entire wall of my house with vhs tapes of my favourite childhood tv shows knight rider airwolf and of course the thanks to the wonders of modern technology i can now store the first four seasons in a small corner of my shelf looking at the series through adult eyes it 's absolutely amazing to see just how well this show has stood the test of time when i was young i enjoyed the totally implausible but action scenes as an older and wiser man i enjoy it for the charisma of its four main stars they all have a sense of fun camraderie and joie de vivre about life in general that you just do n't find in shows nowadays it 's amazing to see just how popular these shows still are like everyone else i sometimes wish they 'd bring shows like this back characters like michael knight stringfellow hawke and hannibal smith and provided some truly great role models that most of todays modern tv shows sorely lack i would n't have grown up to be the man i am today without them
this was the season when the was the highest rated television this comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with george peppard t dwight shultz and dirk benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television this season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of stephen cannell the big squeeze and incident at crystal late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich such as bullets and bikinis and timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun this season was before the cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive and the formula was in full force so if you like to watch elaborate con jobs or even the worst or best shots in the cinema pick up this season
i 'm probably one of the biggest fan of the ever since i was a little kid and would watch the show each day when reruns were on tv when i started noticing that dvd 's were going to be released from various shows my first thought was that oh i can finally get this on dvd ! '' well i have picked up the first three seasons so far and although i 'm thrilled to have each of the episodes i 'm dissappointed on another level for a number of reasons most of the sets out there are filled with bonus features and rare we get none of that with any of the box sets that have come out so far and i doubt we will it 's not like this show was on for a few months and got cancelled it ran nearly 100 episodes on nbc ! would n't you think there would be something that would enthuse us fans ! i have some other gripes about it but i guess i should n't be complaining that much at least it 's out on dvd compared to some other shows that have failed to make it to release yet
back when i was in elementary school i used to watch the a team every tuesday night at pm i already have seasons 1 and 2 and ca n't wait to but this one i 'll also be buying season 4. but season 5. jeez i hated season 5. that 's one of the major reasons the show went of the air in season 5 the style of the series changed drastically became less fun and quirky i recall the episodes becoming more serious and drama like it just did n't compare to the first four seasons nonetheless i 'm glad i 'll be able to add the rest of the episode to my all time favorite tv series
complete third season is now available on dvd the dual sided dvd box set includes all 25 episodes from the shows season the was a very popular series during the 80 's t owes much of his 1980 's success to the t as did n't really have as much screen time as hannibal george peppard or the characters of face and murdock but he is easily the most recognizable member of the cast season 3 similar to previous seasons was filled adventure exotic locals disguises and interesting situations the season begins with the episode bullets and bikinis '' airdate when the mob attempts to take over a hotel the to rescue her hotel in a strange twist the two part episode the bend in the river '' falls into the slot of the second and third episodes of the season usually when a series has a two part episode early in the season that episode is used as the season premiere well the bend in the river '' is actually a slow episode which may explain why it was not used as the season premiere in this episode an archeologist is traveling in the amazon region looking for secrets but he finds conflict with local pirates and bad guy named el cahon soon hannibal is seen on a movie set dressed up in a monster costume as the aquamaniac after he is fired face tries to convince the producer to keep him on with no film work keeping them occupied they decide to help tanya the archeologists girlfriend find her missing archeologist boyfriend by season three the had begun to lose a little of it 's magic and fan base compared to miami vice the seemed a little quirky and corny at times despite this it was still a great show and fans of the show should add season three to their collection because there were some good episodes during the season season three special guests include markie post nightcourt dennis franz nypd blue and kristen meadows
directed by steve pink whose previous credits includes writing the screenplay and the films grosse pointe blank 1997 and high fidelity 2000 accepted 2006 stars justin long galaxy quest jeepers creepers dodgeball a true underdog story as bartleby ' gaines a recently graduated high school student who after being rejected from every college he applied to decides to create a fictional school rather than face the humiliation of his peers and disappointment of his parents also appearing is jonah hill grandma 's boy click adam herschman blake lively the sisterhood of the traveling pants columbus short save the last dance 2 maria thayer strangers with candy '' anthony heald the silence of the lambs travis van winkle transformers and commentator lewis black jacob 's ladder as the film begins we meet a klutzy ferris bueller type named bartleby ' gaines who upon learning he 's gotten his application rejected from like his seventh or eighth college decides with the help of his friend sherman hill to make up a fictional school called south harmon institute of technology which is supposedly a sister school to a local and real institute of higher education why well mainly to appease his parents particularly his father who 's kind of an pretty soon the lie begins to snowball and bartleby is forced to come up with an actual facility to which he takes the money his parents gave him for tuition and leases a decrepit building that once was used as a psychiatric hospital with the help of his friends they fix it up enough to pass it off as a school along with bringing in sherman 's slightly crazy uncle ben lewis to act as the dean bartleby manages to scam his parents well enough but guess what sherman who created the web page for the fictional school made the site a little too realistic and pretty soon a slew of dregs dweebs mutants malcontents and spaz types none of whom could get into other schools begin showing up tuition in hand believing they 've gotten accepted to south harmon rather than crush their dreams bartleby decides make the school by letting the students make up their own classes based on what they want to learn things seem to go well for a while that is until dean van horne heald who presides over the real harmon decides he wants the land adjacent to his university for expansion purposes south harmon just happens to be on that land eventually bartleby 's sham is exposed but his school has become something more than intended an actual learning institution and bartleby and his friends opt for a long shot in trying to get the school accredited and avoid going to jail under fraud charges all in all i thought this film albeit formulaic was funny and fairly entertaining the plot is pretty unrealistic but then it is a screwy comedy so it helps if you suspend a good deal of disbelief as i said the plot 's formulaic as you have the standard setup of the main character creating a wacky situation one that eventually gets out of hand ultimately crashing down around his ears resulting in a last ditch effort to save the day there 's also a love interest element as bartleby 's has it bad for a character played by blake lively who in turn is dating slimy snobby president of the fraternity both of whom go to the real harmon eventually she comes to see her boyfriend for what he is and takes up with bartleby thinking he 's all cool and the real deal which results in disappointment as she discovers most everything he 's presented himself as in terms of the school is fake will bartleby be able to save the day and get the girl probably i thought all the performers did pretty well including long himself who seems a charming and personable fellow but the character i enjoyed most was that of sherman played by jonah hill he was sort of the token chubby awkward nerdlinger but he was also really funny especially when he was trying to fit in with the fraternity types you see sherman got accepted to the real harmon and was pledging the main fraternity as a legacy but the so called ' types seemed only interested in humiliating him as much as possible there 's plenty of crazy characters running around that manage to keep things interesting probably the wackiest a character named glen herschman a misfit who got fired from the local for making a shrimp slushy he was both hungry and thirsty lewis black pulls his shtick out for the film as he can be seen ranting on in his usual fashion and provides a few comical moments as an unorthodox dean as this was pink 's directorial debut i thought he did extremely well as he really kept things lively and moving along at a good pace another aspect that helped a lot was an rousing soundtrack which included some good tunes from bands like the pixies green day citizen cope modest mouse weezer the hives and the cure to name a few the picture presented in anamorphic widescreen on this dvd looks sharp and the dolby digital 5.1 audio available in english french and spanish comes across well extras include an audio commentary track with director pink and performers justin long lewis black jonah hill and adam herschman also included is a comical bit entitled adam 's accepted chronicles a making of featurette titled rejection the making of accepted ' a campus tour a couple of music videos some deleted scenes and music files from the film accessible through your computer by the way take the first letter from each word in the name of the school south harmon institute of technology what does that spell this joke is played on a lot throughout the movie
accepted is an enjoyable comedy although a little hard to believe bartelby gaines is a high school senior who has one major problem he has n't been accepted into any of the college and university 's that he applied to not even the state university that was his fall back choice tired of not having an answer for the where are you going '' question and dismayed at disappointing his parents bartely comes up with an idea in the beginning it 's just an acceptance letter he creates a letter stating that he was accepted to south harmon institute of technology he even has his friend create a website then he starts to think his idea might really work when his father hands him a check to pay his tuition in full he decides to create a real college he leases an old dilapidated school building that was once a mental facility and creates a college dorm rooms and all the plan just keeps going and going students enroll and they even find a dean before he knows it he has thousands of students show up at the made up school the film is hilarious and comes from the same studio that released american pie i really loved this movie dvd special features include deleted scenes gag reel reject making of accepted more the film 's soundtrack is pretty hot too and includes songs from modest mouse the hives citizen cope weezer and ryan adams among others accepted is rated and is now available on dvd
i do n't know why people are writing essays on this particular movie but i thought it was pretty funny and entertaining i enjoyed it some parts could 've been funnier than they were but for the most part the movie did it 's job me laugh ! ! ! !
my friend suzanne took me to see accepted three weeks ago probably to celebrate my new hire as an adjunct lecturer in the english department of queensborough community college in the movie high school graduate bartelby gaines a name with literary overtones at least the first name ca n't get accepted to the staid harmon college in his hometown in ohio or to any other school to get his parents off his back the inventive bartelby justin long using his computer invents an acceptance letter from the south harmon institute of technology get it bartelby to complete the ruse gets his friend harmon freshman sherman schrader jonah hill to create a website for the bogus school but the website works too well and bartelby is faced with hundreds of college rejects looking for acceptance so in the confines of an abandoned mental hospital bartelby and friends create a college really an adult education center or community center where students design their own courses design clothes in the school colors brown and blue get it create the school newspaper the build a skateboarding rink and listen to radical lectures from a lewis black however harmon college 's traditionalist dean van horne boston public 's anthony heald and the fraternity brothers have reasons to close the new school down sure the plot is improbable as one tv reviewer said have n't they ever heard of community college '' but if you look past the silly plot and episodes there 's a real message hear about academic freedom creativity and appeal to students in my years at cuny and even at pace university i was never subject to the extreme whitebread culture of harmon college and i 'm not sure i want to be even beyond the college trappings of accepted one can see the battle between the desire to mold oneself into acceptability by class white america and the desire to be oneself and build toward a true calling by following one 's heart and interests perhaps we teachers can cull some real lessons from the looney bin of accepted btw accepted fully exploits one or two curse words and excises the rest
accepted is quite entertaining it works as a mashup of animal house without the bite and nerds without the overstatement while fairly predictable it manages to avoid standard hollywood development the lines are good delivered well and reasonably believable accepted never takes itself too seriously and neither should we there are some fairly strong shots taken at the crumbling industrial age establishment most are well presented and reflect the growing disenchantment with tertiary education one particularly strong point made is that the primary purpose of a college degree has become personal marketing today a degree is just a tool to get a job there are some obvious flaws in the reality of the show most students that miss both their primary and fall back schools would just go to a community college and then transfer after two years if you have a diploma from yale few are going to question if you spent all four years there being unaccredited is not a crime many colleges such as bastiat free university are proudly unaccredited the crime is the fraud of stating you are accredited when you are not with internet access the costs of maintaining accreditation infrastructure is becoming an unnecessary burden on students and the school learning is coming of age the movie accepted is a fun loving fulcrum for levering in that reality if you can overlook the artistic license taken the movie itself is enjoyable the ideas so softly presented should resonate with perceptive visionaries as the industrial age bureaucracies deflate or implode technologically empowered individuals will fill the void accepted takes the dull vagueness of that prior statement and provides it with a well honed comedic point accepted is worth watching
this is the first novel of john grisham and like the movie it 's very strong in characters and dialogue at the time he wrote it there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer ' movies witness for the prosecution '' comes to mind and we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like parker crais lehane george and grafton but the novel was uncharted land and grisham plowed it over with a passion how was grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given evil empire '' writers like len deighton and john lecarre fits eventually the public would tire at lawyers even laughing at them nevertheless it 's a good book and also an excellent movie if there are drawbacks then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust the lawfirm itself for example sexual misconduct in a lawfirm sure misconduct in billing always stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains occasionally but murdering associates who try to leave i do n't think so but it does give department of justice cop ed harris a great line in the movie mcdeere no one has left your firm alive ! '' the movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it the lovely jeanne tripplehorn the this time not very grandfatherly wilfred brimley holly hunter always a hoot gary busey hal holbrook and law and order 's steven hill to mention a few and tom cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and abbey 's rainbow has a hazmat sticker on it that he 's overlooked cruise is just great a true hitchkockian character the average man with no where to run what would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom that 's the firm 5 stars larry scantlebur
nothing can be better than the firm '' written by john grisham who himself is a lawyer the attentions to details that grisham manages to pull are just fantastic i read the book before watching the movie and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book as the book gets slow in between but not the movie cruise 's is superb so are the other actors in this movie i do n't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios this is a movie based on a fiction novel and as rightly said by one of reviewer here it does its job by entertaining the audiences
the story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues the real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives i had to watch the movie 's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished i wonder what lawyers fbi agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie most of us do n't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot the good guy mitch mcdeere wins over evil not only because he 's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck mitch is so lucky that the story strains example mitch 's wife gets to know all of a sudden that gene hackman 's character who has important documents to copy is not going to dive as mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him well good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life at the same time the movie shows legal procedures by real life lawyer john grisham the movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished in real life criminals hardly ever go to jail even less killed by the good guys everybody knows this what not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems the movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into finally the suspense is well organized moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes yes this is very compelling movie to recommend watching beware that this movie deals at some degree with the conservative vs liberal cultural war the bad guys had to be the southern conservatives who want to rule other people 's lives according to their own hypocrite standards meanwhile the good guys are liberals from ne i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows in negative ways all i guess is that jg realized what would be accepted by the entertainment industry and wrote according to it anyways this is just a movie and it does what it 's supposed to do to entertain
this is a smartly written and drama tom cruise plays a sharp young harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob great supporting help from gene hackman and wilford brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors
the firm a great story and an amazing movie read the story and just now i watched the movie great to read the story and then watch its movie be able to see what you imagined while reading the book ! i recomend the firm to all ! and if you can get the book and read it first be more fun ! trust me ! enjoy
the dvd is great and so was the price the movie is excellent ! ! ! ca n't stop watching it !
i read the book and then the book i saw the movie not once but twice it is somewhat different from the book i like pollock a lot his movies are so interesting to me that i could'nt wait for the movie to come out the acting was well done only one flaw casting tom cruise in this otherwise well developed movie everyone else does a great job of acting here to me though tom is miscasted he seems to be out of place his thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but he just did'nt click of what sidney wanted the character to be and do sorry cruise fans he is wasted as far as i am concerned gene hackman and as well as ed harris they did well a great movie but could have been better without cruise here
good grief this dvd was excellent ! the commentary was fun and interesting if the listeners would listen more carefully the only part playing while they spoke was the intro over and over not much of the songs were missed at all are we cheap trick fans or not i am ! ! ! yeah ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! encore ! !
i guess i did n't have the grandiose expectations that some ct fans did because i think the ftty dvd is super ! of course this might have something to do with the recent purchase of my first dvd player yes very slow here to update to new now old technology and purchasing my first ever ct dvd i can understand those who may find this dvd lacking in comparison to previous releases i 've seen a couple of ct performances and listened to several of their cds i love their songs but i thoroughly enjoy listening to them talk about their life experiences etc sometimes forthright often ambigous they never fail to make me smile yes it would have been a big plus for the band to sing more of their songs in entirety but all in all this did not diminish the quality for me i was just wondering where track number 16 is california man ''
it as wonderful to enjoy season 1 of hart to hart all over again the black tie the romance it was great !
hart to hart ! great family viewing spectacular scenery great relationships of the characters involved our family especially enjoys looking for the clues to solve the crimes everyone can do this without undue graffic violence obscenities or blatant sex getting mixed into the scenes if you enjoy mysteries try hart to hart diagnosis murder or murder she wrote just to name a few
well now that we have two seasons down and i 've watched all my disc over and over and over when do we expect the others to be released
hart to hart is a modern day take on the thin man it has everything the thin man did including the dog freeway except the baby this 70 's hit had adventure romance and mystery all rolled up in an hour robert wagner and stephaine powers seem like they are meant for each other tbey pair so show created by sidney sheldon i dream of jeanne and produced by aaron spelling with leonard goldburg and the quality shows through even years and years later waiting for the seven seasons to be on dvd bennet pomerantz audioworl
i gave the item five stars although i have n't viewed it it is a gift but this review is about new unacceptable amazon packaging for this item i ordered this item as a christmas gift i received it in a brown box with a shipping label when the box was turned over there was a hole in the box approiximately 2.5 '' x 3.5 '' exposing the invoice the order number content information and price were all visible through the hole if you are concerned about privacy or if you are buying this as a gift and wish to keep the contents secret from another household member you may want to purchase this item elsewhere or make plans to be the only one picking up the mail until after it arrives i have purchased many things from amazon and this is the first time i have received anything in this type of box i hope it will be the last
i have to agree with the positive reviews already posted this is the best quality set that i 've bought so far ! the dvds are nicely packaged in 3 slim cases 2 discs per case each disc is yes ! with nice graphics on the side i 've only watched a few episodes so far but i was very impressed with the picture and sound and also appreciated that the dvd started right up with the feature menu and i did n't have to past a bunch of previews commercials i hope other studios use this set as an example of how to do a dvd release right
i was just a kid when this show was on and i loved every episode of it back then it looked sleek chic exciting everything you could ask for from a tv show just like charlie 's angels or vega i remember them all almost 30 years later it looks so dated so different from today 's fast paced violent loud tv still we love it the stories are so simple and wagner and powers had so much charm so much style let me add that today i guess i still secretly dream about having a 1978 yellow wagon with that big telephone laughs it used to be so super cool ! ! ! wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 kid just being introduced to late 70 's television the jokes the kitchens the hairdos the telephones vcrs big cars disco oh and i loved mark snow 's theme i recognized it instantly and max 's introduction to and h whose hobby is murder ! ! ! do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class ' during the late 70 's watch hart to hart everything was great everything was ideal ! what a great show ! thanks for the memory ps someday someone will write a history of american society through the century 's tv shows ' point of view i 'm sure hart to hart charlie 's angels moonlighting magnum pi and many many others will all have a lot to say
hart to hart second season to be released in september finally hopefully the other seasons will follow in a timely manner
love it ! love it ! love it ! hart to hart was one of my favorite shows growing up i watched it each week it so good to see the show again i could not find the episodes anywhere on cable the only thing is now i need the additional seasons ! !
hart to hart '' in eine in deutschland sehr beliebte fernsehserie die seit jahren fast ununterbrochen im deutschen fernsehen gezeigt wird
the film was excellant there was lots of action there was also great well known actors in it to there was no bad langauge and no sex scene's
if youre ever in the mood for a laugh out load comedy do n't bother with wedding crashers the bench warmers or any other pathetically boring movie rent this and laugh the whole way through that 's exactly what me and my friend did last week and i have to admit i was laughing so hard i would have to pause the movie until the laughing fit ended this really is one of the best comedies of the last decade highly reccomended
patrick swayze meatloaf randy travis trucks pure unadulterated awesomeness
for pure testosterone pumping action black dog is a slammer the truck chase sequences are exciting and you find yourself rooting for the underdog hero convincingly played by patrick swayze randy travis and meat loaf chew up the scenery with travis coming across a little more believable than the histrionic meat loaf but the movie moves well and has some great action sequences a little over the top at times but black dog delivers what you would expect for this type of film
sometimes you 've got take a movie for what it is and what it is meant to do although i notice a majority of the reviews here are positive some people just do n't get it this is a fun action packed 2 hours approx the dvd widescreen transfer is awesome and the 5.1 audio will blow you away ! ! the only thing i have to say negative about the movie is the ending kinda leaves ya goin ' huh that 's it '' check it out
when i watched black dog for the first time i thought is was one of the best movies i had ever seen now that i have seen it i watch it over and over again what makes the movie so great is that it has awsome soundtrack to go along with it from randy travis singing my worst fear '' and rhett akins singing eddie rabbits driving my life away '' i would recomend that everyone watch this movie at least once in your life i would expecially recomend it if you are a truck driver it is so easy to comprehend with what they go through even if you arnt a truck driver it gives yo a little respect of what they have to go through just hopefully not so much drama with dealing being away from the ones that you love for just doing the job that they choose to do
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time i bought the movie and the soundtrack is awesome excellent truck driving in the movie very exciting it kept me intrigued through the whole movie as to what was going to happen acting is very good patrick swayze is such a handsome man he was the best part of the whole movie but everyone did a great and his men got exactly what they you enjoy a good action movie you will enjoy this would rate it a 10
this is a good action movie if you have never driven a truck then some of the details of the film probably will be lost on you however anyone who likes action and the trucking lifestyle should enjoy this movie i give it two thumbs quot
the movie 's plot is simplistic jack crews swayze and earl randy travis must deliver a load of illegal weapons or the terrorists kill jack 's family in addition they must fend off red meat loaf a fanatical bible yelling madman and his redneck thugs who are attempting to steal the cargo anyone who enjoys explosions and big rigs will like this movie red 's men try to hijack the guns several times and each time their attempts fail usually with some impressive crash in fact all of red 's crew are either blown up splattered all over the pavement or crushed within a truck cab there are some good lines about how juice causes gas and what atf really stands for it 's not the most intellectual movie out there and swayze 's facial expression never does change but with the number of explosions and huge trucks who cares in any event you 'll find out how deadly trucking really can be
considerng the adult humor and partial nudity i was lucky as a kid to even be allowed to watch this movie on cable especially since the blue lagoon '' came out shortly beforehand my parents probably thought this was an innocent little film about mermaids some 22 years later the movie still manages to be funny and charming plus now i get all the jokes who can resist a tale about finding the woman of your dreams who turns out to be more than what you bargained for if you watch the credits at the end of the movie you 'll see the underwater city that madison came from something i had never noticed before ron howard eugene levy tom hanks daryl hannah and john candy probably never this movie would be the platform for making them huge stars some twenty years later this is a classic and a keeper future generations will enjoy as well
this was one of my favorites when i was a kid i decided to buy it for a girls night out it went over very well i even watched it with my husband who found it very entertaining extra features on the dvd are interesting but do n't add a whole lot to the film itself
how can people imagine a man change to mermaid ! ha ha ha tom hanks did it
splash '' is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80 's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then i actually saw this movie when it was first released which is rare for me since i was only a kid back in the 80 's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days i first bought it on vhs eventually upgraded to the dvd and now have upgraded yet again to this anniversary edition dvd i just ca n't get enough of this movie both tom hanks and daryl hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple what 's also believable in this movie is daryl hannah 's mermaid costume which looks so authentic that one almost believes she 's really a mermaid and let 's not forget the movie 's ending which is absolutely perfect there 's one thing about this movie that i 've never understood though how did it ever manage to escape a rating in the scene where daryl hannah arrives at the statue of liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial and may i add very nice shot of her buns definitely not material for a pg rated movie in any event i guess that will always be a mystery all in all splash '' is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it everyone is great to watch including hilarious supporting roles by the late john candy and eugene levy now if only they would release a special edition dvd of big '' another tom hanks classic
ok this is basically all you need to know daryl hannah is a mermaid that right there is reason enough to own this movie she 's also wet through a good portion of the movie oh yeah did i mention she was a mermaid
what really good fun ! ! my whole family enjoyed these dvds to the fullest really wonderful with the feeling of rome and a personalized view of the history we often travel to italy and this was a taste '' without the trip
everything about this show is awesome the script is well tight the actors are 100 terrific and the production makes you really feel like you are watching things happen in ancient rome i loved watching this show on hbo not only because i love ancient rome but because i was very interested in the characters anybody who studied the time of caesar in high school will know what happens to the major characters but in addition to the real stories this show is full of drama sex and violence then again so were those times people were not as afraid of their sexuality as they are today and people did n't think twice about watching people die in an arena the romans and this show really make you feel the exhileration of life and death
an excellent series well presented through the dvd format worth the time to watch and worth the money to purchase
i was 'hooked'to this dvd collection from the get go my husband and i are history freaks but we have kids and many of the scenes especially the first dvds were too explicit i do n't recommend it to families with small children though we had to wait until they went to sleep to watch an episode still each episode left us wanting for more the scenes were spectacular with many details of ancient rome however when you have good knowledge on the subject you can tell that not everything is right on the money or on the historical facts i should say still it was a great production
i found this item to be an excellent source for a look at daily life in rome while it does abbreviate the historical events it is still a real look into the political undercurrents of the times the nudity would make this not suitable for children
really captures the grit violence sex and intrigue of ancient rome i also love that it featured characters of many social levels usually we only see the lives of wealthy romans well acted well written great costumes and sets and the women are beautiful which was a plus for me !
great acting direction costumes story editing and great special features the commentaries are interesting with none of the wah wah wah me '' or just me me me '' from the director which has ruined so many other movie commentaries for me well worth the money since there are so many hours of fun always want to watch it all again a month later five big stars hj
the series was extremely well done and provided a dramatization of caesar 's struggle for rome cast was outstanding and the costumes scenes and overall production quality was very high there has to be praise for hbo 's taking an historical topic and translating it into a series the only reason i did n't give five stars for this was because a couple of the episodes lacked the punch '' that i expected from each particularly following the first two episodes
i can not say anything bad about this series it was masterfully written and directed
this is an exceptional series which got lost on tv trust me this is agreat series well worth your time
edwin is a great live at the house of blues is a very good dvd edwin has a loyal following and if you are just a casual fan you might be converted to the edwin army after you view this while i am sure some fans would like to have their edwin favorite tune included on this dvd lets face it there just is n't enough time to get them all in one show or dvd with 14 performance songs and 5 additional tunes on the bonus cd this is a great to experience what a loyal group of followers already know edwin can sing a story ! edwin picked a place not to far from home in a venue that showcases his strenghts well i enjoy the banter between songs the band is always excellent most of these folks have been playing with him for quite some time they are tight pete riley does a fine job on backing vocals as far as song selection just because it does n't have several i would have loved to go be young '' and what matters '' i am not going to count that see remark above my choice for favs on the dvd are my mystery the opening tune i 'll be and maggie may if there is one little thing to nit pick it would be the quality of the camera work on the dvd there are some jump cuts and the far shots of the band playing make it not as crisp as i might have expected again i am a fan not a person it is something that just strikes me and i am probably alone in that botton line is this is a excellent purchase even better if you have a chance to see edwin live by all means do it either way you will want the dvd it is a fine representation of what the edwin mccain band is and how fine of concert they perform
scream and whisper is awesome but if you have n't gotten the new dvd tinsel tap shoes '' you are missing out the dvd is the answer for everyone who has been asking for a live concert on dvd and to make it better there is a bonus audio cd in the same package get s w first then buy the dvd do n't pass go do n't collect 200 this dvd was filmed over 2 days at the house of blues myrtle beach one of my favorite edwin venues both nights were magical and they picked the for this dvd if you have never seen edwin and the band live this will give you a hint of what you can expect to hear and see in person you will not regret buying this dvd ! ! ! ! they are already having a contest if you have n't signed up yet please sign up asap ! once you join you can get others to join and there goes your first contest ! please copy the form below fill it out only personal info and 3 questions and return to edwinmccainmessenger drt assures us they will not use our names and info for anything except the street team ! you 'll help me and drt will contact you soon about the street team ! thanks guys ! copy all of the form below ! all information is for the street this will not be sent to other companies recruited by angie little first name last name email address street address city state zip code date of birth info telephone number favorite top 5 why do you want to be a part of the drt street team what can you do that is creative and different from others on the street team thanx for signing up all of the information will be plugged into our database shall hear from drt shortly
once in a decade or so comes a talent this huge that edwin mccaine can write from such a perspective belies his age song after song his words touch the heart bringing forth tears of both joy and sadness and that 's just the lyrics the voice how can it be that one so young can sing with so much soul song after song delivering just the right emotion to drive his poetry home the perfect balance of melody and driving soul do n't for a moment try to group edwin 's music in with the talentless marketing packages that are so prevalent these days his talent eclipses any 50 of these combined ! on to the dvd i found this to be an excellent sampler of edwin 's music his band consistently kicks out the songs with nary a wrong note personal favorites are coming down '' and shooting stars '' the high point of the dvd is beautiful life '' in which edwin 's band cuts loose if i had anything to complain about it would be that though every song is delivered impeccably the band plays it all a little too safe for my tastes the exception is the aforementioned beautiful life '' which shows what they 're capable of i only wished they 'd stretched like that on a few more songs so if you have n't hit the buy now '' button yet go ahead and do it you wo n't be sorry while you 're at it pick out a few of his cd 's there 's nary a bad one in the bunch a further testament to the talent of this young man !
edwin mccain is arguably the best lyricist and songwriter of the last decade this dvd catches he and his band in a period of rebirth in their music these are songs to capture your soul
i too was at that concert ! it was such an intmate playing space and everyone was so excited it 's awesome to see that others who were there posted here on amazon it was a great way to end a vacation i highly recommend this dvd the performance of gramercy park hotel one of my favorite songs was just fun and the other ballads and songs were beautiful buy this dvd and go find him live many bands do n't understand the importance of live music but these guys do ! enjo
i have been following edwin 's music for the past 7 years he does n't seem to tour much out west but i was able to finally see him live in reno on october edwin was so genuine autographed 5 of the cds i had by him he was incredible then and this dvd shows what a dynamic performance he can give his live show included all of the songs on this dvd if you have bought his latest cd scream and whisper '' you will love the live performance of shooting stars '' he does an awsome cover of rod stewart 's maggie may '' larry chaney and craig sheilds really come through on this dvd also ca n't miss on this one
if you sort of like edwin mccain get this dvd watch him live and you will fall in love he has such passion for his music that can only be seen and felt during live performances his amazing voice is just as amazing live and he and his band can jam ! ! the energy is high and its a great time ! i had the priviledge of meeting him and blubbered like an idiot but he is just as cool a guy as he seems he really appreciates his fan base and understands how important it is for us to see him live im glad that finally i can share with my friends who have never see edwin live what an amazing artist he really is ! ! ! !
although this dvd has n't been released i know it will be worth every penny spent ! i was at this concert and as usual not a disappointing moment ! edwin 's cds are incredible anyway but his live performances are incomparable his ballads are moving his upbeat songs get your feet tapping and his chemistry with his band is second to none ! if you have never seen one of his live shows buy this dvd and then log immediately on to his website and find out where you can see him asap ! his live performances whether they are full band or partial are experiences you never want to end
i know the dvd has not been released yet but i attended the concert at the house of blues in myrtle beach sc when this dvd was recorded and what an amazing night of music ! anyone who has ever listed to i 'll be '' has got to check out this dvd then run to your local cd store and purchase all of the edwin mccain band 's albums you will not be disappointed the edwin mccain band is so much more than a ballad band '' you will not be disappointed
i am an avid er fan and have been enjoying seeing the series for the second time i rate it as one of the best tv series ever done i am really looking forward to seeing the rest of the series and would like to know if you have any idea when er the complete fifth season '' will be available for purchase
the fourth season is one of the best this is er when it was still pure '' all of the old cast was still in place along with some new standouts
i will say right now that this review will probably be much longer than the other three i have written which were all pretty long themselves but i just finished watching this season after getting it for christmas so it 's very fresh in my mind season four of er '' is excellent and exciting dramatic television but i must say it does n't quite live up to the standard set by the amazing first three seasons do not take this as a negative however for the most part this season is excellent the only problem is a handful of episodes i could have done without i 'll start with the season premiere ambush '' this is the famous live episode that was performed twice once for the east coast and once for the west coast ok so yes this episode is a marvel of television and a technical masterpiece and it 's simply amazing that it managed to air at all and also that they did it twice in a row no less however i just do n't think this episode is very good at all in fact i hate it i think if it was n't for the fact that it aired live it would be counted among the worst episodes of the series if not the all time worst episode i 'm sorry but this episode is just completely cheesy and campy and really quite awful it has a whole different look from the other episodes being that it aired live and all and the whole style is like that of a different show i also think that the plot is stupid and unrealistic and only a gimmick for the excuse to show it live also the drama in this episode is really weak it feels more like a high school play than a serious high budget television series all in all a big dissapointment fortunately things get back on track after this disastrous episode but there are still two episodes that lower the rating for me the first one is fathers and sons '' and the second one is family practice '' i have heard of people who like these episodes a lot but i am not one of them i believe the show is called er '' and to have two episodes that do n't even take place in the er is just stupid to me the acting and all in these episodes is fine and we do learn a lot about ross and greene but i just prefer it when the show takes place in the hospital plus these episodes seriously lack the ensemble power of great er '' the only cast members to appear in fathers and sons '' are anthony edwards george clooney and julianna margulies and then family practice '' has anthony edwards going completely solo ! i do n't understand why a celebrated ensemble show would have episodes with only three cast members in it or just one in the case of family practice '' aside from these episodes though er '' season four rolls along smoothly the adventures continue and the characters grow for example mark greene anthony edwards mark has some real trouble this season he 's still all bent out of shape after the brutal beatdown he got in the previous season and is still fighting to get the person he suspects beat him thrown in prison also mark has a memorable romantic fling with mariska hargitay who plays cynthia hooper for an extended run this season doug ross geoge clooney doug and carol are finally together in this season after three seasons of being apart doug has plenty of excitement this year and a top example is his relationship with carol also he illegally tries to help detox a little baby and gets in major trouble with greene for it john carter noah wyle we get a large glimpse into the family life on carter this season when we meet his grandmother played by the always excellent frances sternhagen and his drug addicted cousin carter works hard to cure his cousin of his drug addiction but in the end fails and takes the scoldings of his family members carter also has some romantic tension with del amico and makes a controversial decision with a known rapist carol hathaway julianna margulies 't is an exciting year for carol she comes up with an excellent plan to offer a free nursing center for poor people in the er and asks for the help of carter 's grandmother she also deals with commitment problems with ross and meets several woman who have been raped by the same man jeannie boulet gloria reuben it 's another sad but intense year for the wonderful boulet she is now back with her but he eventually leaves to get a job somewhere else after being fired from his job in chicago jeannie is left alone and forms a bond with anspaw 's sickly son she also fights hard to keep her job after she is let go and there is a good amount of tension between her and weaver kerry weaver laura innes weaver infuriates boulet when she is forced to fire her and takes some heat for this decision she also has a romantic affair with a man who wants her to invest into another company but ends us betrated and angry anna del amico maria bello this interesting character would unfortunately only be around for this season and this season only which makes it hard to really get into her character for what it 's worth she does get some very interesting storylines in her only season including romance with carter she also deals with her only personal beliefs in an episode where an abortion clinic is bombed one of the best of this season by the way she also has hardships when her old boyfriend returns to town elizabeth corday alex kingston season four introduces this character who will be around for quite awhile which we are all grateful for corday has a year of thrills when she comes to america to work at county general she ends up in a romantic relationship with benton and fights against the snide comments of resident jackass romano peter benton eriq la salle peter learns what it means to be a father in this season as he takes care of his new baby this brings out an interesting new aspect in peter 's character he also dates corday and this leads to some excellent storylines so there you have it season four of er '' has a pretty large cast as you can see although sherry stringfield is gone we get the addition of two new characters bringing the total cast up to nine characters despite my negative comments earlier i would like to state that er '' season four is a prime example of the show 's brilliance and an excellent year for those seeking classic er '' the dvd continues the high standards set by the previous three seasons the episodes are in anamorphic widescreen except for ambush '' which is still presented in fullscreen format and the picture quality is excellent the extras are actually my favorite of the four seasons currently out the documentaries about ambush '' are actually far better than the actual episode and give you a good idea of what a remarkable job it was to create this episode and put in on the screens the post shows for both versions of the episode are very interesting too if a bit too self congratulatory especially from john wells what can i say although i liked the first three seasons better season four is not far behind and is an excellent year of er '' truly pick it up today
er is a classic however george clooney makes it eye candy as well ! eric lasalle is also eye candy however george has a soft spot in my heart i was watching him back on the first er he was in with elliot gould anyway er is great although not as great after about season 6. the earlier episodes of a series are usually the best look at friends
from the incredible success of the season opening live episode ambush '' all the way to the crazy father shooting his family in the season finale er 's season four was full of fantastic story lines great writing phenomenal acting and just solid television er has been my favorite show for years and this season like the one before it was one of the strongest on record viewers got to see into the lives of the characters and even welcomed a few more people to the county general family the season premiere shot live twice once for the east coast and once for the west coast was a true inspiration an idea hatched by series stars anthony edwards and george clooney writer carol flint found a great way a documentary crew is in the er shooting to write cameras and such into the story and from there it is all the actors as they shine in their moment in the sun this season brings some changes to the county general staff kerry weaver laura innes is promoted to interim chief of emergency medicine after morgenstern guest star william macy has a heart attack in the season premiere her management style is quite brash and certainly irritates those who have to work for her her decision to first hire then not an outside management firm was made even more difficult by the fact that she was dating the man who was trying to bring the program into county guest star clancy brown elizabeth korday alex kingston comes across the pond to join the county general staff as a fellow under robert romano guest star and future series regular paul mccrane her introduction to american television is the live episode but her character goes through a lot in her first year she fights off the advances of romano instead chasing after fellow surgeon peter benton eriq lasalle she gets a first hand look at just how different things can be in the united states and as the season ends she finds herself looking for a way to stay after romano does n't renew her fellowship maria bello joins the regular cast as anna del amico an er resident she guest starred in the end of season three and in season four finds herself in a budding relationship with john carter noah wyle she also finds herself at odds with the filmmakers in the live episode and deals with the returning of a former boyfriend as the season comes to a close benton has to adjust to life as a father after having a son in the end of season three he also pursues a relationship with korday and makes a move when he questions the work of morgenstern pushing aside the senior doctor in a bold surgical room move he also has to deal with his son 's mother carla guest star lisa nicole carlson moving on with another man carter had a trying year as he had to deal with the drug addiction of his cousin chase guest star johnathan scarfe and also had to deal with humility when he decides to cut himself off from his family 's money and has to go back to being an intern after switching from surgery to emergency medicine perhaps the shining moment of this season is when carter takes control of the er after a toxic mishap and shows just what kind of doctor he can be something viewers got to see for years after doug ross clooney also did n't have an easy year as he went up against weaver with the suggestion of a pediatric er department with himself as pediatric attending the situation is still unresolved at the end of the season but it is just one more thing to put ross at odds with the bosses he also suffers the loss of his father in a car accident in californnia which leads to a great episode where he and mark greene anthony edwards travel to california together of course ross would n't be complete without nurse carol hathaway julianna margulies as the season begins the two are in a secret relationship but the truth soon comes out carol grows tired of the patient care and opens a free clinic in the er thanks to some timely funds from carter 's grandmother guest star frances sternhagen she also assists ross in a questionable procedure at the end of the season one that puts both of their careers in jeopardy greene pays a couple of visits to see his parents bonding with his father guest star john cullum on a second trip when his mother is mark is also still recovering from an attack in the men 's room in the previous season making him question just about everything in his life he gets in a relationship with desk clerk cynthia hooper guest star mariska hargitay and battles with weaver over numbers of things a normal occurence in the world of my favorite character on this show finally pa jeannie boulet gloria reuben my least favorite character in the 12 years this show has been on the air has to deal with her firing because of budget cuts she believes its because of her hiv status and sues for her job back which she gets her husband leaves for atlanta and she forms a bond with the son of anspaugh john aylward a young cancer patient i just never cared that much for this character mainly because i found her to be selfish in a lot of ways but maybe that 's just me this season featured a number of great guest stars including many who went on to star in shows in the future or came from past shows cullum northern exposure was great as mark greene 's father harold perrineau lost does a turn as the father of a critically injured boy george eads csi plays a paramedic with a thing for hathaway hargitay law and order svu is fantastic as cynthia the desk clerk sternhagen cheers is great as carter 's stoic grandmother jorja fox csi continues her recurring role as maggie doyle a number of great actors had spots on this show and this list is only a partial listing as for extras there are two features on the live episode including one that was filmed immediately after the two live episodes the other feature talks about the work that went into the live episode and how they pulled it off there is a gag reel and a number of deleted scenes as well since this is my favorite show i am bound to praise this set but anybody looking for quality television should look no further than this

a very successful comedy highly recommendable players are magnificent especially the final scene involving kevin cline 's dancing act is unforgettable enables people to overcome deeply rooted prejudices about sexual context fine trails in spectators ' brains
fun film about kevin kline as a teacher who discovers he 's gay and decides he must cancel his upcoming wedding scene with kevin kissing tom selleck acting as a newscaster is hillarious as well as the scene where kline is listening to tapes on how to act masculine a movie you will want to see more than once a film to add to your library of dvds
in greenleaf indiana something strange is happening everyone is turning gay or so it seems as a high school teacher is outted at the annual academy awards on national television the most surprised person is the teacher himself who was n't quite ready for such a bombshell to be dropped after all he is getting married or is he a hilarious comedy starring kevin kline joan cusack debbie reynolds wilford brimley matt dillon tom selleck and bob newhart this production is top notch all the way the cast is fantastic joan cusack gives a stellar performance as the jilted bride there 's not a dull moment and you will be totally enthrolled in the plot right from the start if you 'd rather not see tom selleck and kevin kline in a hot steamy kiss well get over it it 's hilarious terrific acting great plot very enjoyable to watch a great addition to your home video collection i highly recommend
kevin kline and joan cusak are excellent in this film that will make you laugh no doubt about it !
this was one of the best movies i have ever seen i love joan cusak and she was so fabulous in this movie i 've never paid much attention to tom selleck and this is the first time i have ever seen him without a mustache and he looks so gorgeous in this movie ! it was great got a little preachy at the end but the rest of the movie made that part worth it
i quite enjoyed watching this film which is why i give it four stars even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic so why did i like it joan cusack matt dillon kevin kline in that order and also a passably funny script at least one that is well structured for a viewing experience joan cusack is wonderful here her at her wayward fiance after he stands her up is fantastic and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street screaming is this the twilight zone '' at which point she collapses on the hood of matt dillon 's car in her wedding dress no less well that scene is adorable especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of shakespeare 's romeo and juliet a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity yes here is the heart of the film so i can not comprehend another viewer 's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film she 's obviously going to marry the movie star and get to eat cheetos into the bargain matt dillon is as ever the essence of cuteness and a much more desirable husband than kevin um i mean howard kevin kline does a decent job of mimicking howard a repressed gay man but it still feels like mimicking rather than acting here is also where the problems begin i guess wearing a means you are gay and similarly the barbra streisand gag is beaten to death and beyond how many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like barbra ! ! come on ! also kline 's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture not only is it not enough it 's really kind of humiliating nonetheless the final scene does give holland 's opus '' a run for its money and i ca n't deny it i did really have fun watching this movie it 's basically a sound little production well structured reasonably well written and kevin kline can dance
sitting down to watch this film a hige smile came across my face just about ten minutes in because once kevin klines charactor is outed by his now famous student kamden dillon the movie does n't let up i have n't seen a movie that kept me laughing so much in a very long time kevin kline plays a english lit professor who as i mentioned get 's outed by his former student while accepting an oscar for playing a gay charactor and so in the heat of the moment decided to dedicate the award to his professor and he 's gay '' and at that point hilarity ensues you see kevin kline is engaged to emily joan cusack in a scene stealing performance and they are due to be married in just two days so in those two days he needs to figure out if he 's really gay one surprising thing was tom sellick who does n't even look the same without his mustache he actually is much better looking and should keep it off tom plays a reporter who 's intent on getting kevin to out himself admitt to himself that he is really gay and all the while poor emily is n't sure if there is even going to be a wedding the movie is great from start to finish and it does touch on some deeper subjects along the line of gay tollerance and acceptance in our society when kamden outs his professor you get irritated when the priciple played perfectly by bob newhart ! ! ! warns him that if he does n't get married he 'll lose his job it 's sad to see the way our society will treat something they do n't agree with all in all this is as the tagline states an out in out comedy and an out in out good time
talk about comedy the performance of kevin kline was terrific but the supporting actors really deserve rave reviews joan cusak debbie reynolds wilford brimley and tom selleck were outstanding
this one of the early gay plot films i like it because it is light i really like the main characters kline selleck and cusack make a great ensemble
this movie was very helpful in finding the facts yet it also provided information about the fiction both sides were fairly represented while also letting the viewer know when real factual evidence was available and when it was n't not all of my questions were answered but that is just history for you the questions that could be answered were in this movie and those left unanswered showed both sides to the story would recommend this movie for those who are confused about the davinci code or who just want to learn a few things regarding the da vinci code
the first review was written by a high ranking official in the vatican seeking to keep the truth about the holy grail unknown
i have heard a lot of hoopla about dan brown 's fictional novel most of it is trash people claim that brown has opened the pandora 's box of christianity when in reality he has done nothing more than sway the fickle while reinforcing the beliefs of those who have done the thorough research interestingly history channel 's documentary about brown 's fictional novel is quite enlightening having read material from those involved in the jesus seminar i feel that they are nothing more than a bunch of quacks yet the people that took part in and gained fame from the jesus seminar are quite genius here is a group of people that have successfully made millions of dollars because of speculation in fact sir arthur conan doyle and agatha christie together could not have written better speculative fiction of course the documentary shines a lot of light on this otherwise dark bit of first the documentary discusses the various possibilities '' of the historical jesus they take several books from brown 's cited list which is located at the back of his book and explore the possibility of their being true each book that brown has cited and sticks by is nothing more than fickle assumptions based upon skewed views and beliefs while i am not against speculation because hypotheses push for research and discovery i am against presenting something as truth when there is no real evidence even one of the authors of holy blood holy grail makes an appearance of the history channel 's doc what does he have to say about his own novel he basically says that his books does not prove anything all he is attempting to convey is the possibility that there could be a jesus royal blood line to sum up the documentary the history channel does an excellent job of exposing the pure speculation of dan brown and all others involved in accusing christians for not seeing the true '' historical jesus while there are some questions that historians still need answer as with anything that is ancient jesus still stands the test of time firmly i was surprised by history channel 's position to repute the claims of dan brown and the jesus seminar but they do and very well too take the time to sit and watch this great documentary if you are unsure skeptical or scared about what dan brown 's novel has to say about christianity you will not be let down
this documentary is a very interesting work about de controvertial ideas over the ocidental history wich we can find in books like holy blood holy grail '' and of course the da vinci code ''
watching samurai champloo is at times an uneven experience watanabe brings his audience exactly what they expect quality the music is a stellar mix of traditional japanese folk songs and beats the art is beautiful and the story line is engaging the characters are interesting and fully developed by the conclusion of the series in certain ways watanabe has improved on cowboy bebop samurai champloo leaves no gaps in the lives of the characters or the motives behind their actions watanabe fleshes out the story line completely and evenly the journey of fuu jin and mugen moves steadily and the conclusion lasts three episodes the most important segments of the show take place over more than one episode and have a much more prolonged affect and unlike cowboy bebop samurai champloo effectively introduces elements of past history into its story line the satsuma rebellion and the tale of for example however samurai champloo suffers from overflow no anime in recent memort has provided its audience with side characters of such depth the villians and friends they meet on their journey feel as real and as significant as fuu jin and mugen but there is simply too many of them and they occupy too many episodes episodes such as baseball blues '' cosmic collisions '' art of altercation '' beat box bandits '' and war of words '' have too many eccentric characters and are not relevant to the story they are single episode stories that drag down the flow of progress a single season show should n't feel like it has filler episodes to reach 23 weeks of airplay in certain cases these provide great entertainment my favorite episode happens to be a single episode story gamblers and gallantry '' but more often than not the audience may feel like the series is dragging on with extra filler adventures that affect neither the three main characters or the audience to any great degree despite this weakness i do highly recommend the show watanabe does not let his creativity become a distraction nor does he let his refreshing take on the samurai '' become a gimmick watanabe nails all the core elements of story telling and animation on the head just be prepared to watch some filler before you get to the meat as a not pass up misguided miscreants '' and elegy of entrapment '' they are the highlights of watanabe 's work in any show
wow so i loved this series in the original japanese but after watching some of the dubs i have to say bang zoom entertainment did a pretty job getting the essence of the series down i think the chosen voice actors fit the characters really well and that it did n't seem cheaply done or overdone in any way that 's really hard to get down i think and as i fan of subs only most of the time i ca n't help but commend bang zoom for the work they did on this title i approve
i 'm not big on anime but watching one episode got me hooked the voices the animation the story the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch samurai champloo each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more
come and get it ! samurai champloo kung faux are building bridges between hip hop asian pop culture are you ready to cross it
samurai champloo has to be one of the best new anime series i 've seen in the past few years the characters are a bit predictable mugen and jin being the samurai equivalent of the odd couple and fuu as the always expected damsel in distress but the plot and over storyline is what makes this great the and soundtrack is well done unfortunately the soundtrack seems to be missing numerous tracks i was someone disappointed after purchasing it for anyone who followed cowboy bebop i think this series will definitely win you over as well shinichiro watanabe defintely left his mark with this series i can highly recommend this for anyone who enjoyed cowboy bebop or is looking for something refreshingly new
in my opinion this is one of the best manga series i have ever seen because it 's a very good story that mixture samurais with culture and it 's also very funny the caracters are very good i think mugen is the most important the bad guy but my favorite is jin and i think that he is the most powerfull in my opinion he would win the battle with mugen but that is only wath i think we would never know the girl is very funny and the mane reason of the sotyr afterall this is a must the only reason i gave stars is that the series is too long and some episides are not that good but the end is incredible and episode that mugen fights a guy that uses ki is also very good one of my favorite series very worth it and very funny
wow ! that 's one word that comes to mind wow ! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air their has not been any anime shows that have interested me for years i searched never finding anything worth watching then i sort of gave up i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail then one night it happened i saw the second episode of samurai champloo air on adult swim at first i wasnt paying attention to the words and action i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels the animation ! the artwork was incredible ! the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real it was almost as if it was a sitcom with real people only tis was completly animated it was ! then i started to watch the show itself and the show was great ! ! ! anyway since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes but alas the last one number seven comes out this month on the the show is coming to an end so anyway im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them i rated volume one of samurai champloo below episode one tempestuous jin mugen and fuu meet for the first time mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three bad asses '' and sends some cowards to go get them mugen however does not know that jin has killed them already mugen mistakes jin as one of the bad asses '' and attatcks him a brilliant fight insues and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together i rate episode one a episode two redeye mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one in this episode the man is out for revenge the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen also jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him another great fight and last of all our modest cough fuu gets smashed i rate this episode episodes 3 4 hellhounds for hire part one and the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house i give both episodes 3 4 thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes i will say this they are really expensive but they are worth the money i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not i reccomend you buy it i can personally vouch for this dvd of course its always good to check other reviews by different people as well later i hope this review helped
this has to be one of the coolest animes ever made with the director of cowboy beebop the creators of the series have turned history on its head as we join mugen jin and fuu on their road trip in japan mugen with his rough and ready back street fighting skills and jin with his uncompromising elegant swordsmanship help the young waitress in her journey to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers '' in return for her saving them from execution while also trying to find enough food to eat along the way the most impressive aspect of this series as a whole is in its ability to change from storylines to extremely funny episodes this anime shows us a totally different historical japan one that has the walking dead baseball and nude paintings however it grounds itself by also showing us the emotional background stories of the characters and the people they meet along the way you really never ever know what to expect from one episode to the next so the series is always fresh and never gets boring the animation is very good and the creators have put a lot of effort to ensure their characters have detailed facial expressions the voice acting is with mugen 's attitude coming across brilliantly and the music is good i love the song on the ending credits however the opening tune takes a bit of getting used to this is on of the top animes out at the moment and deserves to match the success of cowboy beebop
if you are bored with kurosawa 's faithful decpition of historical samurai and who would be if you think the samurai genre has been overused and outdated then get ready for the remix version of the age old genre samurai champloo directed by shinichiro watanabe the man who brought us cowboy bebop and 2 shorts in animatrix with character design by kazuto nakazawa kill bill vol 1 fame we are treated to a world that would have made the clan feel right at home the action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other one follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play the music is all modern no moody asian flare here the story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across japan in search of a samurai who 's only distinquishing characteristic is that he smells like sunflowers '' lack of money food and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky in this rated the equivilent of r in the us for bloody violence and language a must for any samurai genre fan
i love anime but lots of it can not hold my attention full metal alchemist and inuyasha are dead boring but this anime is probably the best ever tied with bebop this is a stylish combination of breakdancing and an akira kurosawa type movie very nic
very entertaining ! except few scenes i really enjoyed this movie but hey nothing is perfect right except maybe lotr you should buy this dvd or at least rent it watched and then decide i watched it few times and i will more in the future ! good romantic comedy !
i am really glad i bought this movie i had the vhs but the quality is much better with the dvd especially widescreen
bend it like beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls the film sensitively portrays a young indian girl 's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being the film is enjoyable on several levels 1 there is the cultural clash between britons of various descent 2 there is the hilarious lesbian '' mixup and 3 the pure sports film all in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people
very cute movie and a lot more fun than i thought it would be set in britain you have jess a teenage girl of indian descent keenly interested in playing soccer or football in britain and very good at soccer as well ! she idolizes british soccer player david beckham and dreams of one day becoming a professional player herself ! unfortunately her parents are very traditional and do n't want her playing soccer as girls of her age should no longer be interested in playing sports jess secretly joins a girl 's soccer team after being spotted by another female soccer player juliet who helps recruit jesse to play for her team jess 's parents do n't approve but jess decides to play on the team anyway and not tell her parents anything about being on the team jess excels at playing soccer enjoys playing soccer as it is her passion and becomes fast friends with the girls on her team as well as her coach she also does a lot of funny things in order not to be caught playing on an all girl 's soccer team by her parents but still gets caught anyway it does n't help that the coach for the team is a male ! pros cute funny movie with great storyline about friendship family love and finding the inner strength be fight for what you believe in and following your dream cons predictable hard at times to follow the british accents and british slang
parminder is a remarkable british punjaban who 's more in love with football than the frivolity of her culture ! she 's a character that perhaps most desi girls will relate to her drive to do her best at what she aspires the most is what takes a mere sport to turn into her life 's biggest opportunity ! her mom dad could easily pass off to be mine haa haa such is the close resemblance of character ! gurinder 's best work to date
bend it like beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you this is a smart funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for i urge every mother to give her daughter this dvd for a birthday christmas or graduation gift i think they 'll thank you for it bend it like beckham follows jess a young british girl of indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol david beckham she strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional indian parents who want her to conform to traditional indian culture i love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family she perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream there are a lot of funny moments in this movie i do n't want to give too much away this movie is too good to spoil i love this movie this is how movies should be made the cinematography in this movie is amazing the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen the entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about look for keira knightley in a supporting role a shawn james five star essential movie definitely get this movie along with the wonderful muriel 's wedding a great australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey
this movie was very great i enjoy indian show but usually find them to be to long this show added just the right amount of culture to it it explores the friendship of two girls of opposite races and shows that people are just that people now matter what class race or sex you are they also portrayed woman as strong and independent i liked that
bend it like beckham was a very enjoyable movie to watch it was inspirational and for young girls with a dream in showing that you can be anything that you want if you work hard enough jonathan rhys meyers was great in the role of the coach parminder nagra showed a wide range in her acting abilities considering this is one of her first films keira knightley sparkled in her role as a tomboy with a homophobic mother bringing just the right amount of humor to the film it was an all around sweet yet touching film examining the influence of culture in a young girl 's life the film poked fun at the proper life of a young indian girl growing up in a traditional household without getting too serious the costumes were rich in color and the soccer scenes were well filmed without looking fake all around bend it like beckham was an enjoyable and sweet romantic comedy it 's definitely worth the watch
warren beatty raps out the best work of his career both in front of the camera as senator jay bulworth and behind it as the film 's director bulworth is hilarious politically incorrect and tells truths that come in the form of shocking interviews and also in the form of a manic phase that delivers his message halle berry is at her hottest most mysterious and intriguing the streetwise kids in the ghetto almost steal the show and a jumping soundtrack pops the movie right off the screen there are a few movies that display so much insider acumen wag the dog '' primary colors '' and thank you for smoking '' come immediately to mind bulworth is in an elite satirical league that could include fear and loathing in las vegas '' but to be more accurate it is in a tradition dating back several centuries that includes greats like swift voltaire shaw and even george orwell
when this film came out most reviews were respectful but most of them really missed it beatty plays a liberal senator who is being told by idiotic overpaid consultants to move to the middle '' and be centrist '' these were just code words for agree with the republicans on everything be nice to them tell them they 're wonderful and tell the liberals in your party to go f k '' bulworth was being instructed to sell out all of his principles and sound like well he hires a hit man to kill him and this makes him start speaking the truth then he becomes a liberal again beatty saw through all that third way triangulation '' crap that bill clinton hillary clinton joe lieberman and james carville to name a few was pushing essentially the democratic party told its base to go to hell to be more moderate '' to reach out '' to the republicans to be bipartisan '' but when you look at bill clinton 's record he was as conservative as bush senior especially on economic issues all those were code words for making the democrats act just like the republicans it was bs back in 1996 and it 's bs now the dems bought it hook line and sinker and it alienated their base if they had been a little more like bulworth they may have held onto congress beatty is a hardcore unapologetic liberal who thinks that government can do good for working class people and he infuses this film with that message whether you agree with him or not the film works very well only now do the dems and the left wing blogs see through the lies that clinton and his ilk told them well beatty was tellin ' ya that in 1996
please watch this movie as one who recalls the night of the shooting of bobby kennedy and the death of all and any hope this movie which opens with bulworth viewing his wall of rfk mlk and minister x this movie says it all right up to the shattering but inevitable ending it carefully and clearly lays out the issues in many ways visually and verbally listen carefully to halle 's character 's analysis no matter how quickly it is spoken and see her hopelessness briefly relieved by bulworth as also the excellenty cheadle 's character try this as a double feature with bob roberts and be afraid very afraid at what we see now in dc
i like this movie a r for persuive strong language and drug and dvd rating
if for nothing else this film has one of the most memorable lines that you will ever hear in a movie bullworth is being interviewed and he comes up with a plan for racial deconstruction '' you can read it in full on the imdb website as the language is coarse the film does raise interesting points for conversations regarding race and equity and these are issues that we are going to be facing for some time thus the movie will continue to have relevance fortunate that the movie was made unfortunate that we still have problems in this world based soley on the color of someone 's skin
bulworth explores the term politically incorrect '' with uproarious results beatty takes chances satirizing hypocrisy and insincerity within our political system but the gamble pays off with a zany film that has something to say not for all tastes
imagine turning on the tv news cbs abc nbc cnn fox msnbc and hearing politicians actually speaking their minds and being absolutely brutally honest instead of saying what they 're scripted paid obligated to say ! imagine the lobbyists and official handlers dropping dead from massive coronaries ! bulworth is the sort of movie that makes you wish that all politicians were human rather than ideological automatons we are so bombarded brainwashed from both right and left that we take sides rather than balance them out ! warren beatty is a liberal guy however this movie is hardly leftist propoganda ! it is a cold slap in the face of politics itself an indictment of a rancid system based on lies and dirty deals a system fueled by billions of left and right wing dollars seeking only to maintain the comfortable positions of it 's members bulworth takes aim and the whole bloody mess ! imagine a world where politicians spoke from their hearts imagine them doing their true social duties while working for a living ! in bulworth it takes a total nervous breakdown for his epiphany if only real politicians had such breakdowns ! i highly recommend this movie but leave your liberal conservative bias ' out of it ! they will only cloud things up ! this movie would be a fantastic double feature with wag the dog ! enjoy
this movie is the quintessential example of how politics and public opinion rules the day each of the actors in this criminal injustice movie are compelling cusack 's plight is what endears him to the viewer restive in nature the louisiana boy attempts to save pacino 's administration and future but is unable to resurrect him in the end while pacino is resolute in his hopes dreams and desires his role as the greek mayor of new york city is plagued with a plethora of problems that he can no longer control his prior associations for good or bad is what is his final waterloo this film is resplendent in its depiction of police and political depravity this is a must see film for political science and criminal justice students most respectfully charles thomas kelly assistant professor of the administration of justice louisiana state
a complicated story line john cusack is new to me a performance that only falters in the last stages of the film john cobb austin tx has said in his review i am not a big pacino fan feeling he only plays one character well and that one i 'm way past tired '' i see what he means the set characters and set pieces down to the set music grow increasingly hollow to the point that you wonder if pacino was intending to sound hollow this film should not work yet by the end you have been drawn into it you have seen something not great but unusual and magnetic you watch the credits feeling sombre you hope that on one will talk to you for a while
i watched the entire movie with my mouth open glued to the screen well almost SMILE i have never before and not afterwards found a movie that was quite as good as this one in terms of captivation plot and the idea the story sucks you in and your brain is working the entire movie trying to figure out exactly what 's going on on my first take i did n't quite get the outcome so it took me some time and watching it again to really figure it out the basic plot is about a guy who has an disability where he does not remember immediate past events the story progress backwards ! from the end and this technique makes you see the main character 's predicament except we as the viewer see the 'future ' and know what will happen to him next i thought the actors were great the director did a great job and to quit raving about this movie i have to say that it 's simply superb watch it and you wo n't be dissapointed
memento '' eclipses everything which preceded it and set the bar so high it may never be topped and all for 5 million in production costs director nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes i refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by guy pearce and joe pantoliano converse over soup given that the film was shot in panavision 's anamorphic process the scene would have played more effectively if nolan had simply planted his camera for a medium shot of two skillful actors as they provided plot exposition instead nolan intercuts between close ups of the two which is a method more typical of and appropriate for the narrower aspect ratio of television close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis i mention this only because this is how detailed i have to go in order to find fault with the film if i did n't know better i would swear that pearce is an american actor his accent is that authentic all of the performances are convincing and it 's always fun to see eve 6 '' harriet sansom harris from that great '' episode this film is proof of the morally bankrupt notion that movies have to cost 200 miilion or more i am sick of ugly witless loud blockbusters which are polluting pop culture if the choice is to spend that sort of money making a movie or allow the movie to go unmade '' now where was i
memento is the ultimate whodunit mixed with conundrums it swallows up the competition in this department but maybe that is because it 's near overload forward back steps back one step forward after a while it feels like i 'm watching jeopardy ! i 'm always getting the answers and finding out how they turned out that way can end up being half the fun the movie centers on a man named leonard guy pearce who is trying to put together clues to figure out what is happening to him his last real memory is of his wife dying at the hands of an unknown assailant the movie starts out showing us leonard in a motel room going over various notes and messages he has written to himself on pieces of paper his hands and various polaroid pictures he has taken leonard seems to have his memory reset '' after every 17 minutes or so the result of this memory loss comes from the accident that took place when he tried to stop his wife 's assailant memento is one you really have to pay attention to and i 'm not kidding however you 'll catch on to the pattern after a while which makes it even more fun the show will jump back and forth to show leonard in various stages and then show us how he actually got there why he wrote down what he did and if he is in fact coming closer to getting an answer paranoia seems to set into the theme well as we the viewers can never be sure who to trust let alone wonder if what leonard is writing down will lead to his success or ultimate demise the facts '' that he gathers are tattooed onto his body with a bic pen and a needle kids do n't try this in study hall along the way there are two other characters that are with him in his dealings of these issues one is a guy named teddy joe pantoliano who may be a hood or a cop or neither the other is natalie moss who seems to be in her own troubles deep enough and yet is somehow connected with leonard as far as independent or contemporary '' filmmaking goes this thing is a masterpiece tight script in depth plot not muddled by tons of extras effects and poor dialogue what you have is an amazing trip '' wrapped up in a puzzle inside a okay you get the picture no pun intended i 'm glad i remembered again no pun intended to give this movie another chance after my initial 17 minute viewing of it whereupon i turned it off or did i just forget how it began again no pun memento was written and directed by christopher nolan and released in 2000
this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old
memento '' is a masterpiece of suspense i highly recommend this film to all viewers guy pearce portrays leonard shelby a former insurance agent who is trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife the problem is that leonard has memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked therefore as a result the character leonard shelby does not have the capability to remember anything within the last 10 minutes whenever leonard has a conversion or reads something he must write it down or tape it or he will forget to do this he resorts to photographing people he meets and tattooing his body in order for him to remember the most important information which he feels will help him find his wife 's killer the interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order joe pantoliano portrays the character teddy and where teddy 's loyalties lie leave the viewer in suspense the entire movie is a masterpiece in and it is thoroughly worth the watch i highly recommend this movie to all viewers
awesome movie nolan is a genius thriller that changes your reaction since it 's told in reverse
memento is a movie you have to watch again to fully understand the roots of the story behind lenard shelby guy pierce and his relationships with natalie moss gamel joe pantoliano lenard has a condition in this movie where he has no memory not amnesia though he can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he to remember and for the important things he has them tattooed on his own body he is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture wo n't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested of teddy shot in the head but you do n't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in minute sequences then moving into sequences where lenard talks more about his condition be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it overall great movie
junto con un wtf ! '' fue lo que dije cuando abri el paquete con los su estuche en particular se parece mucho a una de esas carpetas de informes medicos en donde tanbien trae los informes del paciente o que eso no fue al poner el dvd fue lo frito que habia o ver para estaba mas perdido que quien sabe y el segundo dvd fue peor es mas complejo de igual forma tuve que buscarme unas guias de como ver el dvd y poder todas las cosas que la pelicula es muy y la version de la pelicula que trae el segundo dvd tambien es muy curiosa
tyler perry has done it again as usual this was very funny the music performances were on point
i love tyler perry plays and movies he writes comical dramas his plays are humorous but there is always a lesson to be learned in them his characters are well developed and you feel like you know them as neighbors
this is life pure and joys pains glories and heartaches with god being the focal point in everything that happen
i found this play quite entertaining the 'old school ' values that madea offered were attractively packaged in her wit and contagious humor i gave it 4 stars though because at times the dialogue at the beginning was too fast and i lost some of it i also found that parts of the play were too it seemed to lose momentum generally speaking though a good worthwhile performance
i love to watch the madea plays they are so funny but yet still send out a message to people this play was funny all the way my favorite line off the whole play was hello can i speak to scooby doo '' this was a great play tyler perry doin the thing they should make a movie off of this play hopefully they will
this play is the best i love it i knew that it would be funny becuase tyler perry is just an funny guy i love all of his plays this play is one of the best all of his plays are the best but this one is the funniest madea is a trip in this one i never seen this untill recently i 've seen all of his others one and they were off the chain and this is just grea
i laughed so hard that tears came out of my eyes while watching this i forgot that there is a man underneath the madear is worth buying
once again tyler perry had me cracking up but his message was right on
i never seen a tyler perry play or dvd until i seen i can do bad all by myself '' dvd and this is very funny and good and the funnier thing is tyler perry gets straight to your and you 're into this and laughing your ass off until you relize thru this wonderful comedy it 's a christian by then reguardless of your spirituality you 're into it for what it is a funny ass play period ! i highly recommend this dvd for a great night of laughs just do n't invite brown over for i
i loved this play tyler perry and his ability to make you laugh and cry is a blessing from god you can watch this with everyone in your family
i watched all of these shows as a child i still enjoy watching them just as much as i did back then i 've never heard my grandkids laugh so much great fun for the whole family ! ! !
okay we 've had the racism discussion ironic since there is no racial humor in the films in this particular set back to rascalism and the contents of these films fly my kite is a nice 1931 entry sure the plot about the gang helping an old lady fight off being eviced by her heartless son in law is hackneyed but the gang 's personalities keep things entertaining hook and ladder '' is a pretty funny remake of the 1926 rascal classic the fourth alarm and sound adds to the humor hee the gang fights a fire and saves the day the first round up '' is an amusing tale of the gang on a camping trip that goes all wrong in the words of scotty beckett they 'll never learn '' the last shot of petey 's eyes going buck wild is worth the price of admission ! teacher 's beau '' stymie 's film establishes the spanky and alfalfa team that would carry the series to its final years and they do quite well as they try to stop their teacher from getting married look fast for a young dorothy dandridge reunion in rhythm '' was filmed around the older kids mickey daniels mary kornman joe cobb and matthew stymie '' beard returning for the gang 's anniversary and they breifly interact with their successors spanky buckwheat et al as the smaller fry do a school play but enough of this just get it and enjoy beginner 's luck is classic on the floor funny rascalism spanky 's mother forces him to enter a talent show and she get her comeuppance and how ! alfalfa makes a hilarious debut and the five cabin kids a popular black vocal group of children jazz things up with their rnedition of dinah '' check out the little guy 's louis armstrong impression
the job they did cleaning this up is great ! the sound is low yet clear the picture is clear without alot of floaters '' in as old as this reel is it 's in awesome shape ! my kids love it as much as i ever did
i grew up watching the old of the little rascals in the and watching those shows are some of my most vivid childhood memories in retrospect why ca n't viewers accept the fact that this show featured good clean innocent childhood fun and yet also had some racist undertones consistent with the times to say this show was n't groundbreaking and hilarious is to ignore the facts but to say that this show looking back did n't have some racist undertones is also to ignore the facts look at a large portion of the black community in the refused to watch this program because of its overtly racist undertones and yet a lot of those same people will admit today that it 's hard not to laugh at some of the humor you just have to be honest and be real when watching old footage of hollywood shows like these i 'll continue to laugh when i watch these episodes but in adulthood it 's hard not to also think back to what living in the and was like for my family it was n't always all fun and games and no doubt we all know that tv hollywood images have proven to be equally empowering damaging for a number of reasons little rascals should serve as the ultimate history lesson great writing great comedy are timeless this kind of racism no matter how blatant or hidden is dated these dvds attest to that
for black history month could n't help sounding off about the ridiculous charges made in reviews here of the little rascals '' being racist quite the opposite fare such as the little rascals '' depicting black and white children playing together were extremely provocative in the racist south during the civil rights era children 's book publishers caught it so heavily from both sides blacks protesting the depiction of their race in books and segregationalist whites protesting any suggestion of racial mixing that people of color disappeared from children 's literature entirely for a time see the article here http when they reemerged in the late it was cautiously it seems a heavily pc agenda is still in force and seeking to rewrite history
after making some major amazon purchases this week i noticed one thing most of my purchases had in common there was always someone posting negative reviews based on looking at all of these videos from a racial '' perspective there are people out there who would deter you from buying heart warming '' videos like these just because they are searching for a crusade this is my attempt to place a review here i spent so much time on my one that i couldnt even attempt to go into that detail again do n't have the time so i will be brief in short these are charming films that will make you laugh and remind you of what being a kid was all about in a simpler time this series and something as innocent as the our rascals '' series are american popular cultural treasures ! never ceases to amaze me how some people go out of their way '' to look for racism these people keep agitating try to keep things stirred up how many posts have i read this week in this vein the black man is still oppressed by the white man lets ' remember why we are here to buy videos not rehash tired old stereotypes some reviewers are looking for a platform an audience to preach to they do it on these reviews and ruin this forum in the process something tells me they were indoctrinated into the victim mentality and are brainwashed into believing that they can not succeed in life some self proclaimed black leaders make a living doing this please disregard all of those rediculous posts take my advice and buy this series you will not be disappointed !
i grew up watching the little rascals and adore this video i am far from ignorant and will defend these videos till the end racism what the hell are they talking about our gang comedies were way ahead of their time the fact that we are discussing them still some 75 years later is proof positive stymie buckwheat and farina are staples to the series long before god forbid i say black were in any tv shows tell me where are the characters in gilligan 's island bewitched andy griffith my three sons lost in space petticoat junction green acres charlie 's angels etc or even as recent as seinfeld cheers what is wrong with you people these are great shows absolute classics the problem with people today as that they do n't know how to laugh at themselves trust me even if you have never seen the little rascals this video is worth every penny and then some
i am looking forward to all the racial slurs in the future releases not only are they hilarious it shows how bad things were and how attitudes have drastically changed in favor of the politically correct viewpoint no racism is n't gone guess what never will be but it is so cool to see television before politically correct sensorship strangled the creativity and time stamp '' quality that is televisions greatest asset
would you believe i never watched it before this week i 've missed a lot of classics which i should have seen so how did this one age quite nicely fine writing laugh out loud funny situational comedy many supporting actors and actresses who i recognized from elsewhere funny hair clever satire solid content garishly colorful clothes you have to love laughing at at last i understand why simon and garfunkel who i like are so overrated anne bancroft immediately became every schoolboy 's fantasy and dustin hoffman was brilliant in the starring role i chose not to have sex as a teenager or a but seeing hoffman as a recent university graduate all i could think was damn that kid needs to get laid '' even after he got laid great movie
you will want to buy this movie once you have see madea 's family reunion
this reviewer has recently been on a film fest of my own watching the minnesota branch of the graduate 's the heartbreak kid foolin ' around and decided it was high time to revisit their roots i 'm glad i did the graduate is still prime boomer comfort and soul food and i learned a lot from the extras on this special edition '' for instance dustin hoffman as benjamin and director mike nichols are attempting some grandiose jesuschrist superstar oops ! wrong movie SMILE symbolism when ben is pounding on the upstairs window in the church it was a pragmatic solution to the real parish pastor 's concern that they were gon na break his beautiful bequested glass if continued pounding on it like he had at rehersals better to disperse the pressure ! all in all still fantastic after all these years ! amazon reviewer
i can remember sitting through back to back showings of graduate ' in a now defunct whittier theater when it was originally released in i was a sophomore in high school at the time and as i remember there were several reasons why i put in the extra time to sit through a second viewing one reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper lainie miller perform again hey i was sixteen raging hormones you know the story anyway that was one reason the other was because it was hilarious and there was so much laughing going on in the audience that i missed a lot of what was being said the first time i had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances of course that was how does graduate ' fair some 39 years later dustin hoffman is still delightful as the and somewhat awkward benjamin braddock while katherine ross remains as lovely as ever however with that said i must also admit that the film appears to have lost some of the comedic charm and emotional pathos it once possessed maybe it 's not the film maybe with the passing of years i 've simply lost my connection with that sixties angst this movie so perfectly reflects sadly even the simon garfunkel soundtrack that so enthralled me when i was a teenager now seems somewhat out of place and dated i quess what i 'm trying to convey is 'the graduate ' may not be quite the classic i once thought it was but it does n't miss by much i would still consider it to be one of the most memorable films of the sixties
the graduate is both hilarious and resonant dressing the very real and consuming anxiety of young adulthood in the trappings of must be noted as well that our culture would be much poorer without the graduate bancroft 's robinson has become an icon of mature sexuality aided in great part by the iconic nostalgic simon and garfunkel song that shares her graduate is in many ways a fortuitous result of divine synergy and timing with hoffman bucking stereotypes to win the role and nichols at the top of his film is a visual textbook for filmmakers
the graduate has become a classic film one that makes all those 100 film ' lists it stars a young dustin hoffman as benjamin braddock a young man from a wealthy family who has just graduated from college he is in limbo unsure of what to do with his time and where life will lead him the robinson 's are his parents ' best friends and it is their daughter elaine katharine ross who ben 's parents have earmarked as a partner for their son however mrs robinson played by a brilliantly predatory anne bancroft has other plans and is set on seducing the young man when elaine returns from college ben falls for her and ends his relationship with her mother predictably mrs robinson reacts with hostility and sets out to ruin both his relationship with her daughter and his life simon and garfunkle provide the music in their inimitable style and the title song mrs robinson was a huge hit for them director mike nichols managed in this film to capture the feel and mood of the 60 's flawlessly and he deservedly won an oscar for his work the dvd itself has few extras a documentary by the director interview with hoffman some trailers and the usual subtitles the picture and sound quality are good what you would expect from the format this is a film that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching today
james you wrote ben is weak immature a stalker lazy has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends wow ! revolutionary not ! '' yes ben was weak immature and had bad taste in women his learning to overcome his weakness immaturity bad taste in women and then defy his family and elaine 's family was his coming of age story that was the point of the movie it went right over your head ! the acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out ! how could you not love this movie maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value watch it again in a few years i think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time
i saw this movie as a child and it simply stole my breath away ! this is from the age of great movie making in hollywood ! black and white makes it even more dynamic ! considering that the major actors are not really chinese but made chinese by clever makeup it is even more amazing they make their characters come alive and real ! the story of a poor farmer living with his father the story takes you from his wedding to a slave to his rise as a rich landlord the journey is the thing ! the slave he marries is meek on the outside but strong inside she even goes out during labor to help save their wheat crop from the coming hailstorm ! and it is done with reality although for its time the special effects are amazing and devestating a famine comes and they must kill and eat their beloved ox it is the woman who can only kill their beloved friend so they can survive when someone offers pitance for their land the woman kills her newborn child so they can keep the land and go to the city for a while to survive it is the woman who finds a bag of jewels that propels them to a life of riches there is a lot of happiness heartache and truth in this movie it will not disappoint outstanding performances ! !
there were only chinese in the background just like in memoirs of a geisha the actresses or at least the main ones where chinese instead of japanese the actors and actresses in the good earth where not chinese either i certainly cried foul when in memoirs of a geisha chinese actresses where asked to play japanese roles the actresses in memoirs of a geisha did not pull it off then and the good earth 's stars paul muni and luise rainer did not pull it off either sorry now would the role of have been better played by anna may wong is arguable as a chinese american she was removed from here chinese ethnic roots or was she nevertheless the point is there were only chinese people in the background paul muni plays wang lung a peasant chinese farmer conversely luise rainer is his once slave now wife this cinematic adaptation of the pearl buck novel which is arguably the source of the problem has wang lung and trying to make their way in what is an epic battle against poverty nature and a whole host of other impediments like their own personalities starting from scratch and building their land holdings up from nothing then as the famine hit losing everything the family moves south only to slum it on the streets of the city the perennial luck bringer finds a cache of jewels during a riot in which she was almost killed herself she and wang lung become the landlords once again wang lung sets up a stereotype of the disloyal chinese fellow who hurts his wife deeply one who brought all the luck by engaging in a second younger wife to get biblical our protagonists using the skills gained by their young son battle against a plague of locusts and win ! predictably and it is all over the place there is a tone of inexcusable jingoism in the movie the good earth more a reflection of how we saw chinese rather than an authentic rendition of the chinese themselves muni and rainer who won an oscar for this role are miscast for the roles and particularly the minor characters many of whom are also played by do a terrible job of playing chinese they are all in caricature one could only give kudos to a movie like this if 1 one thought this was a wonderful rendition of what we think chinese are and 2 one has never been to china it is orientalism and should be seen as such miguel llor
a film classic excellent story and performances from all the stars perhaps the acting style is a little dated a very god qulaity transfer to dvd except for one scene that is a little grainy i will watch this film again and again
i read the book back in high school and thought it was amazing ! i 've always wanted to watch the movie and finally got it on dvd a week ago i never liked black and white movies but this movie was excellent because the pictures were very clear and the sound was excellent my only objection is that the movie left out lots of details that 's in the book but thumbs up anyway ! highly recommended
as an asian american i just want to say how well this movie is made i 'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors come on people this was in the ! ! and yes there are a few scenes that are not in the book but let 's count how many hollywood movies taken from books that ca n't hold a candle to it 's original masterpiece i love the movie 'misery ' but if you 've read the book the book outshines the movie by a landslide so yes the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book but still a very well made movie nonetheless particularly for the i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd
this movie exemplifies what was good and what was bad about hollywood in the 1930 's the good part was that they could take a major work of contemporary literature and convert it into a major motion picture the good was that they could create special effects like the swarm of locusts attacking the fields the good was that they could adhere to a code of standards that enabled them to suggest sexuality without showing it the good was that they could make a moral statement without hitting us over the head with it the bad was the fact that they used caucasian actors to play the leading oriental roles paul muni never came across as an oriental of any nationality and no amount of was going to make it happen luise rainer came off fairly believable but to have uncle henry from the wizard of oz '' playing the venerable father was too much the problem that hollywood had for years and to an extent even today was that they could n't seem to accept in leading roles orson welles plays othello peter lorre plays motto anthony quinn plays an eskimo in the savage innocents '' ricardo montalban plays a native american and in a bizarre twist so does woody strode ben kingsley plays gandhi and on and on and on i realize that the attitude is that a big name helps sell the movie but why not let an oriental play an oriental a native american play a native american i do n't think it was a lack of talent i suspect it was a lack of interest having made those points i would conclude by suggesting that the good earth '' is about minutes too long but it is otherwise a very good picture i believe that luise rainer was awarded the best actress oscar for her role as olin and i came away impressed that the award was well earned
the good earth '' must be considered a milestone movie '' as yet there is no dvd but one packed with about the making of this film would be especially welcome there was no oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939 otherwise the good earth '' would have 'taken home ' that award ! the lovely luise ranier did win best actress '' award the 1937 movie was based on pearl buck 's novel that won the pulitzer prize in 1932. interest in the good earth '' was revived in fall 2004 when it was selected for oprah 's book club '' perhaps women 's rights advocates should also give it a boost the story is about china in the a simple farmer wang lung is 'given ' by his father the slave for his bride i do not remember much from childhood about this film but i definitely do not recall paul muni having such a mouthful of teeth ! special effecrs ! luise ranier had won an oscar the previous year for her role in the ziegfield follies '' what a contrast ! here she is the completely docile loyal wife as someone wrote she was bound to her husband in eternal servitude '' and her devotion was betrayed partly through the machinations of uncle '' at every time of crisis in the story along comes groan ! the crafty manipulatve uncle walter connolly who whines wheedles inserting humor into the script and at the same time destroying family amity from the internet movie database are the prophetic words of former slave when i go back in that house it will be with my son in my arms i 'll have a red coat on him and red flower trousers and a hat with a gilded buddha and shoes and i 'll go into the kitchen where i spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe and i 'll show myself and my son to all of them '' smiles contented wang lung well now i i have n't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house '' is n't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago i found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing read susan wong 's wonderfully perceptive review on today 's do n't seem to care about true life '' documentation in films but animation could n't convince as the locusts do ! that tired word awesome '' truly fits this vintage film the choking drought famine the beautiful 'condensed ' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings reviewer mchaiku hails this film and others that made an impact on my childhood !
boy meets girl girl thinks boy is a little weird but interesting boy is mildly taken with girl they part with a classic kiss that screams spontaneity they meet again under circumstances that they ca n't have each other and the girl does n't know what she wants she 's just irritated by boy i wo n't ruin the ending but it 's a good one this has nudity in it my husband thinks i watch it to see julian sands in the buff he might be right
this has to be one of the best romantic movies ever filmed merchant and ivory were masters at period films the music acting locations costumes were first class one of my favorite movie scenes of all times is the playful scene of the vicar and the two young men frolicking buck naked in the pond in the woods i laugh out loud every time i see the movie there are so many brilliant moments in this movie i never tire of it i 've had the video for many years so i had to have the dvd
when i watched this film for the first time several years ago i thought it was boring now that i 've become a big fan of film adaptations and more important period pieces i thought it would be fair to give this film a second chance a room with a view is a beautiful passionate love story that keeps real to forster 's novel this is the story of lucy honeychurch helena and the choices she has to make should she choose her boring but socially approved cecil daniel or should she follow her heart and choose the adorable and passionate george julian sands whom she met during a trip to florence italy should she settle for the demands and social mores of edwardian england the story is and subtle it focuses more on the decisions lucy has to make some people may consider it boring i however think it is one of the best love stories out there the actors are all magnificent helena daniel and julian sands are wonderful the scenes where the men bathe naked at the lake is my favorite scene yes there is explicit male nudity in this scene but i like the fact that they show men frolicking in such an innocent way i thought it was endearing and the acting wonderful as for the rest of the cast judi dench and simon callow are also great the production is an eyeful the wardrobe sets scenery especially the scenes in italy and backdrop of the edwardian period this is not a victorian like other reviewers have said are breathtaking james ivory and the bbc went all the way with the quality of the direction and production this movie was released in 1986 and the dvd 's digital remastering is excellent it adds dimensions to this already beautiful film if you love classic love stories and you 're a period film enthusiast i recommend a room with a view only a true lover of the aforementioned things could appreciate this great film to the full
see title simply put it 's a charming film loved it a very successful gift
the was a banner time for forster fans two of his novels a passage to india '' and this a room with a view '' were successfully and wonderfully adapted for the big screen howard 's end '' would come a few years later forster had a genius for developing characters and for showing the awesome and sometime awful complexities that arise when people interract james ivory thanks to a brilliant casting director had the right actors to bring these characters to life on the screen helen bonham carter maggie smith simon callow julian sands daniel etc what this permitted ivory to do was to focus on another equally important element in film making to give us something beautiful to look at the shots of a small engish village the lusty italian countryside the polish of an upper class english garden are nothing short of breathtaking it enhances the romance heightens the humor especially when an english minister decides to skinny dip with a few parishoners in a hysterical scene and convinces us that this was how life was for these remarkable characters one of the 's best collaborations this dvd also comes with some insightful commentary and a unique look at forster 's life i recommend it highly
this is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time it 's funny and beautiful with a perfect cast the music and the scenery is breathtaking i agree with a previous reviewer i ca n't think of anything that is n't perfect with this film
this has always been a favorite movie of mine enchanting visually stunning and superb acting but i have to say i think that the digital remastering takes some of that enchantment away at least with the audio aspect actor 's voices have lost the human richness esp the women 's voices which sound higher pitched and slightly annoying even the music and sound effects sound a little off '' so it was sadly less of an enjoyable enchanting experience for me watching this version that said i still love this movie so i 'm giving it 4 stars minus 1 for the bad remastering but this is just my opinion so feel free to take it or leave it cheers
i love this movie for my birthday my mom ordered it for me SMILE the video store lost the order and it took them 6 months to get it to me on vhs does that tell you how long i have loved this movie ! ! ! i know the movie word for word ! ! most men do not understand it it has no action duh ! ! it does not need it ! it is beautifully written and the background italy etc is perfect ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have a wonderful dream to fufill on day to run through a barley poppy field dressed in a victorian dress and carring a parasol SMILE i love the way helena says the word constantinople it will be my daughter 's name also the costumes and hair in the movie is incredable ! ! for my wedding i had the hair of the italian driver 's girlfriend i am a long haired blond so it worked out perfectly helena still and always will be my favorite british actress this movie moved my in many ways and i even after almost 15 years nothing compares to this movie in my opinion ! ! enjoy ! ! ! ! if you are a romantic at heart let the romance take you away for a few hours
in my review of 'it 's alive ' i noted that that film was surprisingly serious and for a film about murderous mutant babies the same can not be said for these two movies however they 're highly entertaining so between the 3 of them we get a bit of everything this is some very entertaining schlock horror right here ca n't imagine why it is n't more popular 'it lives again ' is the better of the two here and probably the best of the series this is a direct sequel as the killer baby epidemic is spreading and the government has resorted to immediate execution frank davis is back with a number of sympathetic doctors and scientists and is working to save the children this time there are 3 babies and there is a whole lot more baby mayhem though they 're still occasionally conspicously absent from the frame you see a whole lot more of the kids this time around obviously they are rarely at all convincing but i think they look neat and seeing the babies maul someone is always a treat there 's still quite a bit of downtime but frank is still entertaining to watch so it does n't hurt it all too much he 's getting pretty obsessive and nutty by now but i still sympathize with him this time around the whole thing seems a lot wackier now they 've got whole legions of cops waiting for the babies and watching them search the hillside and lengthily discuss strategy is just very amusing the film is hurt by the fact that the ending is a bit to reiterative of the original seems a little lazy this way but it does n't matter too much grade b 'island of the alive ' is easily the weakest of the series but it 's still entertaining and deserves some credit for trying something new it starts michael moriarty as jarvis an actor who fathers a mutant child and fights to have them saved after a hilarious and awesome courtroom scene involving a animated baby it is decided that the killer babies will be banished to some jungle island the film focuses on a few years later where there is an expedition to see how the babies have grown this points to the central problem the babies are all grown up throughout the climax of the film so they 're basically just monster people that is much less appealing still there 's quite a bit of baby action at the beginning and it 's the best stuff of the series there 's a sequence where a pack of hired guns go out to wipe out the babies shortly after they 're placed on the island which is absolutley priceless culmnating in the final survivor fleeing in the helicopter only to find that dear god ! there 's a baby already inside which leaps on him from behind also then the helicopter explodes for no apparent reason as with all the cohen monster films i 've seen this movie has got a lotta talking focusing largely on moriarty 's wacky twitchy and crazy performance i find him fairly amusing but he 's definitely on display too much the film is also helped by a fair bit of gore but the overall relative absence of the babies reduces the charm of the film substantially grade yeah this disc is definitely worth at least a rental at this low of a price i 'm sure i 'll pick it up sooner or later actually but ya certainly oughta see it at least once
they 're cute ! they 're cuddly ! they 'll rip yer head off ! in it 's alive the davis baby ran crawled amok leaving bodies strewn in it 's frenzied wake ! larry cohen 's saga of babies gone bad continues with this double dose of pernicious pablum ! it lives again has frank davis john ryan crashing a baby shower to deliver the bad news that the expectant parents frederic forrest and kathleen lloyd are about to hear the of little feet ! if that 's not horrid enough the government is watching and waiting for it 's chance to swoop in and make things even worse ! mallory john '' marley leads a team of operatives bent on mutant infanticide frank must get the young couple into hiding at a secret facility before the inevitible bloodbath check out the on wheels ! slower than the original but good enough for repeat viewings island of the alive opens with the infamous delivery scene then we shift to a father named stephen jarvis michael winged serpent '' moriarty fighting in court for the life of his caged son the judge decides to spare the creature and an island is found where it and others of it 's kind can live in peace well of course invaders arrive to hunt down and kill the babies only to become so much baby food themselves ! finally another team is sent to study '' the lil ' devils who have all grown up into big ol ' cannibals ! mmmm ! it turns out that the kids '' have a plan of their own ! karen black trilogy of terror burnt offerings stars as jarvis ' ellen who just wants to forget the whole killer baby '' thing i love this one ! much gorier than the first two this is a great double feature ! grab the first one too and complete the trifecta
when watching the third x men movie one can not help but wonder if bryan singer was involved in the ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that singer defined the movie is loaded with great action sequences new characters plot twists and and at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements the phoenix and the death of a beloved and characters angel beast juggernaught rogue the endings leaves the door open for this not to be the last '' stand of the cinimatic adventure of the
in iii the last stand '' the government has found a 'cure ' for mutants and are more than happy to help make them normal humans of course mutants from both sides of the fence do not like the idea of becoming cured many do not see it as a disease of course magneto ian mckellen dose not like this idea and raises an army or rouge mutants to fight the government program meanwhile jane grey famke janssen is back though as psychotic phoenix xavier patrick stewart tries to help but is unable to reach her and wolverine hugh jackman has less luck and a tougher decision many loose ends are tied up and things conclude so i am inclined to think this may be the last movie though spin offs are more than likely this film had a darker edge to it due to it 's near idea of what the 'normal ' people are curing the action was really wild and great you 'll never be bored that 's for sure and it also gets you at the gut too as a few loved ones depart the acting is about what you 'd expect good for a huge cgi driven spectacle movie while wolverine is still the focus the cast is so large that he slightly gets pushed to the side often with new characters like beast jurganaught and angel just to name a few i like this film a lot it was a lot better than the other comic book movie this summer that 's for sure
xmen iii is one of the best movies ever ! ! the intense battle between the different philosophies of xavier and magneto is at its peak in the last xmen movie the last stand a tale of survival this movie emcompasses all genres such as politics action romance comedy drama horror etc this movie has something for everyone ! from the politics of the cure to the forced suppression of the dark pheonix of jean grey the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this movie not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity with the perfect combination of story telling and presentation one can understand both perspectives whether it is for xavier or magneto this movie is nothing but perfect
the third installment of the very successful mutant franchise ends with a very loud bang ! filled with more action and special effects that you could ever hope for no to mention all the mutants they could cram in 2 hours this was a very good movie if you can set aside the fact that it has no plot whatsoever xmen hardcore fans may be disappointed of the complete alteration of the phoenix saga and of the complete moron the juggernaut is turned into the good many incredible fights and battles beast rules ! the bad not a very interesting or profound plot juggernaut sucks !
a cure has been discovered to help mutants be normal if they chose it unfortunately it has made magneto ian mckellen furious as hell as he recruits some of his deadly mutants to put a stop to it jean grey famke janssen whom thought she was left for dead in the previous picture has been resurrected but filled with dark powers as the powerful and evil dark phoenix as she joins up with magneto to enslave humanity once and for all but can charles xavier patrick stewart along with the hugh jackman anna paquin halle berry shawn ashmore james marsden with three new members kitty pryd ellen page beast kelsey grammer and angel ben foster stop the war from happening this is the final installment of the popular '' trilogy the film is kind of weak compared to the awesome first two installments but there is plenty of good action sequences some humor more wolverine action emotion and new mutants like juggernaut vinnie jones as the director of rush hour '' brett ratner takes over bryan singer 's spot for director to take this final installment to a new direction it 's a weak but very good end to a great marvel comic movie series until a few character come along like wolverine '' and magneto '' this dvd has great picture sound with some good extras like two audio commentaries and deleted scenes it 's still worth owning if you loved the first two movies or comic based movies
if you enjoyed the old martha stewart living program then you will be happy to add this dvd to your repertoire it offers many different dishes and cuisines as you can tell from other reviews and it is fantastic to be able to relive these classic martha moments
martha martha martha ! ! ! well done our good friend ! ! this time she has invited some of the most and powerful chefs to join her and share their kitchen gems ! ! of course i would have loved for this to have been longer and with more video and recipes and such but how can i possibly complain it has the markings of martha quality and perfection that is her trademark and she has once again delivered some of the very best only this time she has shared the spotlight with some of the cooking greats ! there are 15 recipes that compromise 5 major cuisines which include american italian french mexican and asian and she has some of the top chefs within each joyful international fare to teach us with the assist of martha 's reputation of superb filming quality and perfection of delivery american ribs with bobby flank steak with tom new england clam chowder with jasper white italian spaghetti alla carbonara with mario spiedini alla romano with lida lemon chicken with frank pellegrino french cote de boeuf with daniel shrimp with orange dust with coq au vin with riad nasr mexican tamales with diana chiles anchos rellenos with roberto calamari with jose hurtado asian pad thai with pork buns with eileen hand rolls with nobu as per usual there is the ability to print recipes and instructions for all of these classic foods trying to pick a favorite is very difficult because there is a time and occasion for each of these gastronomic delights and it would be very weak to cry ignorance in knowing how to prepare any of them the joy or shall we say the secret of martha 's success lies in her knowledge that if you give all the steps and instructions to make something be it food or crafts or gardening the masses will return to you again and again and we do this dvd is no exception to her steadfast rule we are very grateful for her teaching style and this has become her hallmark she requires this of her guests as well and when it comes to cooking and baking it is essential if you want a following teach them well and with patience i was please to see that she went back into some of her earlier shows to bring up this menu of guest chefs and recipes to see a very young bobby flay and mario batali as well as the most elegant lidia bastianich she has even more treasures from her earlier shows which i hope she brings to dvd as well perhaps to buy as a series ah yes i digress i was trying to decide which was my favorite but that became impossible as each recipe had some aspect of desire that made it difficlt to decide the clam chowder was soooo very good but that is for my fall and winter settings for summer i rely on the pad thai with its slight kick of flavor to get us in the mood for sun and fun not to mention the superb shrimp with orange dust absolutely a must ! ! ! and if you need something just a wee bit special for dinner go with the flank steak because it is as beautiful to serve as it is to eat this is a definite top ten martha enjoy ! !
after the intensity of zoo tv and the seeking of pop mart the elevation tour was a big hug and a kiss from the boys from ireland this is at their spiritual musical and interactive heights from the loving interaction between the band members to the obvious delight of the fans this dvd captures a magical experience each tour from is a gift and this dvd is an excellent way to remember ! the tour is captured well great footage and sound thanks for providing your fans with so much material to enjoy when you 're not around
is one of only a handful if any band 's that have been around for 25 years or more with all original it shows it 's easy to forget that there are only three musicians onstage playing 95 percent of the band comes onstage while the house lights are still on and procede to go into their first number elevation '' while they stay on until halfway through the great songs fill the hall all through the sound and picture will please any viewer only when the bono '' angle is pictured does it become slightly blurry in a little while '' is performed to perfection so is bad '' and many missing is one '' probably 's greatest song ever put to sound so is pride in the name of love '' and a few is still a very solid performance by four of the greatest irish rockers to ever walk the second dvd is pure bonus features music videos and alternate camera angles on certain songs from the first dvd easter eggs are also included in both dvd 's good luck ! collection belongs in every fan 's library it could very well even bring a tear to your this brilliant concert from bono and the
great dvd really enjoyed it ! especially the sunday bloody sunday song go check it out
this is a great dvd we really enjoy and have found this to be one of their better dvds i think you 'll enjoy it
be sure to catch the alternate views on disk 2. the view from the control booth with the director losing his mind in a good way is great they also have a beautiful day from the rooftop in boston
i never stopped being a fan however i did not like the direction that band was going during the popmart tour i had enough of dressing up like the village people and coming out of giant lemons pop was a decent album with some good songs they followed it up with zooropa which had to be their worst album i understand that was trying some type of sarcasm with the popmart tour they went away from what they do best great rock music and electric concerts i wanted to see the best live rock band in the world again finally got it right again and released all that you ca n't leave behind '' it was a collection of great lyrics and beautiful melodies this dvd is the concert tour of this album and it 's a good one as the pamphlet inside the dvd case the previous 2 concerts were huge public arts spectacles '' this concert was about what a great singer bono is what an awesome guitar player the edge is this was more about their performance and connection with the crowd than it was about giant screen televisions and lemons this is a great concert it starts with a great performance of elevation that will have you jumping up and down they follow it up with beautiful day which was done brilliantly you then hear the familiar beginnings of until the end of the world as the strobe lights start flashing bono walks along the heart shaped walkway shaking people 's hands this is vintage the crowd is really into it another highlight of the concert is their classic anthem sunday bloody sunday you become glued to the screen when you hear the beginning of bad bono sounds great the band is completely on towards the end of bad bono slips part of 40 '' in the music stops and the crowd is singing 40. bono and the crowd continue to chant back and forth as this is going on we hear the familiar begining of where the streets have no name this is the highlight of the concert as the lights start flashing and the edges guitars begin to rev up bono starts running around the heart attached to the stage which extends into the crowd he runs faster and faster around the stage until the crowd goes into a frenzy and bono starts singing you could barely hear bono singing because the crowd is singing along so loud with him this version of the song may be the best live performance of any song that i have ever seen truly incredible performance another highlight was with or without you bono pulls a girl from the audience as he is singing they lay down flat on their backs with bono holding her as he is singing you could see the girl 's lips synchronized with bono 's singing along the familiar words of the song i 'm sure it was a thrill for her it shows bono 's showmanship he knows how to command an audience great guitarwork by the edge on this one larry and adam are solid as always this dvd is excellent however it does have one flaw the constant shift in camera angles was very distracting i do not like the director 's hamish hamilton mtv style editing this concert was a great one but if you really want to capture the true experience go live from slane castle '' is a better choice the slane dvd captures the raw emotion that one feels when going to a concert the transformation from being a spectator to an active participant of the experience the boston dvd does have the feeling of a concert but is a little more staged however it is a must have for any dvd collection if you 're a fan it is even more of a must have this dvd truly deserves the highest rating
cars is an excellent pixar movie it 's a car version of thomas the tank engine with storyline references to doc hollywood but it 's easily the best pixar movie topping finding nemo the dvd has great special features such as an epilogue and the inspiration of cars i enjoy the animated short films one man band and mater and the ghostlight the folks at pixar have done it again brining in a great story great characters plenty of computer animated effects i especially am into vehicles
i collect all the pixar '' movies this one is exceptional
my son does too we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days and neither has gotten tired of it yet why we love it cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics the expressions and faces '' thay have and make and acting cause of the story it 's warm and fuzzy and funny SMILE cause of the way story is paced it never gets boring and slow but it does n't kill you with the tempo either cause its beautifully done not to say drawn cause we know it is n't just drawing any more the characters the details on them the city racetrack one of my favorites
i tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released not up to pixar standards i say it is most like a bugs life a good but not great film music did nothing for me where was the normal stand out musical score standard extras but no making of section i would have liked to have seen that something i hate about some dvd packages those horrible flip down openers yuck ! ! ! ! ! ! kids will enjoy nascar fans will enjoy fun but forgettable after you watch it
this is a great pixar movie this is my personal favorite pixar film it is extremely good graphics the director went on tracks to see how the track would look and asked real nascar narraters to do the narrating for the race scenes the plot is very good its about a car named lightning mc queen his life was racing and he was rude to people then he gets well you better find the rest out yourself the jokes are funny and the cast is so good this is a great movie for every one the bonus features are good to theres the bloopers but without the credits and then the inspiration for cars the sneak peaks are not to good though there is 5.1 sound and there scene selections are good there is allot so you can find where you left off i cant wait untill the 2 disc special edition comes out ! this is good movie for everyone from 5 to as old as you get so i recommend this movie cars you will have a long road ahead of you !
this is simply the cutest animated feature i have seen in years the characters are superb the art is fantastic the humor will catch young and old alike and i do mean young and old this is one cartoon that will be appreciated by those in their retirement years actually some of the puns will go right over the heads of the younger crowd the film had me laughing as much as i have laughed at anything for a l o n g time then just when i thought it was over a short follow up came after the credits then just when i thought that was over i discovered a couple of shorter animated bonus features and began laughing all over again i could find no faults i only have two suggestions 1. buy a copy for yourself 2. buy a copy as a gift for that special someone
according to me cars is the best the pixar studio has made toy story was the first the incredibles were but the cars are just simply the best ! i like the story i like the superb soundtrack and of course i love the animation it just made me feel that even cars have soul and feelings well maybe it wasnt a feeling but now i really believe that all the cars have feelings
cars is one of those movies that only pixar would dare to undertake whereas many of pixar 's past successes have been copied by other studios cars is a concept that stands alone the attention to detail in cars in everything from the motion of the vehicles to the breathtaking settings and animation is simply astounding when pixar decides to create a movie they do it right they do their research and it pays off with cars pixar has created a world populated solely by vehicles a world in which machines not only have faces but have real heart and soul pixar 's mechanical world is fleshed out enough to suspend disbelief without insulting or eliminating the need for the audience 's imagination the concept of anthropomorphic cars without humans may not sit perfectly in a logical sense but that 's okay much of the movie 's unique charm would have been lost with the inclusion of humans the world of cars is an alternate interpretation of our own it 's a what if '' world after all we spend so much time in our vehicles that to someone looking in from the outside it might appear as though the vehicles were the actual beings inhabiting the earth rather than the humans within them somehow cars makes surprising sense perhaps in some ways even moreso than the world that we do live in every scene in cars advances the movie 's purpose and the development of each character and every voice even every spoken line does the same cars is simply really touching there are plenty of laughs throughout but the real charm of the movie is its heart cars is n't about cheap comedy it 's a movie that makes you genuinely smile if you let it the characters are diverse and surprisingly realistic and the character interaction is unparalleled the message of the movie is not subtle or terribly complex but it 's real the story is n't anything completely revolutionary but it 's incredibly well polished and superbly executed without being overly predictable cars is one of the few movies i 've ever felt the desire to watch multiple times just to fully experience all of the detail and heart infused into every scene to be honest i 'm not a big car guy i probably would n't know an automotive joke if it hit me in the face i 've never cared a lick about racing and i do n't have any emotional ties or great interest in the history of the midwest yet i absolutely love this movie if nothing else i think that says a lot as for the dvd itself i 'm hoping for a set in the near future as this release is sadly lacking in the bonus feature department
imagine bergman with a touch of hitchcock or chabrol in this film about a father and two young sons on a fishing trip after twelve years of separation there is the bleakness and moral ambiguity of bergman 's world where people live isolated lives often on remote islands meanwhile there 's the creepy uncertainty that permeates the works of the masters of suspense in its stark focus on three characters traveling alone together it 's also reminiscent of polanski 's early film knife in the water '' visually the film is striking with its slow but persistent camera movement and the washed out color that reduces some scenes to monochrome meanwhile the soundtrack music is spare and eerie most striking of all are the performances as the taciturn and vaguely malevolent father interacts in unexpected ways with the two boys who regard him with varying degrees of trust and distrust at some level it 's a film about fathers and sons and the distance between them as the immaturity emotions fears and physical weakness of boys are confronted by the uncompromising expectations of hardened adult males who have shed any vestige of their own boyhoods as something to be scorned and we keep watching the man for signs of his true character as he responds to the two boys one of them willing to accept the man at his word the other deeply suspicious and openly rebellious based on a simple premise it 's a brilliantly conceived story that holds the viewer to the end leaving us finally with unanswered questions that provoke reflection on the loss of innocence and the uneasy relationship between family and self the dvd includes a documentary that reveals many of the challenges of directing and shooting the film not least interesting is its commentary on working with the film 's young actors
some reviewers stated that the return '' was filmed in siberia actually the lake where the main events take place is the lake ladoga the largest lake in europe which lies north of as far as my take on the return '' it 's one of the most haunting and moving films i 've ever seen
what if you had n't seen your father in twelve years and one day you came home and your mom said that he was sleeping in the bedrooom that 's exactly what happens to the two young brothers andrey and ivan when the mysterious man just arrived who claims to be their father decides to take them on a fishing trip for bonding time as the movie progresses it is evident to both the movie viewer and the brothers that something is n't quite right every once in a while the father turns around and just seems to do something absolutely strange from a violent outburst causing his motives to be questioned to moments of a possible attempt at actually spending time with his sons both of the brothers experience separate reactions the older one trusts his father while the younger is reluctant which often causes strife between them haunting disturbing and in some ways sad the return is more of a slow and thoughtful film to be appreciated for its subtleties each part is acted quite well the characters are believable and made real through the their hardships and obvious uncertainties i think the thing that makes the return such a special movie is the relationship between each separate person and seeing how they treat one another it 's fun trying to figure out whether or not the father really is good or bad although a warning beforehand a few things are left for you to form your own opinion about perhaps that is what the director wanted and it does n't harm the film might even make the ending more effective and powerful so keep an open mind and do n't be disappointed this is n't like american movies where every loose end has to be tied up at the close however messy or unbelievable
while i very much admired it let me say that people with short attention spans will not enjoy the russian film the return vozvrashcheniye it has a simple storyline spare dialogue and long takes watching it one senses allegorical intentions of an almost biblical proportion after a while which is another way of saying that this is an art film albeit a gorgeously filmed and affecting one i was very sad to learn that the young man who plays the older brother andrey vladimir garin died in a boating accident not long after the return was completed this is odd and poignant as andrey he spends a lot of time in a small rowboat and he was a compelling actor whose face is a fascinating canvas of stubbornness humor and hope his brother ivan dobronravov also gives a bravura performance as to the film with its mythic aspirations it could easily have fallen flat but it does n't instead director andrey zvyagintsev 's ambitions are realized through the believable acting gorgeous cinematography and intentionally storyline the return is not the kind of movie that you love but you sure do think about it after the credits roll
one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
some of the diaries of the german troops heading east to the attack on russia seem to elicit not so much a fear of the russian army as being thunderstruck by the vastness of russia the immensity of the country comes across in this purely russian movie about two boys reunited with their father after a hiatus of 12 years since the boys ivan and andrei are so young they have no independant memory of him and are forced to run to a secret hiding place where they have ferreted away a photograph of him both nod affirmatively 'it 's him ' one of our weaknesses as americans whether we travel to foreign countries or read foreign books or see foreign movies is that we expect to see the usa in a foreign tongue when we do n't we criticise the effort because in our minds it does n't measure up 'it just ai n't normal gladys ! ' so one thing this film is n't is that it is n't american we do n't know what the father was up to we do n't know why he came back millions and millions of sons and daughters grew up in that sad anonymous fungible childhood that was eastern europe after communism and in some families men returned and in some other men returned there was n't any leave it to beaver '' and there were n't any waltons '' beautifully filmed we see the boys taken on a painful and lengthy journey and in a manner of speaking the journey represents their passage from adolescence to something else not adulthood but something just before that it 's beautiful and worth the effort but it ai n't rocky 5 stars larry scantlebury
this is not a film of realism but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of russian culture would understand russian or non not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment societal coldness or irrational revenge which it is on the surface but if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for 3 on netflix and it ruined your evening then i would suggest that you stick with the stroll progulka or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern russia brave directors take chances and that is why they are the best but sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself no one blames you for that and i really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography sometimes movies do fail to make a point but this is not one of them in my view basically if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a tarkovsky fan i would say that tarkovsky is an influence on zvyagintsev but zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do modern russia free russia is full of surprises this is not a digital camera you know you have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy amazon reviews are at you disposal make your decision rent it and then buy it or do not why discourage others who have not had the chance to view it themselves do not give into big brother we are a democracy and we are strong think and evolve
the abandon of the familiar nucleus by the father has been told so many times in too many places in latin america is a very common place the wide gamut of feelings this fact may arouse are so many and so randomly that hardly can be expressed or resumed but through little testimonials this chamber work deals with this painful issue a father decades to return to his family after twelve years his wife does not doubt to forgive him almost instantaneously but ivan possesses a very difficult character he won ' t forgive him with such easiness the father does n't transmit his feelings sunk in his own world and trying to get some affection he invites his sons to fish this journey will be the big frame in which the complex dramatis personae will unfold a crude and incisive glimpse around one of the most sorrowful and common portraits in any latitude of this world the visual language is superb this young director conquered the admiration of great audiences around the world the film awarded several important prizes it is magnificent in all orders a little gem of this promising and gifted do not miss his name
this is a truly great movie that is wasted on american audiences that are accustomed to the shallow themes a truly beautiful movie for those who are deep and sensitive i did not find it slow for it has great depth and almost hypnotic quality it held my attention throughout and this is very hard to do i got lost in the movie but of course those who like cheap thrills and are shallow could never appreciate it
i agree with most of the other reviewers regarding mom of many munchkins review she was way too critical ! for hating the dvd so much she has it memorized she is correct about the uh '' sound but my son has started talking so much since we got this dvd from our local library he has even started saying complete sentances ! brainy baby may not be perfect but they are obviously doing something right he also watches it from beginning to end without getting bored and even giggles when the babies giggle it is very cute ! i think they did a great job we have to remember that this video was made for babies and toddlers not grown up adults
this review was very difficult for me to write as i have mixed feelings toward the video as a first grade teacher i am very critical of anything that requires the very particular and accurate use of phonemic awareness unfortunately as the mom in the last review pointed out this video has many inconsistencies when the narrator and little girl say their letter sounds first of all when saying letter sounds one never wants to add the sound after any letter ! ! for example when saying the sound for t '' we do n't say tuh '' we simply whisper it by dropping our tougue from the roof to the bottom of our mouth or we say w '' not by saying wuh '' but by forming the w with our lips then holding the w sound like wwwwww though most of the sounds in this video are correct they occasionally slip into the '' trap ! how on earth are our children supposed to read if they add to every consonant me instance what the heck is ! translation without the and you get the word pat '' ! now looking beyond the inconsistencies in pronounciation i have to say that my 2 year old son loves the video ! ! ! i am completely in awe and amazed that within one time of watching it he repeats every letter as it drops onto the screen though i find it terribly repetitive and boring he is completely engrossed ! ! and you know he is the one who is supposed to love the video not me ! so i suppose brainy baby has hit the mark on that aspect ! he sits through the seven minute introduction and is totally aware as each written letter comes on he enjoys the kids and babies on the screen and it does n't seem to bother him that there is no real action '' or fun puppets like they have in the baby einstein videos so as a mother i am overjoyed that he is enjoying the video learning his letters and gaining a nice vocabulary he is slightly speech delayed so anything that will help to improve his language awareness is a blessing so how do i rate this as a teacher probably no more than a 3. as a mother i 'd have to give this a 5 since my own child is rapidly developing his language awareness just by watching a simple dvd ! i have n't watched any other letters video so if anyone has any suggestions i 'd love to hear them !
believe it ! this is a great video brainy baby just seems to really know how to connect with children when it comes to teaching the lady who gave this a one star and wrote a book about her feelings is a bit over the top and has way too much time on her hands we also homeschool our children and found that this video really helped them when they were younger to learn the alphabet remember this is a preschool video ! your children are being introduced to learning situations not studying for a college exam ! we have found that all the brainy baby videos are top quality and do an excellent job of teaching our boys knew the entire upper case and all the letter sounds around months ! it was amazing and i know that these videos played a big part in that i am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers after doing a little research i found a little known fact that it was brainy baby that created the first set of '' videos over 10 years ago way before the einstein series so that really gave me confidence that the producers at brainy baby really had the experience and track record my advice i do n't see how you could go wrong for a mere 15 investment in your child 's future i own all of them and wish brainy baby would make more !
this video is amazing ! after 1 week of viewing this video twice a day once in the morning and once after nap time my 18 month old daughter could sing the alphabet song and recognize both upper case and lower case letters if you are determined to give your child the best head start and realize that education begins at home you will run out and purchase this video for your child now i only wish i had picked it up for her when she was 6 months old i will purchase this video as a baby shower gift before a baby einstein video and we love our einsteins
i purchased this dvd for my son at christmas he was 26 months old and has autism up to this point he only could say a couple of words he had shown interest in the alphabet though when i first watched the dvd with him i thought it was really dry and boring and he hardly watched any of it but then we played it a few more times and he started to show a lot of interest soon he was saying many of the letters and within a week knew the whole alphabet two months later he is saying 25 words and i think it all started with learning the alphabet ! although i still do n't think it is a very exciting video and yes some of the letters are not pronounced correctly it has done a world of good for my son !
thank you brainy baby for this video ! i looked all over to find a quality video in order to introduce and reinforce the abc 's to my 17 month old i began introducing the alphabet to her at age 6 months and she now knows the letters by name and can sing '' the abc song i bought this to help reinforce her knowledge because i like that it starts out by singing the traditional abc song several times and then it goes into presenting each letter i also like that it shows real life images of children and other objects and its not just a bunch of fanciful images set to classical music at the end they sing the abc song one final time i think this a great buy for teaching abcs its simple and its exactly how most people would teach it
i just ca n't say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about 6 months old he loves them and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen SMILE as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile he is captivated i like them much more than the baby einstein videos and the toys loves them hello brainy baby ! '' they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time we love brainy baby at our house
i am a speech pathologist and was surpised by another review that complained about the repetition in this video that is how children learn by repetition ! ! remember this series is designed for the cognitive and learning skills of the year old set not an adult ! i have a 3.5 year old who barely sits still yet the children and action in this video keep his attention yes there are instrumental and singing portions but that is what kids love i have several in this series and my kids love them all both my kids learned their abc 's by watching this video along with practicing with foam letters in the bathtub i find the brainy baby series to be much more educational than the baby einstein videos for those of you who feel your children have advanced beyond the baby einstein videos i would highly recommend this series great for the preschool age group
my 20 month old son loves this dvd he has taken a real liking to the alphabet song and stays glued to the tv whenever this dvd is on he also recognizes the objects associated with each letter and likes to point out or sign according to the asl signs he 's familiar with the objects that he knows good product
sometimes i watch a movie and it turns out to be far more entertaining than i thought it would be such is the case with cellular i had seen the ads for the film and even though it starred kim bassinger i thought that the movie was n't going to be entertaining at all my brother had seen the movie when it came out in theatres and had enjoyed it immensely he as especially intrigued by the average citizen becoming a hero '' angle when i borrowed the movie from him to watch i tried my best to put my predispositions aside and suspended my disbelief i surprisingly found myself becoming immersed in an and suspenseful story cellular takes places in the showy and flashy wealthy environment of southern california jessica martin kim bassinger is a high school science teacher who lives with her realtor husband and son in the suburb of brentwood after dropping her son off at school jessica 's home is invaded by a gang of thugs her housekeeper is shot and she is kidnapped and taken hostage the kidnappers want something her husband has and she has no idea what it is the criminals lock her in the attic and smash the building 's only phone as they plan to later kidnap both her son and her husband jessica must teach at a private high school because she is able to scrounge together the parts and revive them into a working telephone she is only able to call blindly and reaches a young and immature kid named ryan chris evans who is cruising down venice beach on an errand for his friend in an attempt to win her back at first ryan thinks the call is a joke but he soon becomes convinced and attempts to help jessica as best he can thus begins a lengthy adventure of car chases attempted killings more kidnappings uncaring salespeople a carjacking people playing their car stereos too loud and crooked cops for ryan all while trying to maintain a constant conversation with jessica via his cell phone the basic concept of cellular seems incredulous at first however it works rather well cell phones have become ubiquitous in our modern society except i do n't have one yet and as far fetched as some of the events in movie seem at first the more one thinks about the situation the more credible the idea becomes the film 's writer larry cohen also wrote the movie phone booth this movie tackles some of the same issues that were touched upon in that film but fleshes them out a bit should cohen decide to write another movie about communication devices it could very well be a sensation perhaps another reason that cellular works so well is because of the acting even if you have no desire to see the movie because of the concept see the film because of kim bassinger and william macy who plays a good cop named mooney who is preparing to retire from the force bassinger is lovely to watch and her portrayal of a kidnapped mother is convincing macy brings a lot of humanity and humor to a character that could have been rather dry and dull in the hands of a lesser actor chris evans also does a decent job and seems to mature as an actor as his character matures as a person on screen some of that might be because evans ended up doing almost all of his own stunts in the film overall i really enjoyed watching cellular it 's not necessarily a great movie but it is a good that is n't a waster of one 's time the dvd includes three documentaries an audio commentary and a trailer i found the documentaries informative and engaging one calling out '' is on the history of telephones and how cellular phones have and are continuing to change society dialing up cellular '' is about the making of the film code of silence inside the rampart scandal '' is about a 1999 lapd corruption scandal i had n't heard of this case before and i found it quite interesting especially how the writer was able to incorporate some of these events as a plotline for the film
this is one of my favorite movies in recent years in the film jessica kim basinger is kidnapped and manages to click the wires on a smashed phone to place a call she reaches beach slacker ryan chris evans and manages to convince him that she 's telling the truth and to get help what ensues is a mad rush through downtown los angeles as ryan tries desperately to assist her the dvd has some good features on it interviews scene selection etc and the movie overall was well made if you are into this sort of movie i recommend it you will not be disappointed in the least bit
cellular is a sleeper hit a long overdue example of a real thriller that is and great driving and action scenes are complemented by humor the story is about a carefree california youth who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving dirty la cops and a kidnapped family kim basinger turns in a great performance as the wife and mother fighting for her life against ethan the leader of the corrupt cops played by jason statham the transporter ethan is a competent bad guy my husband and i loved this movie it has the equivalent of black coffee
while not on the level of the interpreter '' in terms of plot depth and character development cellular '' delivers what it says it will a fast paced tense thriller that will please most people the plot is complex enough to keep the watcher guessing what exactly will happen and not bore the audience there are a number of tense scenes that add to the overall suspense and thrill of the movie if you 're in the mood for a fast paced thriller this will not disapoint you
i saw this on cable and was skeptical because the premise of the movie sounded kind of dumb it revolved around a cellular phone however it turned out to be a great movie there were never any dull moments and it was just fun to watch i would n't mind owning a copy of it if i could get a good deal on the price
having visited petersburg russia a year ago i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie i must say it was nicely done i can relate to the obnoxious business like brother who happily did not go with me on my trip i was more like the younger brother but not quite so as the character protrayed the scenery was awesome all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty and this goes for the women as well ! ! i mainly went to see the city but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion what i did n't expect was to really fall in love SMILE the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her quickly changed my way of thinking ! ! one thing i should add though the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself such is not the case it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here expect at least 8 months but it is more like a year it is time consuming to get her a us visa but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover the wait is worthwhile another word of caution prepare yourself to fall in love with russia the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and some even live there now
my favorite movies are those with interesting characters and engrossing dialogue this movie has both and was delightful and entertaining
i 'll be honest i only watched this movie because it has emily mortimer in it the first time anyway the second third and fourth times were for the very simple reason that i loved the movie action lovers be warned it moves at a very slow pace although for some reason it never drags and its appeal lies almost entirely in the performances of tim blake nelson and emily mortimer maybe i should explain a bit the film is about two brothers shocking is n't it whose late mother spoiled them beyond reason they are incapable of fending for themselves even to do laundry their home is such a disaster that they can not even find a maid who is willing to work more than one day desperate they finally reach the obvious ! conclusion wife ! using the actual international matchmaking agency a foreign affair the older brother jake nelson books tickets to russia where they hope to find a woman who will keep house in exchange for a green card once they reach petersburg though the brothers find they are not the only ones interested in russian brides a documentary filmmaker mortimer offers to translate for jake as long as he allows her to follow him around with a camera in his face both brothers begin to learn a bit more about themselves women and the world at large the movie was shot in an almost documentary style including several interviews with real men who had actually gone to petersburg to find wives seriously but if this were a documentary it would be the most hilarious one i ever watched the movie is obviously not for everyone if you like black comedy this is the way to go but if your taste runs more towards gags and obvious jokes avoid it like the plague
terriffic movie just shows how some people make the most of thier lives and tackle the cruelest of diseases with dignity and an inspirational inner stregnt
this movie is wonderful although it did n't exactly make me cry it did touch me in a sentimental way i fell in love with morrie he is such a sweet guy and his story is an inspiration to everyone i was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life even though fate had handed him a death sentence he made up his mind that he was n't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible and i really admire that i was also pleased with the effect morrie had on his old college student mitch mitch learns to appreciate life 's little surprises and to not be in such a big rush all the time he learns to relax and smell the roses to let go of old grudges to value the people in his life and he even learns to allow himself to cry my most favorite scene is where mitch actually breaks down and bawls and morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other this scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film although it 's the last time that mitch ever sees morrie alive it 's still very sweet and poignant the ending is pretty sad but it 's also happy at the same time morrie is gone yet his legacy lives on i recommend this movie to anyone of any gender of any age
this movie was so very well done and so very sad it will from behind you and pleasure you in a way you did n't expect but will leave you feeling very sad at the end sad but inspired and that is what this movie is about inspiration morrie was a great character who was always pitching a tent '' so to speak i highly recommend this movie
this is an excellent story about what life is really all about the book and dvd make excellent gifts too i highly recommend both products !
the film exhibition as the act of dying can be lived with love and people that love each other enter creating a protection atmosphere of support of peace morrie gives us a life lesson in the death
i 've seen this movie on tv a few years ago but it just would n't leave my mind so i ordered the dvd it 's one of those movies you wo n't forget because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach ' as mitchell calls it morrie is a great coach and if you watch this movie you will see why it is so heartbreaking an old wise man a long lost friend who teaches the last course in his life at home one student a must have seen
this movie makes you think about things we do n't think about everyday life death and what 's important defintiely an deep and emotional at times
i had read the book first befoe viewing the tv movie and to tell you the truthe i could n't tell which came first the chicken movie or the egg book jack lemon and the rest of the cast were suberb
it took me all of 4 hours to read this book it was insightful and entertaining it was also sad i cried so hard at the end of the book that i hiccuped for 3 hours i work at a children 's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children ' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve i highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face any type of challenge whether mental physical financial whatever
very good film with a great cast reese and wahlberg are wonderful in their roles and play them to perfection walhberg especially very much worth
what a cast ! mark wahlberg reese witherspoon william petersen amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl witherspoon and her seemingly perfect boyfriend wahlberg of course the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance william petersen csi is outstanding as the witherspoon 's concerned father who has way too many issues himself this film is a hidden gem buy it you will not be disappointed
alyssa milano is hot hot hot i like this movie it is like a reverse teen version of fatal attraction made after the crush and before swimfan fell right in between and much better film than both much more suspenseful and better actors at that
was this crazy or what mark did a very unbelievable job and he play that roll right down to the scarey i have n't been in a releationship like that but for those who are i hope they get out of it ok
even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure it still contains excellent early performances by mark wahlberg reese witherspoon and a maturing alyssa milano production value is high so this is definitely not a the plot is a familiar one good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho but the lack of originality does n't take away from the interesting progression of the movie directing editing writing and acting are still top notch and even though wahlberg 's character ends up going off the deep end he portrays a believable 'normal ' guy in the beginning even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie he made a pretty good psycho as well i enjoyed the film and would even watch it again
this is hardly a new story but it still effectively told under the grunge setting of the time and the somewhat hoaky lines that mark wahlberg says and that scene on the roller coaster i do n't care who you are it 's not happening that way reese witherspoon plays nicole a sweet faced 16 year old freshly transported from seattle to live with her father and step mother still somewhat neive and overly friendly with all she meets she meets a handsome stranger named david mark wahlberg at first all seems well as he wins over her parents and they are enjoying the bloom of new love but david has a dark side whose jealous nature emerges slowly but surely eventually he shows that he does n't just have a dark side but is outright dangerous lies about the past violence and the inevitable ending in a blaze of glory violence take place this is a movie all girls should watch it teaches us all about the bad boys a part of us is drawn to the bad boy whose dangerous and somewhat psychotic side appeals to girls why because we girls want to be bad ourselves and we are trying to live it through the bad boy reese whiterspoon 's friend played by alyssa milano is the more obvious example she picks up the ugliest greasiest man in the room praces around in her hootchie mama outfits because he wants her to and allows herself to be used and abused until it 's too late fortunately for reese her sexuality is kept under under more modest wraps of course we must learn these lessons by doing no matter what your friends family or even the movies can tell you eventually we can see through these thin venirs and get past it if you want to be a bad girl be one on your own time the bad boys of this world are lots of fun most are tornados in the sack but cheat left and right wrap chairs around heads and will call and ask for bail money sell crazy and codependent someplace else
this is a great movie and one of my favorites i watched this movie back in 2002 and bought it a couple of months ago when i saw it at the acting is great reese witherspoon mark walhberg highly recommended
what makes such an impact here is that it 's not that far fetched my was just like mark wahlbergs charactor he was abusive and manipulitive and downright aggresive overly and jealous beyond no end that to me is what makes this movie so scary not really scary but intence it 's very close to home and very real this could happen this does happen because there are people that are really like this mark wahlberg plays the perfect psycho all sweet on the outside but you can see through it that was my you almost wonder why they bother to pretend because it 's so obvious you can see through the fasade too bad reese could n't then again neither could me sister teenage girls beware just because he says nice things to you and you lost your virginity to him does n't mean you should forgive him when he punches your friend in the face and tries to kill you family very well acted on all fronts with a tightly wound believable script recomended
this movie is crazy good marky mark plays such an excellent psycho and reese whitherspoon does a great job of playing the teen the suspense keeps building and building in this thriller for a dramatic ending an excellent movie and an excellent movie to own
this movie is great i just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it i throughly enjoyed it entirely i believe it kind of relates to fatal attraction
for my wife and i this was a return to the year when we were dating this film was playing and we went to see it she liked the soundtrack so much that i bought it for her as a gift this was in 1961 or 1962. we enjoyed the movie then and enjoyed it more this time because of the memories the fact that we are older and seem to understand a little more about the world also enhanced the experience buy it you will like it
compelling movie in light of recent news the birth of israel in the late 40 's is still the cause of much conflict in the middle east i recommend that a individual watch this movie with his heart and not solely on it 's performance by the actors there was a way of making movies back then that is not seen today no cgi in this just location scenes a very watchable movie
otto preminger 's exodus is a very well made film this is a big film and director preminger is a master at handling films of this scale he is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature well that is preminger 's style straighforward and technically proficient movie making
otto preminger 's 1960 cinematic presentation of the founding of israel from an adaptation of leon uris 's novel is strictly filmmaking that is a good thing and the best way to approach this novel and subject the methodical progression of the story concisely and dramatically interprets events and puts them into a historical perspective for future thought and discernment otto preminger 's singular purpose is to tell how israel came into existence he skirts political and moral issues with hackneyed characters and their simplistic points of view to get his story across the overall effect of this film is moving enhanced with composer ernest gold 's inspiring score and central theme the cast is impressive and includes paul newman eva marie saint ralph richardson sal mineo hugh griffith lee cobb john derek peter lawford marius goring good casting david opatoshu martin benson and jill haworth
this is an excellent movie but could have been even better and as a previous reviewer noted it would have made a great even at 3 hours the plot is very compressed what took years to happen in real life seems like only months in the movie i found myself looking up events on the internet in order to keep track with what year it was in the movie some of the plot seems far fetched at first subjecting children to a hunger strike for example and the prison break scene is right out of robin hood '' i was amazed therefore to learn these events really happened the acting is wooden in places but nevertheless you grow to care about the characters the scenery and music are magnificent the ending is a disappointment though here comes a spoiler we never get to see the actual birth of israel in may 1948. instead the movie ends shortly before that with paul newman 's character giving an idealistic speech about arabs and jews living in peace the viewer is cheated out of seeing how newman 's character reconciles his idealism with the reality of the war for independence the movie is also quite poignant it was made in 1960 and all the extras we see dancing around the kibbutz were real israelis it 's sad to think that all those children and happy young people grew up to experience no end to war another irony is that jewish terrorists play a prominent role in the film using bombs in an attempt to drive the british out of palestine
it gets harder and harder to watch this movie especially the young paul newman 's final screed on the death of karen relax butch ! jill haworth 's only pretending to the dead ! as a document of the transition from gandhi 's hunger strike intended to embarass the british into behaving decently to the irgun 's ruthless bombing of the king david hotel intended to bloody the british into leaving israel alone and unprotected in the exact middle of her traditional blood enemies arabs what arabs it 's informative the movie barely scratches the surface of hatreds that have festered in the middle east for millenia and the glossy hollywood overcoat has peeled away from the history over the years but as a faithful reflection of a naivete we americans will have to overcome to have any hope of surviving nuclear armageddon on ariel sharon 's cattle ranch it 's pretty good in today 's world sal mineo 's deep dark secret that he was raped by nazis in dachau seems laughable these days you can hear that kind of gangsta rap from the toyota next to you at a red light as a call to menschlichkeit in a harsh world 4 stars
i saw this movie when i was 13 and thought is was good times and relations were different with israel then today the movie still has such relevance even though our relation with israel is quite different it is a classic and one of the best from this era
what would you do on a given day if you knew that you had the power to make it as you wish watch this dvd and learn of your power to not only create your day but to create a day that is incredible do you know someone who is a victim who thinks that their life is what has been dished out to them if so do them a favor and give this as a gift change your life and the lives of others highly recommended
as a student of the ramtha school of enlightement and after hearing about the what the bleep movie and editorials i thought at fist this was a rather very simplistic view of how quantum mechanics and neurological principles relates to the science of creating your day but then again after purchasing the dvd and hearing it several times and actually practicing it teachings a few times is when i began to actually see the magic of this teaching you see the problem we have as humans beings is that we have developed what is called a personality identification lets call this personality id pid since we first came to this plane of existance this material world we know as our reality since the first moment we have being constantly recieving and storing information in our neuronet or what ramtha calls the yellow brain that has come from the environment around us parents relatives friends extrangers etc together with information feedback from our own experiences with people places things times events of this interaction of information that has come to us and how we have responded to it throughout the years has created a pattern of response that is very particular to each of us this particular way of pattern mechanism has created some neurological pattern conections in our neurocortex brain it is like a computer program and it is what we call our personality the science of how to create your day teaches a simple method of how we can disconnect from the program of our personality if we wnat to change something in our progamed personality that we dont like ! maybe we want to gain some weigth or the other way around maybe we want to act in a different way maybe we want to be more agressive with people at work or maybe we want to be a calm person and not be so aggresive we want to change depreession we want to stop drinkin too much liquor maybe we want to be a nicer person to our whatever it is we want to change its something we have not being able to do because we are still connetced wired to the old program of our personality ! so in creating your day the master teacher send us a very simple yet profound technique on how to disconect from the old wiring of the personlity and create a new reality in our brain that will make possible the things we want to change in our lives ! you want to change your life change the way you think but in order to do so you must first of all learn how to disconetc for the old program of your personality this beautifull simple teaching tell you how you can do it ! may you become the person you really want to be
when i first saw this movie i really did n't know what to think its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for enjoyment '' that being said i love this movie and here 's why 1. it 's a true story 2. it is extremely patriotic even if it 's patriotism displayed by the wrong '' country how can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country this was in my opinion and i feel the only flaw was harrison ford playing a russian if you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing but i appreciate this film very much for the values it displays
it 's 1961 the ussr has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the east coast of the united states for the purpose of brinksmanship but hold on there is a problem the soviet union is staffed with incompetents ! ! one of communism 's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel the menacing black submarine is doomed from the it leaks and it is cobbled together with substandard parts after heading out to sea there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits the men receive lethal doses of radiation but unfortunately the doctor does n't know anything about radiation sickness he is only giving them aspirin before long radiation begins to permeate the ship the entire crew is in danger the officers are of two minds some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the americans while others want to save face for the soviet union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die as the submarine becomes more and more disabled as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby american destroyer as the submarines 's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat the dread of the crew is really palpable this movie was very suspenseful because i had no idea how it would end definitely worth your time
in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event ! it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the harrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains and as believable as their rebuilt authentic ! kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd bottom line this new kind of sub film is a part of history if you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best if you enjoy thrillers this film delivers enough tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the and in anyone
for those who do n't know russian the title of this was review of thought i 'd be funny there this movie is not so much a combat movie it 's a what happened movie the flagship of the russian navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 captians yea that kinda do n't go over so well they have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys it is quite a gripping movie though this is also one that needs to be bought not just rented
this was a true story and a scary part of our history the book comes to life in the movie i pictured another person as the captain of the sub ford did a good job acting the part
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october '' or crimson tide '' whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian
there are so much information about this movie in description and other reviews so i do n't want to repeat them the only problem in this movie was harisson ford 's style he was acting more american than russian and for moments you may feel that is an american submarine and harisson ford is an american captain he was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts he could n't deny his american friquent style ! i think harrison ford for this movie was not a wise decision i know starring first class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie
the widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961 when a soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown harrison ford and liam neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense ford portrays the overly harsh commander and neeson the captain in touch with the men probably the best submarine movie there is especially when compared to the ridiculous crimson tide '' and '' the cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown
for those that love barbara cook 's splendid vocal ability and the music of sondhim this is a real treat this is as close as one can get without being at a live concert
i 've never seen barbara cook live but have always been a big fan this dvd is indeed fantastic but i was slightly disappointed on the cover there is a picture of her in a sparkly top simply glowing in the spotlight this picture is obviously not from the performance on the dvd in this dvd performance she 's wearing some sort of pantsuit outfit and the whole atmosphere is much more casual than i thought it was going to be from the glamorous picture on the jacket i thought this was going to be an big show orchestra instead it is a very intimate show with just piano accompaniment not that it is bad on the contrary it is a wonderful performace it is simply different than i 'd expected nonetheless i still love it and recommend it highly
barbara cook is a phenomenon this dvd is so wonderful it is simply hard to describe of course her performance is first rate but what really makes this disc a cut above is the master class available in the bonus features how fascinating to get into the mind of a show business genius ! and just by the shots of the crowd it is obvious that all are totally mesmorized by the experience she takes the kids from being talented to being stars right before your very eyes i can not recommend this any higher go barbara
the hughes brothers created a nightmarish vision of victorian london only matched by some of dickens novels johnny depp and heather graham are fabulous as the police inspector investigating the case and a prostitute who is a friend to the victims the film is beautifully shot and the atmosphere of the grimy southside of london is captured incredibly well the murder scenes are very graphic and this is definitely not for the squeemish or the very young depp plays a role similar to the one he played in sleepy hollow but this is a much more serious movie aimed at a different audience my kids loved sleepy hollow but i would n't let them watch this it would give them nightmares for a week the plot is interesting and while fictional it has enough plausibilty to engage the viewer for it 's entire length johnny depp is an incredible talent after seeing him in this pirates slepy hollow and edward scissorhands i have to conclude that this guy is the best actor of his generation he is always interesting to watch
from hell '' is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography i 've ever seen in a horror movie although the story about who jack the ripper is is a little contrived at times in general the plot is interesting all the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you 'd expect considering the it keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours not to mention it looks beautiful heather graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the victorian era and johnny depp is amazing as usual although as others have pointed out his english accent may be a little off which i would n't know about since i 'm american this film is great entertainment and i would highly recommend buying the dvd if you rent it you 'll more than likely end up buying it anyway it 's that good from hell '' makes a great addition to any movie collection
a refreshing look at the ripper with a good insight into the secret societies depp as usual plays a very good part a great movie
if you follow my reviews you know that i felt the version of jack the ripper '' with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we do n't know and never will while i respect this version with johnny depp it is more horror oriented michael caine 's version was more historical onto the subject at hand some of you may know jack 's 5 victims mary anne nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride kathy eadows and mary jane kelly well they seem to have a close friendship and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret in the michael caine version the 5 victims knew each other but they were just associates well of course jack the ripper comes into play one scene is very well done in that while we do n't see his face we do see some disturbing pictures and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine in comes depp inspector fred abberline it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday but maybe depp did n't want to just imitate caine one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors depp 's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion without giving the story away his superiors must have known things that they did n't tell depp ! at least caine 's superiors carried some reason on their side ! you 'll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did probably because caine 's version was 4 hours while depp 's is only 2 while caine was involved with an artist depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly gradually depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle like caine did in his version depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer of course depp does not know he is talking to the killer well another problem here is that in the caine version we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version i will admit that the scenery is well done the elements of horror are there and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine and depp 's sergeant godley does offer some entertainment but if you saw the michael caine version you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy if on the other hand you do n't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history you 'll probably find it a respectable horror movie side note johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he 's going to die anyday well in reality fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper
from hell i do n't think i can give a very good review of this movie because it is based on actual events and the case was never solved and i 'm not familiar with the facts that do exist about it all i can say is that given what i know which is extremely limited i think this is a good portrayal of what may have been of course i think johnny depp was awesome in his role of the inspector in charge of the case but then again i love him so i 'm not normally a fan of movies that take us back so far in time but this one did n't bother me i guess that is probably because of the subject matter it 's one of those instances where plot overrules period that does n't happen very often for me so i 'm impressed with that alone so i guess for me that about sums up my review i 'm sure it 's not very helpful unless you can use the information about johnny depp and the info about historical films if so i 'm glad i could be of service !
what can i say about johnny depp he 's a gorgeous smart talented actor ! he melts my heart ! he 's one of a kind actor ! that 's what i love about him ! plus that he 's totally hot !
as usual a riveting performance fromone of my favorites highly recommended for depp fans
it was recieved earlier than expected and in perfect condition i was very satisfied with my purchase
i do n't understand why there are so many mixed reviews on this dvd i guess the people that gave this dvd a poor review do n't understand david cross ' sense of humor i bought this dvd on a whim since it was a low price well aware that it was not a concert dvd it is in fact a filmed by lance bangs of jackass fame i thought this dvd was well worth my 13 and it 's one of those i can watch again and again i would n't recomend buying this dvd unless you really understand show and david cross ' humor if you 're a fan of both i guarantee you 'll love this
and i did until i cried david cross has to be one of the bravest funniest it or eloquent comics performing today i thought it was very original to do this kind of dvd instead of just rehashing everything that was on 'shut up you baby ' instead we get to see what it 's like to be on tour with david and get a glimpse of some of the colourful people that he gets to meet on a daily basis the fans of show should be pleased to know that bob odenkirk even makes an appearance and says one of the funniest 'heckles ' i 've ever heard in my life i honestly do n't get some of the reviews for this dvd especially since most of them are coming from david show fans if you see a review that contains the words i had experienced david cross through his part in scary movie 2 '' do yourself a favour and take that one with a grain of salt my only complaint with the dvd is that david has yet to do a canadian tour so that we too can get in on the fun
no not really but i liked the sound of that title this movie was recommended to me by my great friend bobby asslong who 's recommendations are usually quite odd and contrived but this time he hit the mark right on ! jack black and steve zahn are absolutely hilarious and jason biggs plays the straight one in the title role i personally did n't think jason did as good a job as he could have done but that 's just my opinion i personally do n't care for jason 's acting the in this movie are priceless and i actually really got turned on by amanda peet when she was working to get by the steve zahn character friggin awesome ! watching this movie reminds me of a very good friend of mine named ronald freidman he is actually more p whipped than the jason biggs character in this movie ! his wife jacquelina rides him hard and puts him away wet every singly day of the week as she gambles away her savings at a nearby indian casino 3 and 4 times per week i actually saw her slap him with a lot of force at a recent party what a lousy life she makes for him ! i think my boy bobby a and i should make a movie called saving freidman ! hey it could work ! two big thumbs way up ! ! ! mc white said check it out ! !
whether it 's watching network news or playin ' pull my finger '' it does n't take much to make me laugh more importantly hit me between the eyes with ribald sophomoric humor humor as meaningful as a clown reading shakespeare and i 'm good to go do n't give me woody allen give me cheech chong and a box of pizza rolls which is why saving silverman floats my boat this flick has a stupid story a triumvirate of buds torn apart by the girlfriend from hades and the steps taken by the two friends on the outside looking in to bust up the romance antics goofy shtick and a healthy dose of cornball but it 's darn funny and as unpretentious as a mongrel using a fire hydrant this movie reminds me of the best way to ride a rollercoaster just let go and have fun jason biggs is okay as the nerdy and whipped friend who must be saved '' probably not much of an acting stretch for him yet steve zahn and jack black are superb as the two buds doing the saving these guys make a great comedic team they ought to hook up again in another movie but as good as zahn and black are amanda peet steals the show as the girlfriend who wo n't give up her man under any circumstances and some circumstances in this film are considerable as mentioned above saving silverman does n't garner any blueblood points but it serves up blue collar humor in spades mikels author
this movie is hilarous ! i like the part when someone was doing yoga for crude and sexual humor language and thamatic for anyone 10 and up
saving silverman is my favorite movie of all time i 'm a huge neil diamond fan so this is probably biased but i do n't care jack black and steve zahn are hilarious and this movie is a
this is one of the best comedies ever made someone else wrote it sucked and that sean william scott was a talented actor which shows how much that guy knows in conclusion comingtoyaaaahaaa
hilarious movie this movie made me laugh alot the part where they break into the house and jack black goes into the kitchen and starts to eat that cracked me up definately check this movie out its really funny itll make you laugh alot some of its stupid funny but most is just real funny stuff anytime you have jack black in a movie like this you can expect it to be pretty funny check this out
steve zahn is one of my favorite comedic actors and is brilliant in this film teamed up with jack black the duo really steals the show from biggs who still is good in what i believe is his second movie neil diamond makes a great cameo appearance that adds to the laugh factor a must see
saving silverman is a laughing riot from start to end after many years have i seen such an amazing film with amazing performances jack black stands out as the best guy in the film he ca n't make you stop laughing steve zahn gives an amazing performance as well this laugh riot is a great entertainer for the entire family and a great pick for frineds a must see and a must buy go for it trust me you will laugh your bones out ! !
we rented this movie not expecting too much we like this genre moron movies unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie we had no trouble at all following the plot we just thought this movie was a scream ! lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell what 's not to like if you like this type of movie you will love it ! mac mccaule
i have always loved this movie and was thrilled to find it on dvd at such a reasonable price
it ai n't rocket science an a list star some recognizable character actors a hot blonde with great legs snappy dialogue a wonderful sense of location and just enough violence and action to keep the thing moving dennis quaid plays a generally decent cop ellen barkin plays an uptight internal affairs agent of course they hate each other at first but then fall in love and become a crime solving duo neither barkin nor quaid are the stars they used to be so the big easy is n't watched much anymore thats too bad because this is one of the more intelligent and enjoyable from the
buy it now folks ! you wo n't see new orleans like this again for a long long time the big easy captures the city 's lush and dramatic atmosphere the performances are excellent and the cinematography is beautiful
as many reviewers note new orleans police drama the big easy '' exudes cajun charm and big easy atmosphere enough to make you taste the oyster po'boys and chicory coffee ! but the fabulous capture of local ambience is not in and of itself what makes this opus a choice for every dvd library big easy is a fine police play in and of itself dennis quaid is a sexy young police lieutenant named remy mcswain he 's been a good guy but the toll of little gratuities and favors is adding up can he redeem himself to help equally sexy assistant da ellen barkin solve a police corruption case a supporting cast includes ned beatty john goodman and the absolutely magnificent little role for charles ludlam as attorney lamar parmentel remy oozes oleaginous charm as part of a huge family of cops and firemen that his gator obsession note the props and decor carefully ! just fit so well with the catchy xydeco soundtrack do n't miss this film an overlooked classic of the 80 's !
this colorful and fast moving film from director jim mcbride about an only slightly corrupt cop in the big easy '' and the pretty assistant district attorney sent to investigate the department is filled with cajun spice and atmosphere the lines between right and wrong are blurred like a rainy windshield in this lightning paced and very sexy cop film dennis quaid gives a terrific performance as remy mcswain a second generation cop who sold out early on in his career accepting it as the norm but not letting it hinder him from doing his job when the prim but sexy ellen barkin arrives on the scene in the form of anne osborne he attempts to wine and dine his way out of trouble as the bodies start piling up in an apparent drug war the charged encounters between remy and the shy anne blend seamlessly with some very brutal crime scenes and a lot of new orleans ' music to propel this film at a breezy and very enjoyable pace when remy 's own corruption is exposed their relationship becomes more complicated when he tampers with evidence and gets off but her comment to him that he is no longer one of the 'good guys ' causes him to take a serious look at himself when cops are discovered to be behind all the recent drug trouble the answers will hit far too close to home a very unique cop thriller that manages to maintain a light and breezy ambiance throughout this is one of the most memorable films of its kind its spicy flavor goes down easy and makes you crave more a supporting cast that includes ned beatty john goodman and lisa jane persky offer fine support in this very seductive and one of a kind film you must see pick this one up today
if you like the big easy as much as i do then i think this a good way to renew contact with the crescent city
this film is a drama in the classic sense of the word it begins in order and ends in disorder and it occurs against the backdrop of n'awlins the big easy you can almost hear the nightly raindrops spattering on the greasy sidewalks dennis quaid is a good cop walking the fine line between integrity and corruption playing at the edges too cute by half his winning seductive boyish smile and easy charm make him a perfect foil for the career minded assistant district attorney ellen barkin but the truth is elusive in new orleans things are n't always what they seem and somewhere along the line choices will be made big choices in the big easy someone 's likely to pay the price a big price the film starts out light and breezy but quickly turns dark and sinister when the plot thickens and danger strikes too close to home the leads are engaging and winning the plot is predictable but engaging and the mood is dark like new orleans herself at night in the rain spattering on the greasy sidewalk
a true classic and a definite original for its time starring such movie icons as dennis quaid ellen barkin and ned beaty this is the type of movie anyone could enjoy the big easy follows the life of lieutenant remy mcswaine quaid of the new orleans police department homicide division as he investigates what appears to be an impending gang war starting with a series of murders on some of the most ruthless gangsters in new orleans however assistant district attorney ann osborn barkin sees things differently as she inserts herself into the investigation looking at police corruption being the cause but when they put aside their differences they feel a growing attraction to one another one that allows them to put aside their differences a few times despite their growing relationship ann does n't ease up on trying to uncover the truth about the murders remy feels the same way but he ca n't see why a cop would do all this however his idea of police corruption is different from how the district attorney and internal affairs see it as they catch him accepting a bribe what makes it harder for remy is that he knows it 's illegal but he and many others on such a take consider it a side benefit to being a cop but it 's this incident that damages his relationship with ann almost permanently and it takes many revelations on the murders to bring them back together again this movie is very detailed in portraying the deeds of the new orleans police department that corrupted it for so long it also works to make remy and ann 's relationship believable the mix of a cop with poor judgment and a coy lawyer creates great sparks and it comes off realistic both quaid and barkin have excellent chemistry and definitely display the best of their acting ability barkin works well to show ann struggling with her feelings you can see she really cares about remy but his hand in the corruption weighs heavily upon her mind and quaid falls almost naturally into remy 's role shining his bright smile and showing how much he cares for ann and for his family as well this is a definite must for fans of crime drama but it 's like a mix of genres it 's the type of movie for everyone do n't bother renting it it 's better bought
set in new orleans dennis quaid is a police detective mildly on the take ellen barkin is an insider sent in to investigate the corruption while she is being prim and proper and going by the book quaid becomes neck deep in a murder investigation quaid turns out to be small potatoes compared to who the killers are parts are fairly predictable but on the whole it 's not a bad movie

by 1992 and aladdin 's release disney was riding high with such hits as the little mermaid '' and beauty and the beast '' disney carried on it 's trend with this fun filled was truely a great additiion to the disney cannon because of strenght and subtleties the story is well delivered and blends action and romance briliantly along with comic relief characters that never seem corny or out of place that seemlessnes keeps this film from becoming too sereous or light hearted the animation is strong yet again by this point disney was beginning to experiment with computer animation and what it could do that helped the film imensley the film 's animation style itself is highly stylized but it works perfectly here the music ties it all together and is just as strong as in preveous disney films all these increadable elements come together to form a solid entertaining film it is n't disney greatest of their modern four hits but it holds up nicely and is quite impressive it is definately definately worth owning
first it was the little mermaid then it was beauty and the beast now it 's aladdin another alan menken movie alan menken in my opinion is a genius the songs he writes are absolutely wonderfull aladdin is a story about a boy who finds a lamp and a genie who can make his dreams come true i highly recommand this movie it 's full of adventure comedy and music a great film buy it now
i 've known this movie for a long time but in fact i have n't watched this movie before this special edition was published when one day i saw this dvd was on sale in a book shop suddenly i wanted to watch it then i borrowed a copy of vcd of this movie from a friend and after i watched it i decided to collect the special edition because i wanted to know more about this wonderful movie what attracted me much were the characters and the music why this movie always makes me laugh it is because of the genie i think he is a lively spirited and natural born humorous guy he can change into many different things that are all comical aladdin and princess jasmine are my favorite characters they 're both very bright and a handsome boy and a pretty girl the air around them is romantic and happy when they 're together rajar is a cute character sometimes i really wish that i could have a huge but kind and gentle tiger just like him as a pet while i 'm reviewing a movie i always think much of its music needless to say a whole new world '' is very famous to everyone and i think the pop version is more famous but i love the version in the movie only because it 's more natural and makes me feel that this song is very magical to a real extent loving lea salonga and brad kane 's voices is the principal reason of loving this song lea salonga 's voice is so sweet and pure and her voice can always be associated with jasmine 's image one jump ahead '' is a good song the tune is wonderful the lyric is funny 2 songs that the genie sang are wonderful especially friend like me '' the tableaux of this song in the movie are funny and comical it was so creative ! the bonus features is the most important part in this special edition there are many video that were recorded in the making of aladdin '' included the character creation music composing story editing and so on it makes the journey of aladdin '' more attractive and more magical and there are some music videos in the bonus features and a new song proud of our boy '' it 's wonderful besides some funny games are in the bonus features the games are a little childish to me but your children will love them i think this movie is one of the most magical and wonderful disney classic so its special edition dvd us worth collecting
aladdin is total family entertainment the music is awesome and great voices wonderful to watch other classics not to forget about are mary poppins my fair lady the wizard of oz chitty chitty bang band the first charlie and the chocolate factory the sound of music oliver west side story fiddler on the roof singing in the rain the wiz little mermaid aladdin beauty and the beast grease the king and i oklahoma the music man south pacific my voice students are always asking me for recommendations so i though i 'd post it for all ! we ca n't forget about these great musicals
i watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter just tonight it is supposed to be the story of aladdin from the thousand and one nights '' also known as arabian nights '' the problem is that it deviates from the true story in many ways for example there is no ring '' or its genie in the movie at all there are additions such as the monkey turned elephant as well in fact there are so many other deviations that it would take me a whole day to mention however to be fair this is not unique to this movie most movies disney in particular tend to rewrite master pieces resulting in vastly modified stories now this modified story is perfectly ok by itself and my daughter loved it there are some clear attempts to make the story appealing to adults but then it helps to have parents interested ! the songs are good and kids love them as for the politically correct change from the first disney release replacing the arab stereotyping it is not unique disney also replaced a particularly offensive stereotyping of africans part of fantasia in their dvd offer my feeling is that we could all do with less racism and if it means removing offensive scenes and language we should do so besides this movie was never the real story anyway and the '' part hardly contributed anything after all the value of the movie is not in how many people it hurts my advise is if you want the real story please read the book on the whole this is a great movie just not the real story
one of the better disney classics maybe the second most entertaining after the lion king this is the best plotlines that disney has come up with after the lion king overview aladdin is a poor street rat and the hero he falls in love with princess jasmine but evil jafar is trying to become the sultan and the most powerful person in the world aladdin gets the geni and must try to get the girl and defeat jafar why it is good funny this movie is funny ! ! ! ! ! geni is robin williams iago is gilford gottfried these two are sooooooo hilarious ! ! ! ! i 'm an adult and after years since i first watched it is still hilarious my 2 year old neice also laughed her head off i think that it is one of the funniest disney movies the comedy is perfect ! ! ! plotline and drama this is an amazing plotline it does n't slow down there is no part where the movie drags or you start to feel like the drama is just going on it moves at a awesome pace where you just keep watching the story is great its original not dull songs the music is not as great as the lion king but it does n't take away from the story or slow it down i mean there are no musical numbers that the story line stops and the characters start singing the music helps drives the plots and is funny to the better songs is the classic a whole new world '' and prince ali '' entertaining my verdict this is the top echelon of disney movie it truly is a classic it is entertaining for adults as well as children its funny the plot does not drag on and get dull music does not take away from the movie this is an amazing movie ! ! ! ! ! i love it ! ! !
while disney 's early animated films were seen as masterpieces snow white cinderella sleeping beauty peter pan there was a long time when disney 's animated features were met with mediocre box office receipts after the sword in the stone the black cauldron and oliver and company i 'm not saying they 're bad just poorly received in theaters there was a rennaissance or second coming of disney films starting with the little mermaid and going on to beauty and the beast which remains the only animated film to be nominated for the best picture oscar and probably the only one ever due to the creation of the best animated feature category aladdin came soon after telling the story of the poor young boy who found a genie and got three wishes aladdin is a first for most animated films due to its inclusion of pop culture references more on that later aladdin is a young thief living in the fictional agrabah the tale took place in medieval baghdad but due to the gulf war this detail was changed he and his abu who is a monkey must steal in order to survive but in doing so must avoid the royal guards who police the marketplace one day he runs into a woman who is about to lose her hand for stealing an apple and giving it to a young child who is starving he saves her and takes her to his home to hide from the law it turns out that the girl is really jasmine the daughter of the sultan she ran away from the palace in order to see what life outside the walls was really like the sultan needs to marry her off to a prince the law dictates that she must marry a prince and she must be married by a given birthday she is taken back to the palace and aladdin is arrested for kidnapping '' the princess little do either of them know that jafar the sutan 's vizier is plotting against the sultan and hopes to get his hands on a lamp which houses a genie he needs a diamond in the rough '' in order to enter the cave of wonders and retrieve the lamp and when he learns that aladdin is the boy he 's looking for he has the guards sieze him which happened when he was with jasmine though he tells jasmine that aladdin has been beheaded for his crimes he later disguises himself as a prisoner and helps aladdin get out of the cell he brings aladdin to the cave and tells him that in exchange for the lamp aladdin will receive a reward beyond his wildest dreams though due to abu 's greed aladdin and abu get trapped in the cave along with the lamp and a magic flying carpet aladdin accidentally releases the genie of the lamp who promises him three wishes and a way out of the cave this is where the pop culture references begin the genie who is expertly voiced by robin williams spouts off references impressions and jokes at a mile a minute my favorite of which being a jack nicholson impression he does ed sullivan pinnochio arnold schwarzenneger and numerous others anyway from there aladdin wishes to become a prince so that he can marry jasmine little does he know that jasmine has no interest in marrying a prince despite what the law dictates at first she is upset that yet another vapid prince has come to win her but he eventually wins her over by taking her on a ride on his carpet across the world it wins her too quickly to seem real but it will have to work due to pacing issues after that she agrees to marry him this leads aladdin to reconsider his promise to free the genie with his third wish because he fears that he will need his services and help in the future meanwhile jafar tries to find a way to get rid of aladdin and eventually he steals the lamp away turning agrabah into hell on earth while there may not have been any twists it was fairly aladdin is a very enjoyable movie the animation is great while not as revolutionary as it was back in 1992 it is still good and the songs are some of disney 's best especially a whole new world furthermore it can serve as an interesting study in freedom for older viewers being free and feelings of was a major theme throughout the movie and even if the older viewers do n't like film analysis there is still a lot there to enjoy aladdin is a great example of how a kids ' movie can be for everyone maybe not as good an example as the incredibles it is fun funny and very well done overall
this is the absolute best documentary i have seen to date on corruption and the brainwashing of the public with the help of the and gutless media this film is required viewing for the intelligent half of the population as well as the less intelligent half that identifies with their leader to quote writer norman mailer
is other dimwits ' idea how the world should be no wonder it 's getting worse how can anybody believe someone who having been sworn by the bible deems his first duty is to fight those who have been sworn by the coran or any other superstitious literature is beyond me in the end the only winner will be stupidity blinded by superstition for a while american governments ' politics were submitted only by rulings from united fruits ford or petrol moguls now microsoft has also power to crush competition by blackmailing governments under the guile of unemployment which is very untrue since they got much more people losing jobs than those who might lose theirs in redmont if mr gates was not above the laws and now america got a new crusader who wants to go back 10 centuries just look at was is taking place in texas since they feel having support in obscurantist ruling they now want to reenact the monkey trial '' in 1925 opposing sheer blind stupidity against examination even if he regards himself as the new burning bush '' and believes he 's god 's speaker do n't beat around the bush just trash it if you do n't want the whole world burning ! ! ! straitjacket and cold showers should be
although my panasonic dvd was unable to read '' this disc thus viewed it om my computor a minor inconvienience i found this to be a serious and documentary one that we all should see and share with everyone we know where fahrenheight '' was for entertainment as well as information this french created a documentary that delves more into the bush family history which is important to know in order to better understand where is coming from
this film is a caustic expos of the bush administration and their machinations leading up to the invasion of iraq william karel interviews numerous individuals from the cia advisors to the president and hans blix the weapons inspector revealing a calculated propaganda campaign to sway public opinion to support the iraqi war the wmd question is explored at some length and the fact that gwb vice president cheney and colin powel knew full well that there was no connection between saddam hussein and al quada that there certainly was not enough evidence to prove that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction intentionally lying to the american people what is telling confirming the bush administration lied about saddam hussein is a comment made by the president in a cabinet meeting a year after the invasion stating he knew there was no connection between al quada and the iraqi regime this of course begs the question if this administration knew there was no connection between al quada and saddam hussein and there was no solid proof that this regime possessed weapons of mass destruction why was the country invaded killing hundreds of american soldiers and thousands of iraqi men women and children this film also reveals this administrations incestuous connection to corporations in the oil industry and responsible for building the war machine halliburton vice president is an ex ceo lockheed martin cheney is on the board of directors kellogg brown and root a subsidiary of halliburton have exclusive contracts in the reconstruction '' of war torn iraq the central '' is the saudi arabians who spend billions of dollars in washington dc through various lobby groups more than anyone else strangely the bush family and the bin laden family have been in business together and continue a lucrative relationship to this day as the bin laden 's and the saudi 's were the only people allowed to fly out of the country during shows that the administration at least has enough sense not to bite the hand that feeds them this is a brave film that reveals evidence of corruption in the highest echelons of government what is mind boggling is that ten years ago these men would have been dragged in front of senate committees investigated and brought to justice for lying to the american people but it seems no one can touch them why the world according to bush is a serious film without the fanfare and unnecessary hype it presents the evidence and leaves it to the viewer to decide a telling film of power and corruption
this documentary will open your eyes to the true nature of evil and tyranny when your tired of being distracted by martha stewart michael jackson and runaway brides turn your attention to whats really important the morally shameful and downright criminalistic policies and actions undertaken by our president '' and his hawkish administration corruption runs deep and wide and the scariest part is that most americans remain shockingly silent wake up america watch this dvd
it 's amazing with all the docu 's that have been made documenting the presidency of the texacutioner how anyone can focus in harder and more precise than what has already been done this film does it ca n't be explained anymore plainly than this it can not be put anymore than this this speaks clearly to all with ears i can not for the life of me understand why so many people support this oaf this crooked oaf who exactly supports putting more money in the credit card companies wallets who are these people who wish to not make every effort to cure disease through research what kind of human actually supports the writing of an energy policy by oil companies what kind of americans are for the dismantling of the judicial system the very system that keeps every american protected from being told what to think see hear and say by any crazy minority who actually wishes to let the federal government keep states from votes cast in a presidential election who exactly wishes for the tax code to be slanted heavily in favor of those who are already more than comfortable financially than 90 of the rest of the public the asleep at the switch bush supporters who have let the government do their thinking for them that 's who the bush supporters who are so intent on keeping power that they will sacrifice the safety of themselves and their countrymen to keep power the same people who voted for bush for compassionate '' governing the same who voted for bush to bring integrity '' to the white house where are these people today fast asleep ignoring the world around them and taking solace in stupid yellow ribbon magnets on their suv 's and wrapping themselves in the flag feeling safe with the knowledge that they hate us for our freedom '' they are asleep in the warm light of only 5 people owning all the media which is basically everything you see on tv hear on the radio and read in magazines ! 5 people working together to keep the status quo of making sure to not rock the money boat long enough for the people to wake up and see the unethical bahaviouir of these powers that be fighting tooth and nail to stay on top and keep the money flowing in we 're being sold a bill of goods and the american public as a whole are blissfully unaware and we like it that way we 're ripe for the picking watch the movie if you disagree with this these are the salad days for you then you are the 10 of the entire population of the us and screw you jerk off ! you 're nothing more than a lucky lottery winner you work no harder than anyone else
there are plenty of films and books around if you only shall see or read one this must be the best pick i like michael moore very much but he is not really a political heavyweighter and i do n't think fahrenheit is his best work it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book stupid white men '' for instance it is more like two or three movies in one william karel is a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary but what a documentary it has turned out to be very disturbing insights from informed sources among them former it is not usual to hear such plain speaking from people in high places '' just a few years after the events this film is perhaps not as entertaining as fahrenheit but far more informative
four years ago when this country stupidly sent a corrupt hideous half witted frat boy by the name of george bush to the oval office to the white house we effectively pointed the proverbial loaded pistol at our own collective head on election night 2004 make no mistake about it we pulled the trigger if after viewing this film you are not outraged you did n't pay attention tom degan goshen new yor
julia roberts gave a brilliant performance here as erin brockovich a single mother who 's temper is about as short as her skirts when she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of ed masry albert finney the lawyer that lost her case after reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in hinkley california julia gives such an effortless performance here that she does n't even appear to be acting everything is so natural and that can be said for her cast mates as well albert finney is brilliant as the lawyer who 's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee 's personality he perfectly compliments her in every scene they share and the same can be said for aaron eckhart who plays george erin 's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she 's always needed and never received this film if nothing else is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors but acting aside the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired
this 2000 release stars julia roberts and albert finney as much as i enjoyed pretty woman that performance does n't compare to the excellent work julia did portraying erin brockovich years ago albert finney gave an excellent tom jones classic movie not the singer portrayal i 'm a paralegal and relate strongly to this movie all the research and paper processing the concern for clients the waits hoping verdicts are delivered favorably it 's a true story making it even more interesting erin is a divorced mother of 3 just trying to make ends meet she has a personal injury case after a vehicular accident and is represented by the attorney who after her case is lost at trial becomes her boss she kinda forces herself into his payroll while working at the attorney 's office erin happens upon the beginnings of a major class action suit against a water company that has been knowingly poisoning the residents of a town with chromium a rust inhibitor nasty stuff that chromium when ingested will erin and her boss persevere for their clients the erin brockovich plays a bit part in the movie she 's a waitress at a diner
there have been emblematic films that plainly justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment but few times we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness constancy and dedication like this one we should be back to the times if silkwood or the china syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions on the other hand of the coin and i must confess i have never been a special fan of roberts she displayed by far the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the academy award that year one more thing in order to the fairness i would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream '' and that i keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between barbara streisand and vanessa redgrave in 1967 where the difference in what acting concerns was even major excellent edition and magisterial direction of steven soderbergh
when i first saw this movie i thought it was fictitious so i thought it was boring but then when i found out it was real i was really impressed i 'm not really sure how they were able to document it since at the time julia roberts was a nobody i also did n't know that she used to work at a lawfirm i mean i 'm not really sure how documentaries work but why did they decided to make a documentary about julia roberts they could n't have known what she was going to discover anyway i 'm really really glad that they did because it was really amazing and touching and look at all the people who became actors because of this movie ! wow wow wow wow wow wow
watching julia roberts play a jobless skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant might make you wonder what she really thinks though erin brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own while not unique in this film or for this actress its particular noticeable in the contrasts here roberts is the only true welfare queen '' that ever lived the queen of hollywood playing a destitute single mother giving a chance for the common american '' or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there to live vicariously through her does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism as if we the peons of life must watch a film like this to lift us up from our little lives '' to borrow a quote from jean hagen cynical or empathetic erin brockovich at least manages to deliver when it takes flight from reality it is entertaining and when it hits home on everyday realities it is deeply troubling a sharp reverse in gender roles is deeply evident with the pedagogically talented boyfriend watching the kids while brockovich goes off to pursue the substance of the film once this logistical arrangement is established the boyfriend 's screen time drops off dramatically and it might seem at times that we are only to be reminded later that oh yeah they still exist how dull but that is an unfair interpretation brockovich 's family gets more screen time and substance than the families of the protagonists of any other typical hollywood thriller would get ordinarily we dont see the wife and kids unless they are in physical danger or unless a sex scene is about to happen the movie is conscious of its own gender reversal and thrusts the challenge of balancing work and family into the light tackling the awkward compromises indeed there are very deep though somewhat implicit family values dominating the film and its to the credit of the scriptwriters that they were able to mix legal thriller and family drama as if they themselves were working parents trying to balance work and home certainly a unique film
what makes julia roberts ' oscar winning performance as erin brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners charlize theron monster nicole kidman the hours and halle berry monster 's ball roberts did n't hide behind makeup or to win her trophy she utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy but somewhat tawdry young woman who brings down a corporate giant roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before she is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous albert finney as her lawyer boss and friend aaron eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship marg helgenberger as the client that starts the ball rolling and conchata ferrell as the krispy kreme '' office worker who she spars with director stephen soderbergh an oscar winner for traffic wisely keeps the focus on brockovich 's determination and her single motherhood dilemma it 's a very entertaining and movie a showcase for one of hollywood 's modern icons
this is a great story which has been wrapped in an entertaining and well acted by all this is julia 's best work in my opinion albert finney is always a favorite and his role here is absolutely charming i would highly recommend this film
julia roberts delivers my second favorite performance my first being pretty woman well worth the oscar i love that scene where the guy asks her for her number saucy julia is at her best here in a story that touches you in a fundamental way and shows that the determination of one person can make a difference inspiring ! !
this noam chomsky speech on dvd is as usual enlightening mr chomsky documents the facts the truths and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years this speech and the bonus interview with the harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively believe '' what we are told by our government rather than seeking to know '' the facts or simply ask wait is that statement true '' mr chomsky explains patiently that facts are important words and meaning can not be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners
informative powerful challenging stimulating truthful stronly recommended to those who are still willing to use common sense and critical thinking when evaulation past and current events
i found it a bit difficult to follow this lecture by mr chomsky it required that i really pay attention and concentrate on what he says he is extremely understated with his speech so if you do n't take your time and really listen you can miss out on the point he is trying to make however when you take the time and truly listen to mr chomsky 's lectures they blow you away with the simple accurate info he allows you to see you start to see yourself as mentally inept while you ask yourself my god that is so simple why did n't i see or think of that '' he really is that well thought out lecture by mr chomsky that really packs a punch and does n't mince words he cleary respects his audience 's intelligence and you can learn a lot from this man
a note get the newer eight dollar version ! after reading several of the reviews it became apparent that i should write one there are flaws i see with some of the reviews written i will address them after a quick summary and analysis if you have n't heard of chomsky read any of his books or any of his appearances this probably is n't for you i point you to manufacturing consent the quintessential chomsky dvd about american culture media indoctrination etc whether or not you like chomsky this is a good dvd i 'm not going to summarize it 's already been done but for the price this is a good deal whether you plan to write a paper on or just want to hear about the state sponsored international terror hypocrisy and moral issues in america 's past and present and the future implications of them for eight dollars this is a great buy the q a portion of the extras with fifteen questions is alone worth the cost the q a is an hour with questions from both people attending at kennedy school of govt harvard and people at mit they ask poignant questions with inspired responses from noam now to address comments by reviewers if you ca n't handle watching something without constant cuts mind numbing music and lots of hollywood glitz this is n't for you if you ca n't handle or a college lecture this is n't for you if you like chomsky and are willing to watch something that is n't the slightest bit reminiscent of the mtv beach house like uh what 's it called a documentary ! then check this out most people outside of college and the scholarly community are unaware of or do n't think about many of the points chomsky argues in his books lectures and public appearances for that reason many people will dismiss what chomsky says outright however if you are open to things that go against the general american consensus '' then take a look at this this dvd looks at some of america 's past and present forays in international terrorism chomsky presents many well documented facts he demonstrates his sources and makes a statement similar to check it out and make up your own mind '' that 's exactly what i suggest you do i suggest you weigh the and see if you think this is worth it in my opinion for this amount this can be a great addition to anyone 's collection of doc 's a note get the newer eight dollar version !
this is about an actual event carried in the 20 years ago it 's about a high school math teacher jaime escalante in a barrio school teaching his students to overcome low expectations racism and bigotry to become the top calculus class in the country i 'm a teacher myself and met escalante back when the film came out actor ed olmos plays escalante perfectly you 're watching the real stuff here
i am a math teacher myself so i have always had a special interest in this film i think it is very well done and it is very inspirational however for anyone who wants to know the true story of what happened with escalante and his students purchase the book escalante the best teacher in america '' by jay mathews the film leads you to believe that escalante took students who did n't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score on the ap calculus test this is far from what really happened escalante spent years developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of calculus there is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film the movie portrays it as the testing company ets accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at garfield high school could n't have possibly known the material the true story is that some answers on the ap tests from garfield were noticeably similar about 12 students made the same exact errors on one particular problem and that is what made ets suspicious so once again a well done film and while is it based on a true story '' it is far from a true story
i received the dvd in a timely manner the quality of the dvd was good i have had good service from amazon overall it was a good experience and a good product
i enjoy this movie very much and is great to deal wit
this video provides an honest report on the trials of high school students as well as the ability to overcome racial profiling a great resource for teachers whom have cultural diversity in their classroom
i enjoyed most of this movie and applaud its central message that kids and people rise to meet expectations and that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are not necessarily lacking in intelligence but only in resources and opportunities however i found the movie not entirely satisfying because it does not really show just how jaime escalante turned these kids around other than being creative charismatic and persistent as a former teacher myself of high school kids from a similar background as the ones portrayed in this movie i know firsthand that what escalante achieved is not impossible but it 's not quite so clean and simple as shown here but is extremely hard grueling work that often entails breaking through a lot of the students ' ingrained patterns and applying a lot of painstaking coercion the director ramon menendez seems to present a fairly sanitized and glib version that glosses over a lot of the underlying social problems that are endemic to the urban poor while sometimes relying on some stock movie cliches the tough guy who 's really a softie at heart the big seemingly dumb lunk in short stand and deliver '' lacks the kind of rawness grit and ballsiness that could 've made it more than just another triumphant and movie it could have been a movie that asks questions instead of spooning out pat answers it 's too bad a real master like martin scorsese did not direct this one
i used this movie as part of my hispanic heritage month october lesson in the classroom we did a study of jaime escalante and salvador dali the children really enjoyed the movie we just watched the classroom scenes teacher 's version of editing for content and time while i explained what was happening my class loved it and so did i
superbly directed by menndez for pbs 's american playhouse stand and deliver '' is a cut above most motivational storytelling because it bypasses sentimentality in favor of a more complex authentic tone olmos is a marvel as escalante a brilliant but idiosyncratic educator and he deservedly nabbed an oscar nomination among a dynamic supporting cast lou diamond phillips also impresses as the troubled youth who faces a choice between gang life and academic glory
this is a great feel good '' movie but hollywood altered the story for theatricality in the film a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up in one year to become calculus winners there is a good backgroud article at http that describes how the process took ten years so that the original group of students were not the ones who passed the ap calculus exam jaime escalante played by edward james olmos of miami vice '' fame actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time reaching back to the junior high school that fed garfield high the way that the movie was done however allows the viewers to see some of the processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them especially their parents remarkably at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under escalante 's leadership that 's 400 fewer future employees for kfc and macdonald 's as escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student so tough guys do n't do math tough guys deep fry chicken for a living '' eventually it appears that the education establishment won out driving the brilliant teacher out and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future the idea is great that no student should be regarded as hopeless and that all should be encouraged to try but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows
stand and deliver is one of my favorite movies it 's the story of a man who begins teaching at a high school in the slums of los angeles expecting to teach computer science when he arrives what he instead finds is that there is not computer department and he 's stuck teaching basic math to a bunch of social misfits the beginning of this movie sets the stage wonderfully by showing us the kind of people who inhabit the city as he drives through it on the way to the first day of school when he arrives at the school we see the students in their natural environment and a rough one it is what is a teacher to do the protagonist of this story jaime escalante is a wonderful example of what can happen when a person chooses to adapt to certain environments and not adapt to others when he 's given the task of educating a group of kids that includes some scary type looking kids instead of acting like a teacher he acts tough right back reminding them that they 're in his domain yet when he 's brought into a room with the other teachers and school staff he goes against the grain when the school 's head advisor tells the principle that everyone is doing their best he immediately says that he 's not and when she tells the principle that escalante is asking too much of his students he boldly tells her that the students will rise to the expectations of their teacher this alone makes the movie interesting but what adds even more drama to situation is the fact that each and every student in the class escalante teaches has their own peer pressures to deal with some students have unsavory friends who would laugh at their taking a class seriously some of the students have boyfriends or girlfriends who do n't understand their sudden interest in school and some of the students have to deal with parents who do n't understand why their education should come before taking care of their own family as the movie progresses escalante announces to the board that he wants to teach calculus to his best students despite the fact that the students had n't studied any of the prerequisites for the course naturally this requires them to study through their summer break and then six days a week with extra hours ! in any teen environment there is always peer pressure but what happens when positive peer pressure conflicts with negative peer pressure when our type angel first starts the class he is hesitant to get involved because of his rough and tough friends when escalante singles him out however the pressure of the teacher is greater than the pressure of his friends '' over time this has a tremendous effect on him towards the end of the movie he 's riding with his friend and starts acting stupid and gets his friend a traffic ticket when the guy becomes angry with him and wants to fight angel just walks away what does this say about him as a person to me it shows that whether he likes it or not he no longer belongs with his old associates he 's now turning into a responsible individual as i said before at the outset of the movie escalante is the one who is thrown into pressure groups he could become just like the other teachers or just become uncaring like the kids in his class were initially what he does instead is nothing short of a miracle he uses his understanding of human nature and the natural tendency of people to work better when their thoughts are united to his advantage his class becomes its own little world a club for the elite the strong and the brave and early on when one of the students refuses to take a test the other students quickly turn against her and ridicule her she then quickly becomes obedient and gets back to work positive peer pressure was too much for her the harder the students are pushed and the more is expected of them the more they feel like a team how can i forget the scene where a student says that the rest of the class will have a better chance of making it without him the driving force of the scholastic miracle and this movie is escalante as he himself said if the students do n't have the desire he will give it to them and that 's exactly what he did he made them want to succeed he made them have the motivation to keep pushing and striving for higher and higher goals basically he educated them on how to be successful and individuals people who normally would n't have anything to do with each other computer nerds homeboys and rockers all were united by their desire to achieve and make themselves into something great they pushed themselves harder than anyone had ever done in their lives and when push came to shove they were successful in every way every single student escalante taught passed the exam for college credit every one motivation is a powerful thing and sometimes if you do n't already have it an extraordinary person can give it too you everyone should see this movie
what 's nice about this exercise video is that you do n't realize how much time goes by ! ! ! you do a 40 min workout in what feels like 20 min ! ! the women are all very in shape but i found that actually motivated me ! ! i wanted their abs ! ! at first i thought the salsa dancing would be difficult but it was actually pretty easy ! ! i have absolutely no coordination and by the end of this video it actually makes you feel like a sexy dancer ! ! something i never thought i would feel ! ! overall great video when you are just getting back into the exercise scene !
i do n't usually call any form af exercise fun so i bought this video hoping that dancing my way to fitness might work for me i really like this video because even though i am not coordinated and i have no sense of rhythm i can actually do this video and enjoy myself in the process it took me about 3 times doing the workout before i was comfortable with the steps but even if you mess up the steps you are still getting a good workout maybe exercisers that are used to an hour of heart pumping high impact aerobics might find this video a little easy and maybe authentic salsa dancers might think that the moves are not true latin dance but if you are like me and want a fun fast easy to follow video this is a great choice
this dvd was fun to work out to i enjoyed the music selection
this is a good workout video to get your heart pumping without you even realizing it you have to get past the campy set and the teacher to really enjoy i recommend it
giselle is so cute and energetic it just keeps you going the workout did n't really seem very much like dancing it really was just a fun cardio workout fun ! fun
i utilize this tape on those days that are n't scheduled off '' days but on which i really have a hard time gathering the oomph for my usual high intensity workouts i do break a sweat but i have dance experience and can embellish moves as needed in general i love dance but despise dance workouts boring and often annoying but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate further she breaks the video down into so if you wanted to you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music she provides counts mostly 8 but some 4 16 throughout the video the background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs which is a nice change finally if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements this workout will be much less effective so if you have n't danced before and are n't used to posture and breathing keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout
i liked this film a lot the big flaw in this release can be summarized in one word disney it was not the name '' american actors i found distracting it was the lines the writers chose for the voiceovers in typical current disney fashion the script contains colloquialisms that are so up to date they are already dated the engineer character is also given superfluous decidedly feminist lines that are absent in the japanese version if i may rely on subtitles for that evaluation on first viewing the english version i noted that the curtis character appeared to be a caricature of an american as seen through a japanese or italian person 's eyes comparing the japanese version i find that disney injected a lot of explicit ugly american into the curtis character having curtis deriding the french language or shouting the ridiculous here comes the american '' both absent in the japanese version curtis is plenty boastful and arrogant and tall in the japanese version and anyone but a small child would observe he 's being portrayed in a certain way disney did not help the presentation of this character by laying out his personality for consumption at the fourth grade reading level it is very typical of recent disney to spell things out and ruin them after the movie writer skillfully wove the same message into the script well enough that anyone over the age of 10 with a 90 or better iq could figure it out on the plus side everything said so far porco 's initial negotiations with the engineer are brilliant english or japanese and the portrayals of motion and old mechanical airplanes make the movie intensely visually interesting i give the japanese version a 5 and the version a 3 2.8 is more like it luckily this product contains both split the difference and call it a 4
i must say that this is not my favorite miyazaki film but it definitely caught my interest and my imagination still as this great director always does i would not say porco rosso should be your first miyazaki experience but it 's definitely one that i 'm proud to have in my collection
you can feel that they makes a great work of research the places the things the people it 's incredible for all milan it 's like the real 's for these reason that i like miyazaki 's works it 's a pleasure relax yourself with amzing tales and fantastic draws
i do n't know anime but i know what i like or do i the idea of an animated feature about a pig flying an aeroplane sounded a little silly but i actually found porco rosso '' pretty enjoyable the film more or less is about an expatriate italian pilot of the who has the head of a pig thanks to a strange experience many years ago he 's a bounty hunter who battles air pirates and rescues hostages even though it 's a little tetchy and in need of a tune up his red aircraft is beautiful and suits him very nicely the pirates want him grounded and so do the italian fascists unless of course he decides to work for them but no porco would rather be a pig than a fascist '' and continues to fly the skies solo feeling sorry for himself in a gruff quiet sort of way that all may change soon though i 'm sure that this film would n't have been half as nice to watch if director hayao miyazaki was n't so passionate about aviation and the studio ghibli team was n't so passionate about motion though it is n't as colourful and strange as say spirited away '' it is a beautiful looking film and has miyazaki 's signature style all over it it 's a film a more light hearted and sparse than his others i reckon there 's not an awful lot that happens and when it 's often rather silly especially with the air pirates my brother was in stitches at some parts actually the english dub features michael keaton as porco i thought it was him but i was n't sure until i checked the credits does a decent job catches the surliness of the but makes him likeable and friendly too it 's good for what it is light entertainment and worth a look for anime fans but if you 're just getting into hayao miyazaki i 'd recommended seeing a film like spirited away '' or castle of cagliostro '' first
1992 's porco rosso tells the tale of marco a human wwi pilot cursed to become half pig marco or porco spends his days fighting against sea pirates and evading capture by the italian secret police as well as visiting the lovely gina owner of the swanky hotel adriano brash american newcomer curtis clearly in the mold of actor ronald reagan agrees to fight marco for honour and shoots his plane down a love triangle between curtis marco and gina only serves to complicate matters marco must sneak into italy for repairs where he meets fio a talented and beautiful engineer the two work together to rebuild marco 's plane into a sleek sophisticated fighting machine and an brawl ensues as the pirates fight for fio 's honour and hand in marriage marco is now torn between the two women gina wife of a former comrade and old flame and the young enthusiastic fio the ending is left open but with clues '' porco rosso '' is the first of miyazaki hayao 's fables aimed squarely at adults rather than children there is a lot of smoking and alcohol comments towards women and comic violence miyazaki had the chance to spend an entire film dedicated to his love of flying and the attention to detail of the many planes in the movie is amazing i did n't like this as well as other miyazaki classics like kiki '' and nausicaa '' but it was an enjoyable romp nonetheless
during the first few minutes of porco rosso '' i was thinking 'okay this is it 's good but i do n't think it 's exactly gon na be spirited away '' or naussicaa '' ' i should have known better it is different it 's not spirited away '' or any other ghibli movie before or since but it is in its own bizarre way just as good studio ghibli seems to be incapable of delivering anything short of true excellence the title character is a grumpy bipedal pig who flies a world war airplane in the mediterranean in the years between the two world wars once human porco has adopted an air of disinterested apathy to cover his feelings but he finds himself drawn to a group of people in italy after his plane is shot down by a rival pilot rendering porco unable to make a living protecting transport and passenger ships from pirates some of the most gloriously incompetent pirates imaginable by the way porco rosso ' is suitable viewing for the kiddies but may be in general enjoyed more by an older audience in addition to the soaring air battles and climax there 's plenty of romance dry humor and subtle political commentary regardless it has the ghibli charm and is likely to have something for almost everyone a truly movie ask youself this when was the last time you saw a movie about a trenchcoat goggles and pig piloting a brightly painted red airplane and fighting sky pirates and another jewel in the glorious ghibli crown
one of moriyama 's best featuring first rate animation story and dialogue the fist fight scene probably makes this film better for the crowd but the real audiences for this masterpiece are adults who appreciate beautiful animation heros and the sounds of radial aircraft engines accurate details rivaling those of herge 's famous tintin comic book series make this a jewel the english language version has a few voices that could have carried a little more believable emotion but this is a very minor complaint and is something most viewers will probably not even notice until the third or fourth viewing porco rosso deserves a top ranking in any movie collection
porco rosso is by far my favorite miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the theme althrough kids might not fully understand the movie none of the content is actually mature '' enough that a whole family can not enjoy this movie together the music and scores are fambulous as usual since miyazaki and hisaishi combined both their expertise together flawlessly i admit i 'm the pickiest person when it comes to voices matching personalities but i really ca n't complain about the dubbing for this movie it is actually enjoyable and believable as opposed to some dubs for other miyazaki movies the script follows the original quite closely that makes me happy good job ! the only thing i had a problem with was that they did not use the original for les temps des cerises '' and the ending theme i liked the voice of the original singer tokiko kato more so then the one they picked do n't know who but the new one is not bad either many might think that the ending is a bit of a blur but that 's miyazaki 's signature watch end credit of my neighbor totoro and nausicaa of valley of the wind miyazaki never does sequel of his films which i fully agree with since somethings are better left unsaid and left to the imagination which is a theme in most of his movies but he does give hints throughout the movie on the ending as for the actual ending figure it out for yourself
have watched a couple of times and the wit of this movie stands out the quote about being pig rather than facist still makes me smil
the acting was decent for the young guys and the movie while predictable was very enjoyable to watch i would buy this on dvd some of the scenes were actually laugh out loud funny
teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little german film 'sommersturm ' or 'summer storm ' and the result is a set of that tumble young people all the time first sexual attraction the ambiguity of close friendships the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers director marco kreuzpaintner and writer with thomas bahmann set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate two teams from bavaria one of boys and the other of girls take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from berlin a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys the bavarian boys ' crew team is lead by two friends tobi robert stadlober and achim kostja ullmann and while their friendship is strong tobi is discovering that his feelings for achim go far deeper the two share stories about their girlfriends anke and beautiful alicja and sandra miriam morgenstern who head the girl 's crew team at the summer camp tobi 's feelings for achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding leo marlon kittel and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover the manner in which tobi comes out to his team and to achim is the very tender of the story the storm raging in tobi as well as in other members of the team settles into the aftermath some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching the director seems to be telling us that the 'first experience ' whether that is gay or straight is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling the cast does well there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure for a young director only 29 years old and this is his fifth film kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future grady harp september 06
listen to the breathing cute caring and collected at one with himself the out '' and 'leo ' a wondrous marlon kittel so knows who he is and so knows where 'tobi ' an amazingly expressive robert stadlober is coming from tobi is so lucky to have leo for his '' and speaking of that time in most all our lives this film gives us a '' gay love scene which tops all others in the lengths to which it goes at least in a movie with such youthful characters it 's tender and caring at the same time it 's feverish and arousing just listen to the breathing if you think there can be any intensity and missing from what kittel and stadlober bring to us in their love making scene you 'd have to be deaf as well as blind again just listen to the breathing to the sounds of catching breaths and sighs '' or turn up your system will ya ! would you say these guys were caught up in what they were doing or not while the film 's main relationship between tobi and achim has probably been a one of fun and childhood for one another we watch as things begin to go terribly wrong when another kind of love '' starts rearing up as part of this pair 's growing up we come to see that a straight achim is too free and easy with his feelings to be just a friend to someone who 's now discovering he is gay and in love achim of course is not be blamed for being who he 's been all along it 's just that so much of who he is becomes misinterpreted by tobi i like this movie for its credible acting so much i 'd award it an easy ps if anything at all disappointed in this work it was the director 's failure to give us at film 's end a '' scene in which leo and tobi could say their goodbyes it 's inconceivable to me that leo so deeply affectionate of tobi would fail to take the time to do so obviously we can expect little to come of their relationship since a seemingly younger tobi has a goodly amount of growing up and finding himself yet to do however i think of as being very aware of what he owes to leo 's help in making him much more comfortable with who he is he just would n't have departed without a to leo that would have been important for us to see pps director marco kreuzpaintner sure gets the teen angst '' thing right pulling an awful lot of it out of his young cast but then at 25 or so when shooting he 's only about 5 years older than they looking at his elsewhere it 's easy to see how he himself could have handily assumed one of these attractive young player 's roles
this is by far one of these best films i have seen since beautiful thing '' released in 1996 and one of the best films of any kind that i have watched since crash '' you will laugh out loud and cry as you feel the agony tobi endures while coming to terms with his sexuality tobi played flawlessly by robert stadlober is the leader of his rowing team and looked up to by his teammates for leadership when his team is up against another rowing team comprised of an team his inner feelings are realized tobi deals with his feelings and love for his best friend achim and eventually deals with the complications of coming out to him all the while dealing with confused emotions for his girlfriend and a new boy he meets on the opposing team the film is genuine and goes with the painful emotions most younger people must face when trying to understand their sexuality this story is real ! and proves once again that we truly can not help who we fall in love with love is about following your heart it 's about people not the sex of the individual 's involved the movie hails from germany and is in german with english subtitles even with having to read the film to understand it the talent of the young actors shines through not only was i impressed by the story even the movies scenes and settings were delightful kudos to here ! films genius products and liberation entertainment for producing this movie it 's a shame hollywood usa ca n't or does n't have the courage to produce this quality and style of film
summer storm is certainly one of the finer coming out films the cast is excellent and the portayals have an emotional honesty that is often lacking in gay cinema however there are flaws that keep this from being a film some times the director chooses to avoid conversation and confrontation that would have added to the story some shots are with symbolism finally the lead character is a selfish one and never apologizes for the emotional and physical pain he causes this though is much like real life and so is a sad element that was probably intended otherwise a film worthy of being on any gay man 's shelf
this film was significant in germany because robert stadlober is a popular young actor and band member there whose coming out in the character of tobi was unsettling certainly kostja ullmann as achim his buddy and secret love is cute enough to win many hearts and his pretend love interest alicja as anke is sweet and beautiful enough to convince nearly anyone that being gay is not a lifestyle choice when another rowing team bold enough to call themselves the queerstrokes which actually exists shows up tobi gets to see the spectrum of gay characters from manly malte to effeminate nils and marlon kittel as leo sure takes in an eyeful of tobi as he bides his time seeking refuge from a raging storm and from an increasingly stormy relationship with achim in a closed hostel building brings some closer together and drives others apart there is n't much new for american audiences in that there have been a number of equally well done coming out films here but summer storm rings true because it is at least partly autobiographical for director and writer marco kreuzpaintner and stadtlober and ullmann certainly have chemistry together to spare as mates in fact the whole crew seemed to be having a really good time the film ends with tobi arriving home from the summer rowing camp a changed boy stepping off the bus and facing his front door his stern look changes to a faint smile a small touch but a reason robert stadtlober has won awards and why the film will win aclaim
the songs on this dvd are very clear and the best collection of abba songs around the videos overall are comical since the steps and production appear so scripted none the less the videos are very entertaining if you are a true abba fan
10.97 free shipping 35 great tracks wonderful ! since i have n't been to an abba concert in over 25 years this was a real trip in a time machine what else could a fan want check out the bonus picture gallery too a video scrapbook included for free abba fans this is a must
this exactly what the title says it 's a comprehensive presentation of abba songs with excellent photography i 'm glad i bought it
i am generally not a fan of music though i do have my favorites abba is right at the top of my list yes the sound on this dvd is dated and the video 's look like early prototypes but unless you are in that of the world 's population who can not stand abba you absolutely need this collection and at the price currently 11.00 amazon you need to order it today great fun ! as a bonus these videos especially mama mia '' will make the abba performance in 's even more enjoyable
this dvd is a must for abba fans the videos are in chronological order so it is great to see them so young in ring ring '' and to watch them mature video by video take a chance on me '' is my fave but they are all awesome showing sides of anna and agnitha you will never see elsewhere ! also the photo slide show alone is worth the price do yourself a favor and take a chance '' on this dvd ! !
this collection of music videos just makes me smile and feel warm the video concepts are low tech agnetha and sing at each other facing 90 degrees away from each other or into mirrors but they are so earnest and the music so upbeat even when they are singing about the break up of their repectives marriages that i could n't resist singing along the dvd is worth the purchase alone just to see the progression of the women 's hairstyles from poodle perm to sleek flat ironed to cranberry colored mullet with a headband
i am writing this review for those not yet familiar with the music of abba i am old enough to remember them in their heyday but was not into the music of the 1970 's at the time i became an abba fan after having the chance to see mamma mia '' twice in new york city i bought the cd that goes with this dvd and i was hooked with their very singable peppy lyrics if you are not familiar with their songs give their music and this dvd a chance and you will find yourself becoming pleasantly addicted
almost all these videos are exceptionally good and i do n't think they look dated i think these abba videos looked good then and look really good now they are watchable and are n't flashing images like what mtv has been playing the past years where the mtv diva '' women look like retired porn actresses and the men like ex convict metal rappers who are never shown for more than a secord or two and thank god for that the abba women still are cool to look at in these videos excellent videos !
there was one other reviewer here who was definately right abba the definative collection '' on cd is really all you need abba is great music i do n't know any female singers who can match their talent and energy when they sing however these videos are nothing impressive lasse hallstrom should only just be mentioned for making these mediocre videos he certainly deserves no outstanding praise you would think that it would be exciting to watch these girls sing these songs but these girls do n't look like they are expressing the energy that you would expect to see with these exciting songs if i were allowed to mildly exaggerate just a little in many cases here it looks like we are just looking at a photograph and they creatively made the lips move they look very stiff and perhaps a little bored and if they are dancing they just seem to be making only a effort to just sway to the music do n't you think that dancing queen '' should have had some talented expressive dancing as a video the energy just is n't here they look like they filmed the video just after waking them up they must have edited out all the yawns the girls are beautiful of course but these videos are just not that interesting and since these songs are only available on this dvd as 2.0 stereo having the cd of these fabulous songs is a great deal more of a bargain because the sound quality is what you would want to improve on if you 're going to listen to abba 's music and it would n't hurt them if they tried to be a little sexier there is no sensual teasing in any of these videos but yes i know most of these videos are made long before the mtv video age but regardless every abba fan should have this video collection however i get more out of abba when i just shut my eyes and listen to their beautiful songs i think their most impressive song is chiquitita '' it is a perfect song ! beautiful guitar and orchestration and the girls hit some fabulous high notes and with pristine synchronized harmony but again the video here is just weak and unimpressive abba the definative collection '' on cd is good but you really should check out the 4 cd box set of thank you for the music '' all their best and more are in this collection and what 's more the fourth disc has some excellent rarities from their entire career span on the fourth disc they have a 22 minute collage piece called abba undeleted '' that is just fabulous to listen to they ran a bunch of unfinished songs together mixed in with some of their session talking in their native tongue and some instrumentation samples and some cute laughter within this collage of many songs there is a song in there called just like that '' i really do wish that they would have completed and released this song as a single i have no doubt that it would have been their biggest hit ever made believe me if you do n't buy all these albums on cd separately than you at least should have their 4 cd collection called thank you for the music ''
guitar players rarely come any better than the criminally underappreciated gary moore if you love hot guitar playing and have never heard this man before this is the dvd you need in your collection right away ! in this dynamic 1990 performance at the montreux jazz festival we see gary moore taking his place alongside eric clapton stevie ray vaughan jimi hendrix and eddie van halen as one of the most powerful guitarists in the world of rock and blues ! it is a shame that a guitarist of this calibre is only marginally known here in america the electrifying solos that dominate this performance show that gary could easily blow most guitar players right off the stage ! this show captures moore in his prime right at the point when he switched his style from heavy metal to most of the songs here are from his excellent 1990 album still got the blues one of the highlights of the show is a hot performance of texas strut '' where gary pays tribute to stevie ray and billy gibbons of zz top with some nice impersonations of gibbons and vaughan another highlight is the special guest appearance by blues legend albert ice man '' collins who delivers a fine version of the beautiful blues masterpiece cold cold feeling '' albert sticks around for several more songs too gary delights the audience with three encores and finally ends the show with the haunting and searing guitar instrumental the messiah will come again '' if you care anything about electrifying guitar solos or powerhouse music buy a copy of this sucker and turn it up !
having been a gary moore fan for about 8 years i was thrilled to see the release of this dvd and since he does n't come stateside very often to play live this was a real treat to see him play his mastery of guitar is unsurpassed by anyone i highly recommend this dvd for anyone who loves great blues and rock riffs galore ! ! !
this guy is the best folks ! if you 're thinking that this is all just slow blues material your very wrong ! gary shreds on every song with conviction this is the best blues performance i 've ever heard
gary came out of the shadows for a lot of listeners with his blues albums the roots of rock can be found in this music and gary wrote a classic blues tune of his own as well still got the blues it was like he had been given a second chance he certainly grabbed it with both hands as he does on this recorded evidence he has a good band here and plays very well the direction is solid and shows all the players to good effect if you are a fan of blues or rock guitar played with a lot of passion then this disc is an essential purchase
this dvd shows how great gary moore really this guy just blows ! ! makes me want to throw my guitars away and make coffee tables out of them ! ! vintage gary moore !
this dvd shows gary moore at the apex of his career which has since gone down the is still great to hear the live version of 'still got the blues ' the instrumental 'the messiah will come ' is should go down as the best rock instrumental of all time too bad moore has not been able to replicate his success although his cd 'stormy monday blues ' is worth listening abu bakar malaysia
excellent music and video if you like the blues you 'll love this collection
i 'm a guitar player of sorts and have been a blues fan for years have just recently discovered gary moore ! this dvd is a must have for blues fans and guitarists alike how good is it let me just say that when i first watched this i thought i had died and gone to guitar heaven ! there are many different opinions as to what a great '' guitarist is i do n't know about anyone else or who gets to say who the best '' is if there can be such a thing today but gary moore just has to be in the top ten ! why it 's his tone ! the sounds he pulls from that les paul ! his blues phrasing is excellent and refreshing incredible note bending and sustain his version of the stumble is a masterful demonstration of blues phrasing and a great tribute to peter green and of course freddy king ! yes there are the various king influences way of interlacing his phrases with the most searing blues guitar sound that i 've ever heard is nothing short of amazing still got the blues for you is perhaps one of the best blues songs ever written ! this whole dvd is at it 's best if gary had not gone into blues he would have always been a great rock guitarist what sets him apart and above the rest of the great rock guitar players is his ability to grind out the blues not everyone can play blues like this you have to feel it not play it ! and boy does gary show you how he feels ! he draws every ounce of emotion from every single note he plays especially on the return of the messiah '' i think gary moore has done something very few top rock guitarists can do a new sounding blues form with a hard rock edge to to do with so many blues '' artists around ! get this dvd ! it will rock your socks off ! it 's great and so very cheap it 's actually a steal at this pice and the delivery service was fast hassle free ordered it on my door the next week on friday
republocrat zombies on the march heil bush they chant with glassy eyes stomp out freedom subvert the constitution for their corporate masters force their fascist down everybody 's throats stare at the tv it 'll all be ok they say turn off your mind become infantile like us soulless automatons mindless flag wavers slaves of the dark lord bus
michael moore 's stunning documentary on the attempt of conservative thinking to distort the liberal point of view is riveting moore tells it like it is to the distain of many misinformed conservatives who lead perfunctory lives at best it is well researched and not slanted as many detractors would have the viewer believe it is very unbiased and objective in its presentation
when i first heard they were going to turn the da vinci code into a motion picture i was disappointed it would made a much better and i still believe that however hats off to ron howard director and akiva goldsman writer for making a film that captures the true essence of the novel what they chose to leave out works and the main storyline remains untouched from the novel i also was n't thrilled when i heard tom hanks had been cast in the lead role of robert langdon and while his performance was good i still think he was too old for the role a man in his middle to late thirties would have been a better choice than the aging pudgy hanks regardless of this small gripe the da vinci code as a movie was very good even though i 've read the novel upon which it is based twice i still found myself on the edge of my seat as i watched the film if you liked the novel you will like the movie
holy mother of mary ! how do you describe a movie that asks you to seek the truth '' where the truth '' puts one of the foundations of christianity into question well in a nutshell i 'd describe the da vinci code as a classy whodunit with a religious twist tom hanks again proves to be one of the best actors in hollywood by bringing dan brown 's character robert langdon to life rare is it that a film adaptation of a novel is as good as the book and the da vinci code that axiom but the da vinci code delivers it 's entertaining thought provoking controversial suspenseful thrilling has all the main ingredients of the book 2 and a half hours is a bit long but kudos to ron howard and the producers for not editing out key details just for the sake of time in fact even at 150 minutes the film adaptation comes up a bit short on explaining the significance of a few of the details that would put the story into a more clear perspective but overall it 's an enjoyable movie for open minded movie goers is it fact or fiction that 's for everyone to decide for themselves it is indeed a philosophical idiom fielded to the public under the guise of a
i read the book before i saw the movie i am a committed and devout catholic christian also but i never read the book or saw the movie as anything more than exciting fiction i think all the bashing and alarmism from the religious right was overblown by the media and many in the christian community who gladly mined the book and movie themselves for profits witness all the '' books movies and audio tapes if you are secure in your faith the book and film should not affect you it did n't for me it actually led me to read more of the bible and the patristic fathers of the church as for the film well the book was probably one of the best '' i 've ever read i expected to be disappointed by the movie but was not '' i thought tom hanks and the cast were great do n't miss it ! unless of course you feel it is offensive as thinking adults we can and should all decide that for ourselves atreides
my review can be summarized as a well recommended movie that is worth at least a rental but the movie may be worth buying since its release is a blockbuster for the holidays and has been deeply discounted overall i enjoyed this movie and i would have given it a 3 and a half if possible the reason why it is not a four but still a strong three is that the movie was enjoyable and was able to keep a certain amount of suspense throughout but is not something i would watch over again the movie moves quickly enough and with out giving anything away does n't play the hollywood '' card very much the acting and visual elements were done well the bonus dvd has some interesting behind the scenes value especially because the film was done in some very historically significant locations
both the dvd and the movie are quite good and interesting and i watched it with interest there was a lot of controversy chasing and mysticism so if you are into such things you will probably like the movie as well
the logo network presents noah 's arc which is a show about four human beings dealing with human issues each character reminds you a little of yourself someone you many know it 's about four friends noah alex ricky and chance noah is a screenwriter who has fallen in love with wade who is also a screenwriter but happens to be straight so he claims alex works at an hiv clinic and is in a seven year relationship with his partner trey who works in a hospital ricky is the owner of a melrose avenue clothing store who is also the promiscuous one of the group chance is a college professor who has moved in with his partner eddie and his daughter kenya all four characters have an equal part to this wonderful story about love comedy and drama patrik ian polk is the brain child behind this show which is a spin off from his cult classic punks '' this is in my opinion the best show on television the dvd is absolutely worthwhile it has commentary from the cast and creator audition footage the original pilot episode and tons more features the show is not for everyone and it does n't claim to be but if your into a show that has all the elements that an entertaining show is suppose to have love comedy and tons of drama i 'll guarantee you 'll be hooked on noah 's arc ''
i am a customer that just searches through the tv shows to find new and interesting show well i saw this show and decided to order since i never heard of it before i think its a really smart and funny show i fell in love with it and was hooked after the first episode if you like trying out new things noah 's arc is for you
i love noah 's arc ! the guys are hilarious and so sexy ! every single episode is well written i wish the season was longer
i can not tell you how much i have enjoyed this series i expected it to be kinda lame but it is actually like the drama that goes on daily in most of our also loved that it had a mix of characters and it was n't all based on their sexual escapades but issues that gay men go through daily i hope this seires continues and gets better i am anxiously awaiting season 2
i 'll make this short i could not have made a better purchase i waited over 8 months for the series to come on dvd and it was worth ever second of waiting i cant seem to take the discs out of my dvd player waiting now for season 2
i really enjoy the series specifically because it is based on the lives of four homosexual black males which is something unheard of on americas 's '' television network a gay soap series ! even though african americans have portrayed homosexual roles on television before this series almost makes that fact taboo in the sense that it illustrates the quote on quote everday life of multiple homosexual african american men i think the plots are very dynamic and the cast is as well being that the series compares to much of reality there can be predictions based on a viewers personal experiences and in the same breath there can be suspense i am very proud to see all of the support not only from the cast but more so from the viewers considering the ratings and popularity of the series i would have to say that america may be changing just a little less than 30 years ago an interracial couple on television was considered taboo now we have noah 's ark
i am a fan of noah 's arc it is an african american queer as folk its ground breaking and a delight i like the synergy of the actors however my only problem with it is the limited amount of time devoted to an episode if patrik ian polk wants this to really progress he needs to take it to 1 hour and add more depth to the characters its good but it can be better you will definitely have a good laugh SMILE
excellent on dvd as it was on actually better because you get to see more the commentaries are nice because you get to know how the scene was set up and what the actor was thinking if you have n't brought this dvd then what are you waiting on i got a good deal here on amazon the price was right and well worth it ca n't wait for the season to be out on dvd
it would be nice if black gay characters were neatly mixed in with the likes of a queer as folk and shows of the like since they are n't noah 's arc serves as a nice alternative i was prepared to hate it but it 's nice to see actors who despite varying levels of acting ability make a truly valiant and earnest effort to bring a voice and three dimension to the lives of gay black men i rented it and watched the whole thing and fell in love with it 's premise of friendship and personality dynamic i subsequently bought the series and am looking forward to the next season to be released since logo is unavailable where i live my hope is that noah 's arc will continue to be a hit and reach audiences outside of the expected '' demographic

my kids 8 11 just can not get enough of this movie the story line appeals to them as does the music and the characters my younger daughter watched it 3 times in one weekend
i got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college good grief since when is a musical ever realistic especially one that is geared to kids hello ! ! it 's not supposed to be realistic ! if you expect realism go elsewhere but if you want to have some fun with a great message woven in then watch this movie kids love it mine do along with anyone else i 've talked to and the message is just terrific it 's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes dislikes hobbies no matter what anyone else thinks i love it ! i ca n't even begin to say how much better this is than grease '' the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be happy '' relax with your kids go get some popcorn and have some fun with the wildcats kids from highschool musical
this is a great family movie my son and my niece really enjoy watching the movie i really recommend this movie to familyies with children
my children ages 6 and 11 absolutely love high school musical my son 's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring and he 's very excited about trying out for a part i enjoyed watching it as well the musical is set in a fairy tale high school but what musical is n't a fairy tale puppy love and teen rivalry all done in a disney way walt would have been proud

seemingly a french on the classic english mystery play format this delightful farce is actually a perfect proof of how great and sexy women of all ages are especially french women starring catherine deneuve virginie ledoyen ludivine sagnier isabelle huppert danielle darrieux fanny ardant firmine richard emmanuelle
a previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values however even though there are elements of the risque in the film the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all i thought that the plot the scenery the songs and everything else was all great it is a french musical whodunnit but one that does n't take itsself too seriously whoever wrote the bad review should n't take it so seriously either besides it 's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate my favorite characters were played by denouve and huppert both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required then again it is a musical so disbelief should be left at the door
having stumbled onto this film being played on tv late last night and given that emmanuelle bart was in this i was immediately hooked into watching it as has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinma francais deneuve bart fanny ardant isabelle huppert the list goes on and being that the story revolves around these 8 women yes i know but there was really no other way of putting it it keeps you locked in what i found fascinating were the songs now normally i hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random think rocky horror picture show but this i can tolerate the songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it 's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs it 's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes which is pure brilliance even if you do n't like french pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which when it breaks into a song is exactly what it becomes ! the basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead so whodunnit this leads to questions over betrayal family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses there seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie no ifs no ands no buts ! oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film i will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry it 's that good ! just simply superb there 's nothing else to add
this farcical who done it '' is funny absurd campish and silly all at the same time starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the french cinema 8 femmes reminds me of similar who done its '' such as agatha christie 's ten little indians and especially neil simon 's murder by death adapted from the play by robert thomas which accounts for the stage play feel to the production this one begins as a proper murder mystery might with a murder in a house out in the country somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion while neil simon made fun of detectives in murder by death and agatha christie made fun of murder period here the fun is on the players themselves what follows as all point fingers away from themselves is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about the scandalous revelations including interracial lesbianism and heterosexual incest are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties note suzon 's pony skirt to quote a line from the film it 's a sad family affair '' played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight yet there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film strange in another sense this is a celebration of some of the french cinema 's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs catherine deneuve heads the cast as gaby the wife of the murdered she looks stately beautiful and more than a bit spoiled danielle darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother mamy isabelle huppert makes herself into a neurotic dotty old maid named augustine while emmanuelle beart plays louise the sexy maid fanny ardant is pierrette gaby 's scandalous the cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet way in a kind of gender joke no men appear in the movie although we do see the back of marcel gaby 's husband a couple of times you will not be able to guess who done it but i will not tell you why see this for danielle darrieux one the grande dames of the french cinema whose film credits go back to 1931 yes 1931. she has a lot of fun in a juicy part
yes this murder mystery is twisted and dark but also wonderful to watch all the characters with the possible exception of the father are so intriguing and bizarre and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat what a nasty family but one ca n't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates they put the fun in the word dysfunctional without a doubt beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery true that it is primarily shot indoors but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot i do n't know but it is certainly a feast for the eyes the story itself is pretty good and not difficult to follow but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss
8 women is a good murder mystery with humor light heartedness and mystery it combines a bunch of the best french actrices and an enjoyable plot a real guesser until the end
i absolutely loved this movie it was so funny and light hearted craig ferguson was very good it is just a good movie to watch if you need a little uplift
this is a delightful film a very funny british comedy craig ferguson who wrote the script and is one very creative guy if you have n't seen it check out the late late show on cbs which he now hosts he is the funniest guy on late night tv in my humble opinion i 've shared the saving grace dvd with a few friends and they have all loved it just sayin'
this is a funny film and one you might as well buy because you are going to watch it again and again for the silliness and comfort for craig ferguson fans it 's a must tcheky karyo fans will chortle as he pops up yet again where least anticipated newly widowed grace pertly played by brenda blethyn finds her dissolute husband has left her nothing but debt creditors and now besiege her lovely cornish seaside home as she seeks solace in tending her greenhouse orchids she ponders how to get out of the financial quagmire for distraction she charitably tends to her feckless caretaker craig ferguson 's ailing cannabis plot and a joint venture blooms as grace and matthew modify the greenhouse cultivate the crop and go to market hilarity as they say ensues the villagers all characters we wish were in our local pub are perfection as they feign ignorance of the entire enterprise while quietly lending unseen support to their beloved neighbor no one is as he or she initially seems and the various ' in the subplots are charming and delightful there is much 70 's style stoner humor but with an updated wonderful and uniquely british twist obligatory locals inadvertently get stoned '' sequences are not only original in their construction but somehow innocent and sweet the ladies and the corn flakes scene is certainly one of the finest pieces of physical comedy ever put on film and as the story progresses it evolves from a tale of potentially puerile marijuana mishaps to instead one of the power of love and redemption as grace and matthew each find their salvation in the unfolding of a future neither of them foresaw the ending is pure bliss and an absolute upper get it you 'll be delighted
this movie has it all especially for baby boomers of the early 1970 's blethyn as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn 's loyal village friends top off the movie 's touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own
this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio
this is a must see movie for lovers of british comedy this movie had me in stitches in short the plot of the movie is about a widow trying to raise money to pay off the debt her husband left her how does she go about the task by growing pot lots of laughs to be had
this is the very best series i 've ever seen it is addictive in the best possible way
i love everything about this movie it has a way of showing how people will help each other even if it means going to extremes i do n't want to give away the movie plot it has it 's laughs and tears and frustrations it was through this movie that i discovered craig ferguson i highly recommend it it has a happy ending too
i loved this movie right from the start craig ferguson and brenda blethyn are wonderful together and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting unknowingly giggly on tea '' are just a hoot i 'd always liked craig ferguson as mr wick on the the drew carey show '' and it 's nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character
what could be better than watching grizzly crimes in the sunny state and not watching the increasingly repetitive law and order not much except watching galactica seasons 1 and 2. some would say that l o has no lost touch and that may be true however there is a very limited number of changes from one show to the next in terms of plot twists like it was grandma that killed the father or it was the kid that comitted patricide all of the crimes are gritty and realistic instead of fighting over warrants and legal mumbo jumbo csi miami rules ! !
tightly constructed plots and likeable characters make csi miami my favorite of the csi franchises the series did not quite reach its peak until the second season but season one is still entertainment there is an occasional bad episode with plot holes and protagonists acting out of character but csi miami is still easily one of the best crime dramas out there even people who do not like csi often like csi miami those who get annoyed by the wisecracking cops bizarre storylines and of csi might find csi miami to their liking the spinoff is more about developing the main characters and telling a story where every plot element is resolved if you can forgive a weak episode here and there one too many buildings that blow up the second after horatio runs out of them and the fact that the writers had obviously not yet worked out all the details in season one then check out this dvd set i received it from my for christmas and watched the whole series in a couple of weeks extras include several documentaries on the making of the show that will interest fans like myself
although the miami series is not as good as the las vegas series it is still fun to watch with interesting story lines however i think it is kind of weird the way the coronor talks to dead people also david caruso picks up on to many things that the alledged md seems to miss all the time still enjoyable viewing
i was quite the skeptic about this series from the moment i saw cross jurisdictions '' as an avid csi fan i was outraged that anthony zuiker and jerry bruckheimer were looking to turn their winning formula into a franchise and spin it off in law order fashion i believed that sure it worked for law order because each series was different than the original each dealt with different areas of investigation and prosecution but to use the same investigating formula over and over just changing the cities around did not appeal to me whatsoever that was four years ago now as csi miami moves into its fourth season i have become a fan where i once was annoyed by horatio caine his penchant for removing and replacing his sunglasses as well as his constant stance i began to like his character the gentle way in which he treated the victims his passion for solving cases and putting the bad guys away not to mention his obvious chemistry with mdpd 's resident bullet girl '' the lovely southern belle calleigh duquesne the chemistry was what spurred me to purchase season one and i am so far very pleased with the purchase other fans should consider buying season one as all the great '' episodes are contained therein kill zone '' camp fear '' etc i still do n't like the way alexx woods speaks to the cadavers in her autopsy theater as a future pathologist it just makes me roll my eyes otherwise this was a worthwhile purchase i guess you could say that the skeptic has become the believer
i love csi i did n't think there was an episode i missed over here in the uk but having started to watch the first series last night i realised there is alot i had missed i am really really pleased with my purchase i would like to send a big thank you to amazon ! ! ! the only thing i could say is that i did n't know about the customs charge i wish there was an option on amazon to click on that would tell you the customs charge for the items you are going to buy it does warn you about custom charges and to check but i did n't as i thought dvd 's would be fine i will just have to use from now on to avoid but i am still thrilled ! !

i watched this movie on a whim and found it to be one of the best i 've seen the story is great i love the characters i loved the ending i was glad that the people in it looked real '' unlike hollywood movies other reviews go into detail on the plot details i will say no more than i love this movie people i have loaned it to have loved it also with very few exceptions just expect the dialog to be in italian though this makes no difference in the quality of the acting or the story
i admit it i love a sappy movie the more kleenex 's the better i was not disappointed with this one this is the kind of movie that just calls for buying a few bottles of good wine some great cheese and fruit and some crusty italian bread and inviting over some good friends i admit i was a bit put off when i realized it was subtitled in english but spoken in italian but it did n't take long to get used to the subtitles and the italian language playing in the background of my reading only added to the feeling of the movie not detracted from it if you are at that age when it feels like life is one big rut and you long to do something wild and adventurous then you can live out your fantasy in this movie the other reviews will fill you in on what the movie is about all i can tell you is i watched this one and immediately ordered it to add to my collection right between falling in love with meryl streep bridges of madison county pay it forward and shirley valentine get it unless you are a husband who ca n't figure out why women act so loco around fifty you 'll love it
i loved this sweet movie about a housewife who is so taken for granted that her family accidentally leaves her at a rest stop in italy the lady rosalba goes on her own vacation to venice and among a lovely group of people a lonely icelandic waiter beautifully portrayed an eccentric holistic masseuse a sweet muddling an anachist flowershop owner rediscovers her passion for the accordian life and the importance of not being distracted from what is of lasting value
this light romantic comedy could be described as a chick flick for those a bit older and wiser than the target audience for most current hollywood movies in this genre like its predecessor shirley valentine '' it follows a married woman as she escapes a housewife 's life and finds another more to her liking so marginal in her own family that she gets left behind at a tour bus stop and acting on a combination of impulses she takes a vacation on her own in that most romantic of cities venice and meets there among a comical assortment of characters a man who steals her heart the leisurely pace of the story and the gently comic humor are just right difficulties are eventually resolved without great effort sometimes in unpredictable ways and you relax into a world where kindred spirits meet and live happily ever after goes well with a bottle of italian wine shared of course
this is a beautifully unpretentious italian romantic comedy with some strong performances from a cast that includes one of my favorite actors bruno ganz ganz plays maigret in the recent tv series which was such a hit on the continent and which needs to be seen in the usa for me this movie had even more charm than the recent crop of good english romantic comedies such as four weddings and a funeral about a boy and others all of which seem to star hugh grant and an english repertory cast if you found their mixture of reality and comic fantasy attractive you 'll love this movie too although my italian is n't profound i did n't have any trouble with the subtitles it remains to be seen if the american remake can capture this movie 's tone
a quirky story of a woman in an unsatisfying relationship who takes a vacation from her family and finds working class love it 's sweet without being syrupy and full of odd characters who add extra fun
i liked but did n't love the first two mi films the first was artsy but somewhat convoluted and not the second was exciting to the extreme but bloated pretentious the signature john woo doves and lacking any sort of subtlety as we 've seen in other woo films feels completely different than its predecessors thanks to the writing and directing of jj abrahms the creator of alias '' and lost '' you can see his style all over this film the best way to describe is this the first half is like a really really good episode of alias '' but with a 50 million budget the second half is like a really really good episode of 24 '' but with a 50 million budget if you like both of these exciting tv shows i am pretty sure you will like a lot i know tom cruise has lost of lot of folks ' goodwill with the hysterics his totally comments about brooke shields ' post partum depression and other high profile it would be totally understandable if you did n't want to bother with his films anymore but i respectfully ask you to cut him a little slack just for 120 minutes just long enough to enjoy this film it 's worth it trust me !
this first disc on all editions of this movie on dvd includes a featurette that should more than please the casual fan of the film the second disc exclusive to the special edition goes deeper into just about every aspect of the production i just wish they 'd lower the amount of mutual pats in the back '' and tom does all his stunts '' a bit i guess my favorite mission '' would be the first but all of them have great things going on for them as action films go they really belong at the top of the crop the best thing going on for is ethan hunt 's supporting team which for once work together the way they used to in the old series i have a hard time understanding the cold shoulder audiences have given tom cruise over his thing sure it 's hard getting excited about a hollywood star wanting to marry for the third time but as celebrities go nowadays it 's not even worth mentioning it this reminds me the time when james cameron joked about being king of the world '' after winning an oscar and people becoming bitter towards him i guess some people do n't like to see others being too happy with their lives if cruise follows some religion which to some of us sounds more than a bit loony at least he has n't done anything to attack mine like all those involved in the da vinci code at any rate do n't let the mediocre box office results of discourage you from watching it you can see a real effort to make an outstanding film in every scene
the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as dvd is worth looking
considering all the bad press tom cruise and this film got earlier this year i was n't expecting this film to be all that great i mean by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left granted this film is not the most original of plots but i was pleasantly surprised by how good it was what a great job abrams did and what a great cast the film had it was much better than i expected it would be as you watch the film you can definitely see j j 's alias '' touches all over the place there were even a few times when i wondered if sydney bristow was going to jump which would have been so cool tom cruise too a lot of crap for this film whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics i do n't know but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish if you 're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted m is your film
tom cruise 's third and his last mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels it works since abrahams directed this like man version of alias it works as part of the mission impossible film trilogy it works as a taut action adventure thriller it works as a vehicle for tom cruise it is not your father 's mission impossible it starts at a point towards the end and works back the amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece the puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwheming there are a few missteps in the action and the ploting however cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings i will say phillip seymore hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against cruise 's hot and cold action man ving rhames is so under used in michelle monaghan is a star who shined as cruise 's love interest it is a good action flick for those who crave action bennet pomerantz audioworld
this is as most critics agreed the best of the trilogy abrams ' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish including a few twists along the way i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film the only thing i did n't like the short pause in the middle of the film probably for a change between the dual layers very annoying !
it had one of the stupidest music scores that i havd heard in a while sounded like something reserved for a but thankfully this only lasted during the second action scene the assualt on the wharehouse the rest of the movie was awesome a movie with a music score that seemed quite adolescent anyway 4 shining stars
i first found out hannah montana when i realised i saw billy ray cyrus thinking it was someone else at first thank goodness i was wrong ! ! ! i am quite older than being 13 almost 30 but i loved billy ray cyrus when he first came out in early 1990 's and still do now that his daughter miley has her own show and an awesome voice i not only do i get to see and hear him again but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has i knew i had to buy the dvd not question there it 's a piece of my past when i was a teen but it 's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work it tells me to be a kid at heart and laugh every now and then ! !
i absolutely love this show i 'm probably a little older than their target audience i 'm 23 but i ca n't get enough of this show miley is cute has the cutest facial expressions and there 's something about her that just makes her so fun to warch she is n't the best actress or the best singer in the world 's young and can only get better though and still i just ca n't wait for the next new episode the show is funny in a way that sort of reminds of i love lucy the way she always gets herself into situations and tries to get out of them in the funniest way like why did n't she tell the boy in i ca n't make you love hannah if you do n't '' that she could n't go to the hannah montana concert with him instead of trying to do the flinstones and be in two places at once not to mention rapping for him doh di doh di doh SMILE the songs are good upbeat and i think they all have a good message parents might like that they might also like the fact that family is an important aspect of hannah montana her father is also her manager and is like a best friend to miley and her relationship with her brother is like any other loving relationship between a brother and sister they fight alot but are there for each other when it matters i also love the fact that miley does get the best of both worlds
ca n't actually review this yet since it is on but i can say that we enjoy the show i am the mom and i find the show is entertaining one of the best on disney channel nothing objectionable ever and the actors are well cast and work wonderfully together we just saw miley cyrus as hannah montana in concert with everlife and the cheetah girls it was the last show for hannah montana to be on this tour and miley 's show was excellent she is amazingly professional at such a young age and has a lot of charisma and talent we will be purchasing this dvd and we already have the soundtrack with bonus video dvd on yes at 91 minutes it is possible to have up to 4 episodes and still have room for a short interview and bonus footage i know because i studied tv production though i chose to work in another field after college the hannah montana episodes are shown during a hour time slot however when you deduct the opening and closing scenes and all of the commercials you are left with about 18 minutes of actual show even if there are 3 episodes plus the bonus episode that is only 72 minutes leaving almost 20 minutes for the interview and bonus footage
i love this show i have seen every episode so many times now when i watch it i say all the lines with them the bonus episode will most likely be money for nothing guilt for free which i have already seen 6 times i downloaded it i ca n't wait for this to come out i already have the game and have been to 2 of her concerts so i am going to be first in line with both the cd and dvd for thoes who do n't already know there will be 3 episodes the bonus one this is my favorite show and if you have n't seen it yet you should watch it or if you think it wo n't be good at least give it a chance
being a big fan of horror and scray movies i consider this movie to be a success as it succeeded in doing what it intended it scared the crap out of me i would say it is one of the scariest movies i have ever seen those japanese sure know how to scare people the storyline is actually quite good too and while the acting is n't quite inspirational it is quite good by all involved the movie making is of a high quality and all up this is a very good movie well worth buying and watching over again
since ringu '' japanese horror movies are all the rage here in the us but mind you not all of them are actually any good and what works for japanese audiences does not necessarily translate well to american moviegoers for that reason hollywood studios occasionally remake japanese horror hits to give them a western feel as was the case with the ring '' the same happened with the grudge '' a movie whose original played very well in japan unlike the ring '' which hwas completely westernized with the grudge '' columbia pictures took a more restrained route hiring the same director who created the original film leaving its location in tokyo with a cast consisting mostly of japanese actors the filmmakers added only a few hollywood actors to create an american feel i was curious to find out if they succeeded as well as the ring '' did i found the grudge '' to be an thoroughly enjoyable and tense film hat kept me on the edge throughout the sinister undertones of the film the sound effects the strong visuals and of course the stingers all make for a first rate horror film much better than most of hollywood 's fare of recent years though you have to be open to the somewhat different eastern sensibilities the film plays upon
the grudge is the american remake of the japanese horror film what 's different about the grudge is it 's story line at first you think it 's three separate stories then just two and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed storylines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film filling you in on the curse and what 's happening think momento and identity the scariest part of the story and it is pretty creepy is that because of the curse born with the first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters the house not immediately not in the same way no matter what you do you ca n't outwit it if you were in the house it 's got your number the scariest thing is most of the people involved were innocent they had nothing to do with the original killing when seeing the ghost while shocked they tried to help yet still they died there might have been a way to avoid the curse but unfortunately it did n't get carried out there 's no everything is low key and creepy i 'd almost say this is more psychological horror than monster coming to get you horror but never they less you 'll probably end up sleeping with the lights on and wondering if you should evere go into a house you do n't know anything about again
according to the grudge there 's a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage then a curse is left behind it 's a stain '' that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred and it will kill everything it touches all i can say is if that were true then the public better hope i never die in a theater the audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd i 've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with talk about being in a powerful grip of rage more on that later jump scenes rule the day here that 's right this baby is stocked with jump scenes ! if you 're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology then let me explain that a jump scene '' is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience but they 're really well done in this movie and they 're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease unfortunately when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards if you 're gon na scream then scream but then shut up and watch the movie ! this ai n't a comedy and it certainly is n't a coffeehouse so quit killin ' my atmosphere some of you might be a little agitated to know that the grudge does follow some horror movie conventions such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way and of course one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that should n't be there in the first place but it 's forgivable keep in mind characters are n't necessarily supposed to know they 're in a horror movie i 'm sure we 've all explored strange noises before except rather than a horrific disfigured ghost producing the noise in real life the sound is usually coming from uncle larry 's bathroom excursion never underestimate the horror of a night out at the taco bell comparisons to the ring are inevitable so i 'll just say that i personally feel the grudge is the creepier of the two this is a movie that 's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery the japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time i caught some pervert staring at me in the men 's bathroom stall back in my college days lucky for him he took off before i had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage but the ring has the better story and a much better ending the grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing you never really know where it 's going and since the story is n't linear you really have to pay attention i know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish about 9 seconds you just learned something today thank me later so this may be problematic i think it works fairly well but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly as a result i wish the movie had been longer a longer running time could 've produced more character development a more clever way to explain what was going on and maybe even a better ending and there 's my biggest complaint why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the i know what you did last look there 's gon na be a sequel '' ending come on how about some closure it 's similar to if you 're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion but instead for some reason i just decide to end the review in mid sent the gist if you 're looking for some halloween entertainment then the grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery but i strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there wo n't be a big crowd because i know i would 've enjoyed the movie a lot more had i not been surrounded by a lot of comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times folks this is a horror movie tension and atmosphere are a big part of it i look forward to watching the dvd in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots i 'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family rating 4 out of 5
wow that 's the only thing i can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews i admit the very first time i watched the grudge with my father neither of us thought the movie was scary at all and could n't understand its success but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night i really began to see how frightening the movie is probably contains the same amount of fear as the original exorcist another movie that 's really effectively well done you have to watch the exorcist and the grudge at night to get the proper effect the grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story i say pretty interesting '' because the storyline is n't the best or the easiest to understand just interesting enough to get the job done the grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little in fact this is probably its strongest point every time something scary happens you see just a little bit '' of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect which is important if you want to effectively scare someone if the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it would n't have scared me nearly as much because i would have gotten used to seeing it the boy appears and then he 's gone not giving away too much really works with this movie you see to really scare me you simply ca n't put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you have to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable the grudge works well it this area the fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the grudge allows me to give the film another compliment i 'm telling you the scene with the woman inside that building by herself well except for a security guard and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total excitement i this scene i was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her the scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was and the scene a few moments after this happened where she did see something in the shadow was another awesome display of brilliance there 's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie freakin ' awesome ! excellent pacing and suspense makes the grudge a true horror classic in my opinion i 've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and i 'd easily put the grudge right up there as one of the best people today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the exorcist was the scariest movie of i wish everyone agreed that the grudge is a total classic and that the ring is another excellent one
well this movie was typical over the passed few years the fast and the furious films have seemed to do a decent job giving an insider look to the current up to date car enthusiast scene however sometimes it is very unrealistic i 'm assuming for the sake of action people seem to forget that it 's just a movie the action scenes are indeed far fetched but they make the movie watchable i do n't know a ton about cars so i ca n't really say if the movie was accuaretly displayed there or not the plot was dry like the other 2 of the series but how exciting of a plot can you have with the amount of action and skilled driving packed into the movie acting wise i was slightly over impressed i could have done with another main character though he did put me in the mind of a young paul walker i could have done without zachary ty bryan in the beginning maybe that 's just because the only other place i 've seen him is home improvement besides it being unrealstic yet action packed i have came to the conclusion that if you are into cars it 's worth a watch i would n't recommend buying it but renting it would be worth it 4 stars
it really does n't matter too much that almost every scene in this film is so far beyond believable for this is not a movie that 's designed to make sense it 's designed to keep the audience in its seats and in that sense this movie soars like the two films that proceeded it fast and the furious tokyo drift ' is a high octane rollercoaster ride littered with fast cars and fast women and for its target audience teenage boys it hits every mark just right now i am a huge fan of the first film and a minor fan of the second i had absolutely no expectations for this film i thought that the previews looked lame and no one from either of the previous films was making an appearance well vin is in the last 30 seconds but that does n't count so when i watched it i was increasingly impressed with how much i was enjoying myself i 'll point out first off that i was much relieved to see that zachery ty bryan was only in the first few minutes of the film and that his character was not explored throughout the film i ca n't stand him that aside lucus black friday night lights jarhead does a great job here as sean lucus is a much better actor than the overrated paul walker sure he 's got great abs but his acting ability is below and actually made his character interesting sung kang was also very good as han and brian tee was believable in all his irritating as dk bow wow takes the place of ludacris and ja rule before him as the side kick and he does an alright job but he just does n't really fit here luda was by far the best of the three nathalie kelly plays neela the girl sean is fighting for and she is amply hot enough to vie for attention sure the plot of weak and the relationships are unbelievable i mean who can honestly say that they feel a kingpin to the whatever it was mafia is going to agree to have his nephew and some stranger race to squash their beef but like i said it does n't have to make sense it does n't have to be believable fast and the furious ' franchise have done quite well for themselves giving the growing young boys of the world exactly what they want sleek fast cars coupled with hot young tail
the third installment of the movie line based on high performance cars woven into a world of corruption and crime shines compared to the first two perhaps the reason i liked this one so much better that the story has a little more depth a little less cheese and is n't quite so focused on the actual street races that take place the fast and the furious tokyo drift '' takes us into the world of street racing once again but instead of beating us over the head with this overblown c'mon the last thing i have respect for is some kid who is obviously spoiled as he does not work yet has tens of thousands of dollars to dump into a honda car so it can have a bunch of accessories that themselves are overpriced it concentrates more on the japanese culture and how out of place the lead character sean boswell lucas black is when he arrives there the movie also does a good job of keeping it simple by introducing the drift '' technique as opposed to showing adrenaline junkies on some suddenly empty street in trying to see who can beat whom to the finish line sean is a high school aged kid with a history of incidents involving illegal car racing after a final crash he goes to live with his father in tokyo who is stationed there with the navy despite putting strict rules on him it 's quickly becoming obvious that you ca n't stop sean from racing which usually is started over some mouthy competition over a girl sean soon finds himself over his head as he crosses paths with a man who is the king of drift '' brian tee as he also finds out these are not americana dirt roads that have some gravel for leeway and ultimately makes a fool of himself at his initial race while desperately trying to figure out the timing and skill it takes to cause the car to drift essentially getting it into a partial spin by adjusting the brakes viciously and the gas liberally this installment of the fast and furious '' series is again much more believable than the first two gone is the supreme bravado and empty glamour from bad boys its replaced with a better plot and tight script that is not over the top but still suspenseful at every turn brian soon finds himself in over his head as 's girl is someone he finds that he cares about but by then he 's in deep working with one of 's associates who is ultimately going to get everyone in a ton of trouble i 've never liked low riders let alone the phenomenon that seems to surround the modern day racers for that i was happy to see a good old american muscle car come into play in the movie showing the boys what real cars used to be made of the racing scenes at night along the winding cliff roads are marvelous and have a good cinematic appeal to them as well as some of the more drab parking garage stunts which always give an appealing crash here and there after a multitude of lawsuits after amateurs lets face it if you want to start talking real racers look up foyt or emerson fittipaldi were actually trying to reproduce the rush they got from watching this stuff and killing dozens of innocent people in the process i was surprised they were even able to come out with another installment a guest star that was present on the original will make an appearance at the end of the movie only to my disappointment tokyo drift works because this time they actually worked a little on the storyline and surrounding instead of throwing vin diesel tough guy quotes at us for 2 hours lucas black does a great job with some humor as he plays the part of southern country boy gone to tokyo '' quite well
after buying the original the fast and the furious '' i found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it however i can now say i am a fan of the trilogy all 3 films are good lucas black is simply the man and gives another great performance here bow wow does a surprisingly good job as well car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie which i am neither this is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy
the fast and the furious tokyo drift is about a 17 year old kid named sean played by lucas black sean loves cars and he loves to race them but it 's too bad he ca n't get away from the police like brian o'conner paul walker because he 's already been caught twice and is on his way to a third strike sean ends up wrecking his car in a race against a high school jock who was racing to keep his girlfriend sean gets caught and instead of going to jail he goes to tokyo to live with his father what you have here in tokyo drift is a new beginning for the fast and the furious series vin diesel is no oscar winning actor but he made the fast and the furious good you ca n't lie and say it does n't need him since diesel wo n't come back and even with help paul walker ca n't give the film what it needs why not change everything but still keep the idea of being fast and furious the film seems to be trying to start something new just like the original film being the first of its kind the only material i 've been able to view japanese drifting is in the anime initial d and this film both show different views on the style of the people who drift in japan one similar thing is that everybody 's cocky and sure of their skills and everyone lives and breathes drifting i have to tell the truth because i truly think this film is up there with the first one i 'm not saying it 's better but this nicely done and has an original story just like the first film although the cast may sound weak i had a little faith in lucas black and little faith in bow wow bow wow is actually a talented actor and does a nice job supporting lucas one thing i hated was that the writers just had to add the hot girl that is in the middle of two guys she has to choose between the guy she is supposed to love because his family saved her life and the new guy she 's supposed to hate because he 's an american you think that people would get tired of that stuff by now when will someone surprise me with something different in the first fast and the furious it was brian chasing toretto 's sister in the second brian was chasing monica eva mendes and now you have sean who 's chasing neela i have plenty of positive things to say about this film i really liked this story even though it was getting too close to being another one of those teen movies i love the drifting and the way it was filmed i had doubts about the whole drifting idea i thought drifting would be fun to do but boring to watch and i was wrong because it was hot the slowed down scenes to show just how close these cars come to hitting the wall and spinning out of control is amazing what i loved most about this third film is that there is a perfect blend of action throughout the film there 's not too much talking and not enough action or too much action and not enough of a story the city was beautiful lots of lights cool buildings and plenty of color the characters are all written well and actually have deep stories there 's not as much nos used and not as much speed as the first two movies but this movie is still very exciting i do n't think i can stress enough on how great the drifting is and how beautiful the cars are fast and the furious tokyo drift is entertaining and hopefully there will be more from the series like this one
this is a great dvd set for anyone who are fans of the films these are three great films with memorable charecters fantastic special effects and action sequences as well as some very witty humor they are also a great social commentary on todays society here is what this set contains disc anamorphic widescreen presentation scenes rose interview watch featurette jackman screen test gallery disc united anamorphic widescreen presentation by director and cinematographer by producers and writers disc the last stand anamorphic widescreen presentation by director and writers by producers scenes with optional director commentary endings with optional director commentary buy this dvd set
united and the last stand '' are simply spectacular ! the cast the characters the special effects the story the action scenes and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever ! ! ! have seen lots of movies in my life but nothing compares and comes close to
in there was the attempt by magneto played superbly by ian mckellan to convert humans to mutants in it was a plot by a corrupt fed to kill all the mutants using xavier patrick stewart in a cure '' is found that makes all mutants human cure indeed who said the mutants were sick such is the view of the mutant leader magneto in the final chapter magneto fears that the cure '' will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way all three movies are suspenseful and exciting no bathroom break urges in these films new mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched quite early on in special effects are if you 've not seen any of the movies or all of the movies in the trilogy this is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic tale in the genre that belongs in any fan 's collection hugh jackman is excellent in the roll as wolverine we like you better as a tough guy hugh halle berry storm anna paquin rogue james marsden cyclops and rebecca romijn mystique are all too and famke janssen is phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy beast is in too actually played by to my surprise in the rolling credits kelsey grammer ! now there 's a real mutation ! all in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here x fans wo n't miss these and you should n't either if you 're into the action or fantasy genres
while it 'd be impossible for any films to do justice to marvel 's legendary team of mutants i really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for the casting was strong the action was solid most of the characters were portrayed memorably and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the the first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and hugh jackman was as wolverine the most iconic and arguably the hardest to cast and famke jansen was a fantastic jean grey for at least the first two films patrick stewart professor x ian mckellan magneto and rebecca mystique also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons the story was a nice update of the comics and followed rogue 's induction into professor x 's school for mutants and magneto 's first big terrorist attack on mankind a satisfying start to the series the second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite including nightcrawler whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film pyro and iceman the story involves wolverine 's past and the government 's attempts to control the mutant population the result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch for some ridiculous reason at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last this was a bad choice that made no kind of sense upset the films ' fans and severly hurt the quality of the third film ah the third film a mixed bag to say the least the plot deals with two classic storylines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary dark phoenix my personal list of complaints is a long one but i 'll just hit a few in this review the last stand '' tries to cram two movies ' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with the introduction of the phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the classics in comic history and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic like why an entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist 's side and just look menacing for most of the story the series ' former darling rogue is reduced to a brooding has no real influence on the story plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine on the other hand more classic characters are given parts such as kitty pride and collossus both of which had cameos in angel multiple man beast played nicely by kelsey grammer and the almighty juggernaut whose battle with kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected but as many characters as there were that made it into the three films there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny unnamed cameos in the series or forgotten altogether no gambit emma frost sinister apocalypse scarlet witch or havok to name just a few furthermore the final film 's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead though they do leave us a glimmer of hope there are talks of wolverine and magneto and possibly a new mutants project promising ideas but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love still in the end i really did enjoy as a film as it did have several great moments it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series in the end whether you 're a fan of the comics the cartoons or just a fan of or fun movies in general you really should n't miss out on these three movies the series is full of memorable characters fantastic battles sly humor references for fans and of course the classic social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness there does n't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition but for about 10 a flick i 'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain highly recommended set
's action was bland at best the choreography was horrible and ratner did n't shoot it well at all the entire movie included the pacing editing was horrible characters were killed off and not given justice nor onscreen deaths in one instance a real sin and the story was rediculous the two movies would be the only reason to buy this box set the was a disappointing that was rushed just so fox could make their money had they waited and let bryan singer direct and gotten good writers such as david hayter who wrote the screenplay for the previous 2 movies then had plenty of potential to end on a solid note and conclude what was imo the best superhero movies the worst part of was the fact that they could n't follow simple continuity set up by the two it was honestly rediculous to see onscreen you 're better off just buying the two dvds in their 2 pack is barely worth the disappointing view
all the movies are good on their own i would take a half point of the thrid becuse brian singer did n't finish his trilogy but the last movie served as a great place to showcase wolverine and i see it as a great little action flick so i give it the five stars sit back and enjoy
i saw this movie twice the second time knowing exactly why i wanted to see it again if you are trying to find out if you love someone or not make sure that you see this movie such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives explains why we are where we are and makes you part of the harmony is love as simple as teaching someone to bike think about it if there are no rules against it this film should be renominated for oscar
this is a beautiful film that makes you cry and laugh and at the same time although one could critisize that it uses certain klischees and stereotypes we all know that if you open your heart things like that can and do actually happen in real '' life overall very inspiring i love this film ! bless all who resist it 's magic
this is definetly one of the best movies of all times no effects no show just the opening of souls and minds of normal people the music is is just a perfect frame for a perfect picture
this is the first movie i 've been to where at the end i wanted to stand and applaud i think the sound of the choir at the end had such an overwhelming physical affect i was physically and emotionally moved i felt as if all my cells were hopping after i saw this film i heard a physician on public radio talking about 'sound therapy ' and the ways in which music song and sound can heal the body
this review focuses on various topics of the film rather than details of the storyline i sobbed from a epiphany sparked by this film films like this that dig beneath the surface of human experience are once in a blue moon it demonstrates a sincere belief in the good of it speaks the message again and again that one 's best is all anyone can ever do it serves to humanize all members of a society regardless of their actions referring to battered woman and husband it is a story of a group of individuals learning to listen to one another and the choir is a metaphor for the grander society an indispensable lesson for the of our world it is about release of judgment and fears a beautiful film ! if you enjoyed life is beautiful roberto benini or together another swedish film you may really like as it is in heaven
i saw this movie at a relative 's house in sweden and loved it very funny and fantastic music wonderful to see northern sweden and a choir develop like that nominated for the foreign language film oscar a year ago or so whenever it becomes available in the us getting it worth seeing transfer this film to us format fast
first of all it is important to understand that we never went to the moon the apollo project was a hoax i wo n't try to prove anything to you in this review but i will recommend the documentary film astronauts gone wild in the film the confronts eight of the living astronauts who claim to have traveled to the moon it is clear from their reactions especially buzz aldrin 's that they did not go to the moon buzz aldrin comes very close in my opinion to actually admitting that it was a hoax judge for yourself i am giving this from the earth to the moon a five star rating because it confirms without question in my mind that we never went to the moon so it is a must see for anyone who is looking into the apollo hoax do n't get me wrong this is a very boring so far i 've only watched the first three episodes disc 1 i literally fell asleep during all three episodes so it took me about a week to watch them but this is important because it brings up important questions here are a few questions that come to mind who in hollywood knows that the apollo project was a hoax is tom hanks a criminal for making this film or is he just another person who has been fooled into believing that we really went to the moon is executive producer ron howard a criminal who should be investigated who should be arrested in light of the fact that the apollo project was a hoax it is reasonable to guess that the crew of apollo 1 gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were murdered they were probably murdered because they knew how absurd the idea of making it to the moon within the decade was they were most likely being silenced this is a reasonable theory episode 2 in this deals with apollo 1. after watching this episode i am convinced that those apollo 1 astronauts were murdered and this film is intentionally trying to cover up the murders so the big question if this theory is correct is who in the production of this film needs to be investigated and arrested for trying to cover up the murders of three astronauts
i too have both the original and this 'signature ' editions of this great production so i did the comparison test there is indeed vertical loss of picture in this widescreen '' version it 's been cropped the picture quality still remains quite good however the fact i have both versions should tell you how highly i regard this show even though the episode on apollo 13 is quite lame this series remains a remarkable achievement the very best thing to come out of hollywood in many long years but if there is indeed a true version this is n't it more marketing hype
i watched and loved the series when it originally came out on vhs a chance to meet neil armstrong and john glenn this year prompted me to take another look i consider this work the best of all time which is perhaps biased as i have read extensively about the space program and have been a big fan since attending a parade for john glenn as a young boy both fans of the apollo program and general movie watchers who enjoy human drama and have even a speck of interest in the historical aspects of apollo should be well satisfied tom hanks pulled together an exceptional work as his team hit the highlights and the details at key moments with enough other offbeat and background moments to add to the entertainment one that comes to mind is pete conrad 's instructions to his team to do their business before they headed in for the lunar landing the score fits well and the occasional pop number reminds the viewer how unfortunately long ago these events were given that apollo 11 is only around the midpoint of the series hanks was up to the challenge of maintaining momentum after the early climax focus shifted from the flights themselves to alternative themes apollo 12 highlighted the pete conrad and the luckiest moonwalker of them all al bean apollo 13 obviously could not the movie that was relatively new at the time and remains popular the summary was reasonable with the emphasis on the career conflict among the newsmen just ok and probably the weakest of all the segments apollo 14 had the return of al shepard and 15 's episode was a solid detour into the rise of scientific objectives and the change in astronauts ' thinking once again the astronauts showed their exceptional talents and another part of the gigantic support structure showed its value besides the usual mission control crowd the 9 episode and the apollo 8 episode may be my favorites apollo 11 was of course well done but i am so familiar with the landing and its issues that it was unable to surprise me much however the connection of apollo 8 to 1968 and apollo 9 to the creation of the lem were both clever and solid storytelling that wonderfully mixed the technical and personal kudos also go to the story about the wives in the episode the families largely disappeared after the early segments with the exception of apollo 13 and hanks was smart to round out the series with another round of human interest feel free to watch them over an extended period sampling them occasionally the episodes stand on their own quite well or in groups
some customers have complained that this version has been chopped from the original this is untrue the original was shot in widescreen and then cropped pan scan '' for television broadcast the first release of the dvd set included all of the episodes as broadcast in the television aspect ratio what you get here is a remastered version of all of the episodes restored to thier original widescreen aspect ratio the listing on imdb does not list what the show was originally shot in but only what it was originally produced in this is definitely the definitive version of the series
i will try to keep this short and sweet i watch this series at least once a year to restore my faith in humanity this is the sort of stuff that makes grown men weep it is unbelievably powerful and moving it is without exception my single favorite thing ever committed to film this series is why i bought a dvd player enough said
kudos to tom hanks for bringing a genuinely lavish production historically based and accurate dramatization about the space race and during project apollo how the nasa eventually beat the russians to the moon a fitting tribute to the famous jfk speech with a personal introduction from hanks at the beginning of each episode this dvd series will bring an almost spontaneous swell of american pride to anyone who watches it the historical story lines writing actors ' real people history maker protrayals set decorations stirring theme music and production qualities are all truly terrific a lot of previously heretofore unrevealed behind the scenes manned space program trials and tribulations go beyond merely the highlights into much deeper detail this is movie making at its very best for both contemporary american history buffs as well as space afficionados with a penchant for all the technical aspects of apollo well worth the dvd boxed set price for this superlative albeit tv '' miniseries the newly signature edition '' in high definition widescreen format with dts sound audio transfer promises to be even better than the original come the third week of each july this will be the only thing to watch on anyone 's home theater system as a traditional annual event with episode 6 reserved for the day of that month this is the day in 1969 of the incredible first lunar landing which should be a national holiday to celebrate when men first set foot and saluted the american flag on the moon bravo to tom hanks and hbo for bringing us a fascinating story of for which all americans can take great pride and enjoy for years to come !
first off let me say that the itself will probably never be equaled it is truly spectacular realistic engaging and thorough i have to say though that for the huge price i expected more from the extras the two featurettes were great but why not include the entire live broadcast of kennedy 's 1961 speech i could get the transcript from a variety of sources and not have to pay for it the same is true for the list of famous astronomers i felt ripped off when i saw that everything else was just text and some still pictures i do n't buy dvds to read or look at still art that 's a waste of the medium
i am truly a johnny come lately '' here as i just brought this and saw for the first time just very recently i must say that i was totally impressed by the entire series i have read many hypes about this many have wrote that this is perhaps the best ever made for tv next to the band of brothers for once the hype is true this traced in twelve parts the history of the apollo space progam the men and women who made it worked made it happened along with disasters and mishaps outside of one episode all others relating to the apollo programs appears to have a great deal of historical accuracy i have read the previous review about the widescreen conversion i think there 's a merit to that but i was n't thrown off by it that much to make a difference to me for me it was the story that totally engrossed me another thing i like about this was that it did n't try to compared with movies like the right stuff or apollo 13 but instead work around these two movies thus if you watch right stuff apollo 13 and this you will have a definite visual understanding as drama can have it of united states entire space program until the end of the apollo missions the come highly recommend almost a mandoratory viewing of any americans who still can take pride in what we can do and accomplished if we put our collective effort into it
i guess i am in the minority here i happened to think that in dreams '' was not only a very good film and disturbing but very different from so many other thrillers as for the cast they are all contrary to many other reviews claire cooper annette bening portrays a mother of a young girl and claire also happens to be clairvoyant she begins having dreams of a child that is about to be abducted and killed she implores her husband to contact the police and they dismiss him and her as just another however the dreams she is experiencing are her own daughter she does not realize this until her daughter is abducted and murdered she attempts suicide after learning of her daughters death moreover she is taken to a psychiatric hospital for observation the doctor is portrayed by stephen rea the serial killer is vivian thompson robert downey and his childhood was not a very pleasant one he also is able to reach into claire 's dream and she into his as she begins to experience more and more of her visions and connection with the killer she decides to help the latest victim a young girl who has also been recently abducted by vivian this film is not for everyone and i give a lot of credit to the director and more importantly the writers for coming up with something new even if parts of the film are flawed i would recommend at least renting the dvd to see if you like it before purchasing however i felt it was a very surrealistic and extremely well done thriller and as for annette bening she is terrific as claire stars
in dreams is an extremely surreal movie shot in beautiful colors and unforgettable imagery quite shocking and violent the scenes will stay with you for days after viewing this annette benning gives a top notch preformance she is claire ! ! ! ! and robert downey gives a chilling preformance as vivian the confused reccomended nail biter just wait until the climax at the end on the
what a wonderfully bizarre thriller this is ! annette benning 's performance alone makes it worth watching but there is still so much more the story is so unsettling you never quiet get your grip once the film starts moving from the opening credits where a ghost town becomes submerged as a reservoir to the ending this one is a real keeper the photography and set pieces are absolutely beautiful and do much put the viewer in benning 's head a wild frightening trip
somehow i feel that if this film had been even stranger it may have been more critically popular had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the plotlines it may have been hailed as a david fairy tale nightmare add more violence and it could be a dario argento film but instead we have something by neil jordan who gives this film more wonder and magic albeit dark than anyone else could i think it 's a great film see it 's called in dreams not in logic its surreality is its strength staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by annette bening i think the plot contrivances are almost subversive of course there are moments of coincidence because that 's what happens in dreams moments of opportunity or clarity arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride the film 's general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir and the fairy tale orchard this is a grim tale alright but its beautiful trippy and saturated in atmosphere killer ending too closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director highly recommended for those who like to dream

nothing beats this show archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by bravo for a reason edith was number 12 highly recommend since the that are seen on various tv stations are chopped by about 2 minutes a piece
i am a diehard aitf fan since it first aired so i do n't care about extras or digital remasterings what is being shown on the dvd includes the footage that has n't been aired in thirty years because it was trimmed out so they could show more commercials in syndicated reruns this series was a seminal piece of television history in the current political climate of hypersensitivity and political correctness a series like this could never be produced and it is a sad commentary on how low american culture has declined i do n't know what is holding up the dvd releases but i would snap up the entire series plus abp in a boxed set in a second and i wish that is how they would just release this series
yes everyone loves raymond ca n't hold a candle to all in the family from any of the 9 seasons if you are some young kiddo who has never seen an episode of all in the family please try to catch it this installment in the series took too long to get to the market and doesnt have enough extras why doesnt sally struthers do commentary you figure she would have the time the shows look and sound great the 'subtitle ' option is hilarious with the way they represent archie 's 'bunkerisms ' i will buy all the seasons when they eventually come out this show should be run on prime time network television to remind everyone what quality really means
if you know at all you know that they are one of the most successful rock bands of all time and their concerts are always amazing this dvd is great in that it does n't edit out alot of the flaws and bono 's little speeches in between songs adds to the authenticity of the recordings the big thing that 's pretty annoying about it would be some of the awkward cuts made to blend both days of the concert into one on the dvd the other thing is those stupid shots of bono 's hands that come up way too often other than that it 's worth buying the last encore is the greatest one by one the band members leave the stage while the others are still playing excellent
this was delivered quickly in excellent condition thank
i have been a fan since the mid 80 's if you are a dedicated fan and enjoy watching music concerts on dvd then vertigo 2005 is a must buy the dvd is very entertaining with bono 's storytelling 's performance in chicago and the crowd 's response you will not be disappointed and possibly break a tear during the final encore
from a serious fan 's perspective the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs the bonus material is cool the sound quality 's great the visuals are always impressive but it 's the songs that are the real attraction as it should be two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album boy four in a row from the masterpiece achtung baby and nearly everything from their triumph how to dismantle an atomic bomb i also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums good call ! also many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments such as running to stand still a perfect hybrid of the joshua tree and zoo tv versions elevation longer better bullet the blue sky check out edge 's extended blues jam in the final minutes and original of the species acoustic piano ballad this was the first major tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list for instance when i saw them they played miss sarajevo stuck in a moment gloria i still have n't found what i 'm looking for instant karma until the end of the world and others not represented here here 's hoping they release at least one more vertigo tour dvd
the 2 disk version is really only for die hard fans like me same goes for the recently released zoo tv dvd set however anyone else who even vaguely likes will find the single disc versions excellent it 's typically and basically enjoyable to watch the sound and picture quality is good and you get what is esentially a concert seemingly unedited with bono up to his usual antics and the band playing as well as they usually do althogh i 'm sure that some tracks will have been taken out to fit the dvd into the required space enjoy
reviewer jose graz '' see all my reviews if you enjoy their music and had the chance to go to one of their vertigo tour concerts you 'll love this video i have a few friends that follow just as much as i do but could n't go and every time one of them asked how did the concert go we watched the video there are things that words ca n't explain so it 's great to have this video so that i can transmit the emotion and excitement of being there everyone who has seen it has enjoyed it from start to finish to me is a great video political rant included peace ! !
i disagree with the opinion of those reviewers who found the of the concert captured in this dvd to be lacking as a matter of fact i felt the video was even more interesting as a result of it i got a feel of being in the stage with the band very close to them as i was watching it which is not an experience you can typically have even while attending the concert musically the concert offered an assortment of material both old and new to wet the appetites of most fans plus it accomplished what i 've never felt at a concert before a sense of intimacy with the guys in the band and the audience that is odd for an arena show like the united center where the taping took place overall while not the most innovative show by ever that would have to be the zoo tv tour video i highly enjoyed it and recommend it
the acting writing and complete look of the film are completely fantastic everything is fantastic but jim carrey steals the scenes in a very good way every time he is on the screen he is pure jim the character he plays on the movie is as if it was written just for him he fits is role perfectly the scenery in the movie is very dark and gloomy which sets the perfect tone for the film the costumes suits and dresses all look great and the entire things comes together very nicely overall this is a must see for fans of jim carrey if you love a good movie you will love this like i said this role was made for jc ! !
both of my daughter 's read the entire series of books so far and i decided to treat them to this film when it was released or was it the other way around anyway suffice it to say i was more than pleased with this film the devious count olaf jim carrey was a true joy to watch and the laughter from my daughters was more than worth sitting through the movie i really enjoyed the film and let me tell you children as well as adults will enjoy this film ! on a visual level the film is absolutely stunning sort of a tim burton influence i really liked the part of aunt josephine meryl streep there is a hilarious part with her and count olaf as she is about to be let go on one of the boats i 'll let you viewers watch this part as i do n't wish to spoil it for you and the house aunt josephine resides in at lake lachrymose has a surrealistic and eerie look to it just great ! if you have not seen the film then rent it or buy it i found it to be hilarious and as much fun for adults as well as children i really do hope they make another one as the books continue for quite some time i believe the first three books were the basis for this particular film i would like to see more misadventures of the baudelaire children with their nemesis count olaf i do n't know if there will be but it would be great and how about the end credits best i have ever seen a work of art in itself highly recommend you will not be disappointed especially if you have children
lemony snicket 's a series of unfortunate events the movie is an adaptation of the first 3 books in the lemony snicket 's printed books the movie plot is very much the same as the story of the first three books 1 the bad beginning 2 the reptile room 3 the wide window in the series of unfortunate events is n't a happily ever after kind of story there are three regular children violet who loves to invent klaus who loves to read and sunny who loves to bite violet is the oldest claus the middle child sunny is the youngest the book the bad beginning '' is the basis for the first part of the movie the story begins when the baudelaire children are informed by poe a banking accountant that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire and thus begins a series of search for a suitable guardian and a safe place to live the siblings closest member to their parents is supposedly count olaf only he 's not nice he 's exactly the opposite and he plans to steal the immense fortune left by the baudelaire parents in the bad beginning things well begin badly for the three baudelaire orphans and sadly events only worsen in the reptile room as the siblings move in with their new guardian professor montgomery they find he is a reptile scientist in a room with many different reptiles there 's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly dangerous snake but it 's not really dangerous at all later montes get a new assistant and it is count olaf in disguise of course something terrible happens to uncle morty after that and count olaf again tries to kidnap the children in the wide window poe places the children with a distant relative aunt josephine aunt josephiine lives in a house on the edge of a hill a house that is very literally above lake lachrymose a lake infested with lachrymose leeches who would eat a human if they smelled food on them aunt josephine is as eccentric as other relatives have been she 's a total grammar freak and so scared of every thing that the children have to live in a cold house and eat cold food because their aunt is afraid of accidents with fire when aunt josephine meets captain sham who who is count olaf in disguise good fortune turns bad aunt josephine dies and the apparent cause of death is jumping through the wide window in the living room leaving the three children to captain sham who is count olaf in disguise as the orphans try to figure out a way to escape from count olaf they discover their aunt is still alive and in hiding so they set out to find her and convince her to come back this eventually leads them out onto the dreadful lake lachrymose where count olaf and the dreaded leaches catch up with them while the books leave much to the imagination the visual effects and stunning backdrdops of the movie are well detailed in contrast to the often sparse details in the books
i 'm not very familiar with the books of daniel handler lemony snicket but even by judging this film alone i 'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than harry potter the kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round the story centers on three adorable and gifted children who 're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire their search for a new home and new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious count orlaf jim carrey who hunts after the bauedelaires ' family fortune the main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with new guardians most do n't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea but lemony snicket '' entirely revolves around it equally effective are of course the ghoulish landscapes the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters most of the time it feels like you 're watching a typical tim burton film and that 's a giant compliment since his style is practically unique sinister witty and all at once ! there 's a lot of cgi here but not to the point to annoy you since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects the leeches aunt josephine 's contribute to the morbid atmosphere the cast is terrific as well with jim carrey as count orlaf in one most memorable performance to date i have to admit i initially feared that carrey 's performance would be far but he 's surprisingly mature and convincing the are very well cast as well and so are billy connolly and meryl streep in the most important supportive roles the great cast is completed with respectable names luiz catherine o'hara jennifer coolidge cedric the entertainer in small roles sublime film it 's funny it 's interesting it 's creative ! i recommend taking a chance on this if you like art if you like jim carrey and if you like unique plots highly recommended for all type of audiences !
this movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes a lot of people who apparrently had n't read the book s say jim carey basically played himself in the movie but this could n't be further from the truth he played the part perfectly i 'm not a big jim carey fan but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason the last big criticism of him was for cable guy in which he actually played a serious role i suppose cable guy was a comedy but it was a 'black comedy ' and this movie is much the same sure this movie and the written story is funny but it 's also in that harry potter or peter pan or alice in wonderland or the grinch who stole christmas or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children 's stories ' stream of being a good story for children that 's not the traditional 'happily ever after ' it wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw in our american society put more frankly your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that was n't completely innocent puritanical or childish bottom line because the movie really turned me onto the books i 'm glad i saw it i also think this is a great performance by jim carey from whom we normally expect only silliness
i saw this movie before i read the books the books are much funnier and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film still i liked the film and especially baby sunny i thought jim carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions as always brought the character to life i think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film the essence of the story was captured and is entertaining but i do recommend reading the series before or after watching the film
this is carey at his best this movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome
a delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children 's stories with maybe a bit more bite than the average fare of course it wo n't be for everyone a series of unfortunate events is about the three baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil count olaf a laughable villain determined to capture the orphans ' family fortune this movie takes the first three novels of the series purported to be 13 books in all plus an autobiography '' of the author '' and blends them wonderfully into one tale sticking the and into the middle of the first book it brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting jim carrey brings olaf to life and yes he is overacting '' but he is absolutely true to the character in the books he is perfect in his role billy connolly and meryl streep have great turns as well if you 're a fan of these books you likely wo n't be disappointed if you 've never read them you may like this movie too just know that it 's a little stylized and over the top '' in the end it 's a lot of fun and not that 's not such an unfortunate thing in a film
this is an excellent film with freddie and julia they made a great combo ! i have been searching for the dvd for a while now i finally have it in my hands ! !
i love this movie it is a modern day romantic comedy that anyone will enjoy watching
i love romantic movies and this is the list topper on all extents of cute movies i love julia stiles she 's a great actress every hopeless romantic should see this
plot a mafia lawyer commits suicide but before he does he forces old mark sway who lives with his brother and mother in a trailer park into the car and so he tells mark secrets about where loisianna senator boyd boyette was buried since mark 's little brother has a stress syndrome he ca n't see anything scary randy sway had to go to the hospital ever since his father was divorced he tends to believe that lawyers are morons at times they can get in the way and gets his info about courts and judges on mark meets reggie love a woman lawyer who used to have a drinking problem at first he does n't trust her after many pelts by mafia and annoying reporters already sick of elvis sightings mark has to trust her positives mark is told by reggie that he ca n't lie or he 'll be just like them mafia as such the mafia in this movie are seen as a bunch of criminals even though mark was threatened by a very nasty mafia dude '' he tries to tell the truth he did n't tell about where boyd was buried many scriptures from the bible are written in cells and there is a picture of jesus in the hospital though mark can be a pest at times reggie tries to help him because she cares about him negatives for those people who do n't like cursing there is a moderate amount of cussing in the film of them comes from mark sway 's mouth which disturbed me a bit mark also gives a mafia guy the middle finger secretly mark disobeys his mother by going in the woods and therefore getting mixed up with all this mark got his info about an affair like this on and he claims that he saw a guy having his legs blown off because of the witness protection program on though this is n't shown due to medication mark 's mother fights the at one point though you have to watch to find out funnies in the hospital elvis '' complains about his guitar the way reggie deals with mark at times can be humorous conclusion if you can take the negatives then i highly recommend this movie though i 'd like to say that you should n't buy the client '' to anybody younger than thirteen because even though violence is rarely seen
a mixture of characters seemingly inescapable situations mystery thrilling action and truly scary moments make this film a solid piece of work the seasoned and talented cast add the spice that makes this a tasty thriller for any fan of the cinema emotion spills effortlessly into every corner of the film spreading 'human ' moments everywhere there 's never a dull moment
the is an excellent movie packed full of fine actors and a plot that grabs you immediately and does n't let go the young boy who stars with susan sarandon is an excellent actor and plays such a strong and admirable character of not only a boy his age but of any age a movie i will want to watch again
i enjoyed this movie because it had both suspense and entertainment in it and an excellent cast i highly recommend it
it 's been years since i 'd seen the client but i found the performances of susan sarandon and tommy lee jones as adept and entertaining as ever bradley whitford was playing josh lyman long before west wing and it was fun to see him in this film and funny to think he 's been playing with or near mary louise parker for years ! they seem so young and ageless this is a great film to watch when it 's grey and cold outside because it 's always warm and pretty in memphis in this film
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love '' risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength courage wit and willingness to go up against the big tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools
i saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd i do have to say the movie was renfro plays mark a rebelling boy who knows something that he do n't have to know susan sarandon plays a lawyer who helps mark she did it great tommy lee johnes plays a lawyer who want to ask mark what he saw you must watch
brilliant surandon is captivating tommy lee jones is ruthless in his role the movie has some funny scenes touching and sad scenes and is just an all out powerful movie this is one powerful drama movie with a bit of humor at times it 's really sad what happens at the beginning but the ending is great i love the cast the director adapting the movie from book is great not an easy book to do an adaptation to the young boy who plays mark is very stylish in his role you can figure out what i mean by that if you want i saw this in grade in my american legal systems class and got hooked on it yesterday bought it on dvd and will watch this one over and over again it 's really a classic drama
i teach high school economics and show this video to every class i have seen it myself over 50 times and still love it every time it is great for students to see what corporate giants have to go through to get where they are i point out subtleties in the at the time we had no cell phones answering machines remote controls i also love to point out the stupid corporate guys '' who had no clue or foresight the philosophical differences in the 2 corporations is amazing do n't know how accurate the details are but it makes for a good dramatization not only that the the music is outstanding
xlnt background of the early years i 'm sure that people who are finally getting fed up with the pc world will have a lot of fun with any of the apple 's the movie is a must see
several aspects catapulted me into this movie with a mesmerizing intensity which caused me to watch it several times and to know i 'll continue to do so periodically the strongest draw to this work of art for me was to the performance of the actor anthony michael hall playing bill gates which he did with such exquisite skill that he made me feel he had captured the essence the quiet radiance the charisma maybe even the core of that persona more brilliantly than i 've seen done for any other characterization of a '' on film in fact each of the key actors in this film went beyond the level of outstanding in seeming to capture character in a primal essence the voices and mannerisms of gates jobs and wozniac have stayed with me with such a synaptive strength that i can hear and see them any time my thoughts go there the actors did n't stand alone however they were supported with awesome perfection by the book 's balanced storyline and the art and technique of the which was executed so naturally as to be baseline effective without the viewer noticing the designs and efforts toward effect there was no overwhelm of design only the feel of it there was the being one with the language of film which overtook whatever reality had been playing prior to the first millisecond of the movie 's motion for a bare bones of additional detail about technique feel free to see my review of the dvd of the movie suspect zero each time i my copy of pirates of silicon valley i 'm left with an intense curiosity about how true to reality it seemed and about gates jobs wozniac and the other characters takes '' of this rendition of who they were and what they did a few reviews have helpfully mentioned visiting wozniac or gates web sites and noted that the movie was described as being generally accurate if anyone has any added information on gates or jobs specific comments on this movie please consider beginning a forum in the customer discussion section on this page to be fair maybe i should offer a few backup details for my praise above here 's what i see so clearly even now in bill gates as shown in pirates i see him regularly pushing the bridge of his glasses up to a clearer viewing angle i see the direct gaze of this ancient wise soul working within a child 's anticipatory mind i see his continual expression his intense curiosity and constant calculation it appeared to me that for gates as portrayed by the actor in this film computers are not machines they 're kindred spirits and i do n't mean that as an insult steve jobs was also shown in his unique ways of gazing studying whatever was in his presence his ways of speaking and of flickering continually from a smile to a deadly scowl moods he was a full course study in them at least as dramatized by the actor who portrayed him then of course there was the most obvious of the many film techniques used so beautifully that of posing the head and shoulders of bill gates on a large movie screen in the background with steve jobs standing in a pose live behind a podium below the huge yet ominous presentation on the screen yeah big brother was alive and well ever ready ever in the background of jobs ' motions with no loss of strength or imposition and yet and yet bill gates came across as a hero to me along with everyone involved in this landmark expression of part of the evolution of human brain cell enhancement the way these two cultural giants were played against each other in storyline and through the art of film was an accomplishment of the type of simple genius which in some ways goes beyond even the great gifts of the einstein 's among us there is so much art angst and significance in this film i doubt its makers have seen every angle and facet of it this is something this is something i do n't know exactly if the film intended it but each time i come away from this movie i see all the people in it as nothing less than heroic yet the movie clearly brought out actions and behaviors which i could not condone in any other context in fact which i might condemn however i rarely mark something with a negative triple six as soon as i think about picking up a single stone the smudges on my vest begin growing very purposely that chagrin situation was exposed here this movie captures and holds not only high entertainment with heavy drama and deep comedy it also expresses irony anomaly paradox dichotomy dilemma and more i seek words which mean the containment of opposites within a single framework containment of a long enough duration for the duality to do the thing the ultimate growth sequence of thesis antithesis synthesis '' yet these two opposing elements will not synthesize except separately so the thesis antithesis thesis antithesis seems to be in an eternal loop which somehow enhances life and growth rather than diminishing or draining it if i attempt to analyze this movie much further my eyes will cross and my brain will will what it wo n't melt down it wo n't shut off with does not compute '' what it will do is slip irrevocably into a gordian knot at the base of a universal labyrinth bye bye do n't go there i have more work to do thank you bill steve the makers of the pirates of silicone valley see the credits on this page and the authors paul freiberger and michael swaine of the novel fire in the valley upon which this movie made for cable tnt in 1999 was based i could almost say the film went as far as gates and jobs and their associates friends and families took us as a race as a species as an intriguing culture in a sentient universe maybe it 's not achieving warp drive capacity which first brings a species to the attention of aliens at higher levels of consciousness and accomplishment as star trek has so lusciously dramatized maybe it 's achieving what all the above and the ripples from them have done i ca n't understand why the debut of this movie did n't bring on first contact or has it where are the are they sleeping chust kidding ! what would you expect from an author of a sci fi and a paranormal mystery series who periodically reviews amish mysteries i myself am an anomaly a dichotomy and some though not a sum '' of all of the above linda shelnutt
i enjoyed this movie when it first aired on tnt and only recently got around to buying it as others have said it 's a reasonably accurate portrayal of the beginnings of apple and microsoft though pirates really shows its age today keep in mind that when this was made in 1999 there was no ipod or os x and the imac had n't been available long enough to show any sort of turnaround for apple also at the time microsoft 's plagues of security vulnerabilities and missed product deadlines were rarely published in mainstream media so with all things considered it 's interesting to see this again with today 's perspective as far as the dvd goes it 's pretty sparse on extras a 5 minute clip of noah and a trailer and perhaps more disappointingly is displayed in i ca n't complain too much for a movie but you do n't really get tons of value for what this disc costs
this is a pretty close account of how our technology of today started i too watched this movie when it came out on cable tnt and enjoyed it i would say this movie is about accurate at the time when microsoft and apple came about very good acting from all actors if you are interested in how the two giants started this is the movie to start with this movie is a keeper
this was made for tnt in 1999. it never ceases to surprise me how good most of the cable movies are and this is no exception noah wyle plays steve jobs and anthony michael hall as bill gates i do n't know how much of this movie is true it 's based on a book still it was entertaining and i 'm guessing most of it is fact based jobs and gates are two very different people in personality jobs seems more creative and gates more logical both are power hungry and will get it by any means lots of subterfuge but jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her i could n't understand how he could be so cold toward them especially considering his own background i do n't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film anyway i do recommend this it does n't matter if you know much about computers or not it 's about how they built their empires and them as people
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd
this is an excellent movie one of the best made for tv movies i 've ever seen its close enough to true for me and has the benifet of being very well acted and dramatized noah wyle does a phenomenal job as steve jobs followed by anthony michael hall 's suburb potrail of bill gates all the roles are well acted and the actors bare striking resemblances to the actual players involved if you are interested in the computer industry at all i highly recomend this product as well as triumph of the nerds
this movie is a bit movies root for the underdog after plays up steve jobs wackiness but overall it 's solid i 've watched it many many times and even though it thumbnails the events rather than covers them in detail i enjoy it also recommended triump of the nerds the 3 hour documentary about the same period that was made prior to this
i 've been wanting to watch this for a long time and finally got the dvd this is a story of personalities and egos and visionaries both noah wyle and anthony michael hall do an exceptional job of becoming the computer world 's most iconic figures equally enjoyable are the actors who play steve wozniak paul allen and steve ballmer this could easily have been a worth watching !
if you liked the ultimate warrior at all during the late 80 's you will like this dvd it may be a one sided account of the ultimate warrior 's tenure but it still is one of the better made wwe documentaries super fans of the ultimate warrior will be disappointed with the views but fans of wrestling will find it informative and entertaining
this dvd is so funny i ca n't even put it into words u have to get this dvd it shows how much of an idiot the warrior really was how much talent he did n't have his terrible mic skills etc the expression million dollar body 10 cent brain '' fits him o to well but there are a couple of good matches i mean granted the other great actual '' wrestlers pulled him through the matches
this is a dvd not only for wrasslin ' fans but for all of mankind you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well
this dvd is ultimate warrior was a pretty cool character but legally changing his name to the warrior that is downright weird christain is too funny in his impressionation
i have mixed feelings about the content of this dvd growing up as a young teenager in the early 90 's the warrior was my favourite wrestler the music the frenetic and almost spastic ring entrance the incredible style inside the ring coming some years after his fall from grace and seeing he had a i eagerly logged on to see what he was doing these days the impression i got was that the man was a complete lunatic who had been possessed by his character like linda blair was possessed by the devil in the exorcist his posts on his are like an ever so slightly toned down version of his gibberings on promo slots during his wrestling days one gets the impression that the man got bored of real life so made himself believe he was his character and wrapped himself up in a fairy story where he was the central and only starring figure he could certainly have had a better claim to the narcissist '' gimmick lex luger ran during the early part of 1993. this is the impression we get from his contemporaries who are interviewed on the dvd too jim ross ted dibiase bobby heenan vince mcmahon jerry lawler all line up to castigate the warrior and tell stories of how stiff his performances were how little technical skill he had what a egomaniac he was and how selfish and ignorant he could be i would have been horrified and outraged at this character assassination and instantly suspected another mcmahon speciality screw job a ' la bret hart if it was n't for the fact that this was the exact same impression i 'd gotten from the man 's own disjointed ramblings on his i do n't doubt for a second that most if not all of these highly entertaining anecdotes are true having said that i am left with no doubt that vince mcmahon is also an unprincipled liar and an opportunistic artist the way he talks about the faults of others breaks the known bounds of hypocrisy considering he is capable of being the most dishonest conniving and unprofessional man in the industry him criticising the warrior 's ethos is like a skunk complaining that a dog stinks mcmahon has a brilliant brain for wrestling and its various angles but as a human being he is worth nothing does n't detract from the fact that he 's probably telling the truth about the warrior here however having said this the warrior is still my favourite wrestler of all time and this dvd not only gives you the career commentary but five of his most memorable matches as an extra his wwf debut against a jobber '' his under 60 second ic title win against the honky tonk man at summerslam 88 his wwf title win against hulk hogan at wrestlemania 6 the wwf title defence against rick rude at summerslam 90 and the thunderous career ending match against randy savage at wrestlemania 7 the last one being my all time favourite warrior match and not containing the cuts and rewinds the wm 7 vhs video had the wrestling content of this dvd is great especially for us nostalgia lovers and especially for actual fans of the warrior say what you like about the man and i obviously have done but the wrestler was great fun and captivating to watch the interview content is also captivating and fun the newer and younger guys christian and chris jericho to name two off the top of my head are all enthusiastic about the warrior and recall his days with great enthusiasm they never had to work with him mind you seeing christian 's impression of a classic warrior promo is if you 're a fan of wrestling back in the early 90 's then go ahead and get this you wo n't regret it if you were a fan of the warrior himself then this dvd is probably worth sacrificing one of your internal organs for

pi is a film that will most likely stay with you long after you watch it darren aronofsky requium for a dream created an entertaining experimental film with pi a very dark movie aside from being black and white with a great techno score and extremley bizzare scenes and images pi is a great movie but i dont think it 's so deep and powerful as some reviews stated there was a few things that went wrong with pi that i wont go into but as with most filmmakers making no budget films all their mistakes suddenly become artistic expression anyway if you enjoyed eraserhead or similar films like it then you cant go wrong with pi
do n't read this if you have n't seen the movie ! it took me more than a dozen views to start figuring out how everything was connected what 's with the bugs what 's that stickey stuff in his mainfraim how are his breakdowns and paranoia connected to his work and what is the quite white place he ends up in all the weird stuff is chaos slipping in between the seams chaos which he thinks he 's fighting against at first max had a thread of a connection to the great infinite divine that which human beings are not wired to see he does see it though glimpses at first then the whole thing it almost kills him it 's the classic iccarus story except that max survives and finds happiness at the end i disagree that the end is a 'cop out ' or incongruous it is the cumulation of every frame of the film it is the point ! he looks at the leaves blowing in the trees see a pattern ca n't see a pattern does n't want to see a pattern and for the very first time he smiles why is n't it perfect i would have like to see more actual math the concepts are there but the details are n't not a big deal a beautiful mind '' put a lot of effort into putting real math into the plot and i like that also some of the details did n't connect for example the 'name of god ' long and the number his computer spits out before dying would n't necessarily be connected the system they explained indicated that different numbers of integers would represent a single letter in hebrew like 42 would be a letter and 2 would be different letter so the number of digits would n't really equal the number of letters darren kind of painted himself into a corner there he wisely chose not to make the punch line of the movie a complex number theory proof and i did n't even notice much less become annoyed about this detail until viewing 15. up until then every time i saw it something different would finally make sense thus five stars i 'm inclined to give five stars to any movie that makes me think longer than the credits roll so this one should get many many more
this movie was really on track to be an earth shattering experience for us geeks here 's why out techno music not creepy and etherel in itself but creeped out in the sense that everything is angled and black and white in contrast to the driving beat it 's incessant and a great effect max 's add to the overall creepiness concept brilliant really every pattern can be graphed what if you could graph the pattern of nature and discover a secret formula '' to life max is in it to win it for the sake of knowledge not great stuff the movie really builds up well almost too well as my one negative comment will show you will get a really strong sense that something of major importance is going to be revealed if you keep watching out lead character complete with hallucinations quirkiness and the obligatory disdain for normal human contact we 're talking visions of brains that shriek and vibrating walls the lead character is great if not a little contrived at times by the actor i mean he 's getting revelations to the meaning of life the universe and everything by the swirling eddies in his coffee ! yes ! but i only gave pi 4 stars for a reason letdown i mentioned that this movie makes you feel like it 's building up to something so grand that it may even aid you in your own life i mean i was right there hook line and sinker but i was left on the line at the end the ending is n't bad but it seems like a max solves the problem by drilling a hole in his skull no more special gift no more math at the speed of thought no more secret formula or mystery dang i was disapointed i tried really hard not to be because the movie had me so enthralled but i did n't get the '' experience i was hoping for at the end however ! i would highly recomend you checking it out for yourself i 've spoken with a lot of folks who totally disagree with me and dig the ending great addition to your underground pick it up ! ste
the main character is a paranoid out of order lock in mathamatician that never stops calculating but hold on there 's more to the story this guy is also an envelope pusher when the movie starts we realize that his character is not all together there he has frequent headaches and nightmares could be due to his condition when he was a little boy he stared up into the sun for a dangerous amount of time the doctors say that his pupils dialated to the size of pin holes but that 's not what the story is about the story is really about a set of numbers no one really knows what it is one says it 's random computer junk another thinks it 's part of a code one thinks it could help figure out the stock market a group of people think that it is a code for the actual name of god the real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists that 's what the character goes through if it is not a numerial code for good it be a numerial code for evil full of intrigue suspense and an interest in math the movie is in full black and white really wierd camera angles as well as some messed up scenes soundtrack is also weird like from the twighlight zone rent it if anything else enjoy
i must really commend the guys who put pi '' together in that the subject matter is quite interesting there were parts of the story that became obscured in the editing i suspect such as the role of the beautiful neighbor shekinah and it is never clear why our hero 's double was standing opposite him on the subway platform with a bloody hand at that point it became more of an artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story the use of music in the film was almost a complete waste it just did not work well the creators needed to incubate this more imho i enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story especially without the use of special effects still it is an interesting film to see
we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met this movie answers that question very well no cheesiness we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest great saturday evening movie
until alien v predator the best interaction was danny glover 's encounter with the in predator 2. it was a down to earth no pun intended face off between the hunter and the hunted but humans are predatory by nature we love the hunt the kill the challenge the aliens never stood a chance alien v predator now introduces the acid bleeding aliens we all got to know and love from that series of movies faced against these safari specialists with humans thrown in as a bonus some one fire up that grill ! it 's the perfect set up three races of creatures all pitting their ability to survive against the other no surpises though the bad guys lose the middle guys get a trophy and the humans win for now just do n't leave it this way for too long though we need another episode !
what a challenge ! to take two characters like aliens and predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge it is unimaginable each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us the audience the situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension the behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as the old curiosity shop so we revisit pyramid civilizations three aztec egyptian and cambodian and the great myth of all times the antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens the general idea is that the are the predators that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born for the hunt easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus that 's what we are told happened on october 10 1904 and is going to happen again on october 10 2004. unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt in a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators the result is absolutely perfect the human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators hence saving the world and the human race the details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular it reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation all those vain people who believe in money guns science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend this is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences but at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round the decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book i guess the dvd has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonn
i do n't care what people say i got it right off the bat what the movie was about i joy it as well alien predator kids it worked just fine for me you got to love predator butt those cool look aliens it 's fun watching i 'll enjoy years to come calling spaceship earth thank for the trip thanks for dropping me at back home based more on comic books alien predator '' not so much on passed alien movies or predator movies
theatrical version i thought it was stupid that they did n't stick to the r rated gore that the other alien and predator movies have but thats you get a fair ride that includes many refrences to the movies but just does n't deliver the excitment that alien and predator gave you unrated version not as gory as alien and predator but a big improvement over the theatrical version the cuts are gorier the chestbursters are gorier and the dead bodies are more disgusting
i am laughing at those 2 star reviews saying how avp is destroying the alien and predator legacy because of its nonexistent plot all i am going to say is this go back and watch alien and again before passing any judgment i did recently both has even less of a story than avp both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today those 2 star reviewers are comparing avp to how they remember alien and predator memories are doing a real number on them the only thing that avp lacks is originality however the story will continue sets the stage for sequels we should wait and see how it develops meanwhile enjoy the incredible cg and action sequences in short avp is an awesome 90 minute thrill ride that i am willing to take again and again and for the record paul anderson is a great director check out his resident evil 1 '' as another side note james cameron ranked avp as the best among the 5 alien movies after alien '' and his aliens ''
this was a real eye opener due to californias stringent air standards the auto makers were forced to enter into a venue that they were not happy with and ultimately would see the demise of how sad to deprive the united states of this functioning technology due to the governments and auto makers refusal to support it both with infrastructure and legislation
in a film that will make you angry and disheartened director chris paine explores the ominous confluence of big business and government and their efforts to get rid of the electric car which ten years ago looked as though it was going to set the automotive world on fire the reasons behind the electric car 's disappearance include corporate collusion and greed governmental spinelessness and oil company propaganda this does documentary does an excellent job of laying out what actually happened when general motors terminated all leases of its fleet of fast sleek ev 's the vehicle was never made available for purchase the company ended up sending them to the crusher as honda toyota and ford also would pull their fleets off the streets determined to find out who ultimately was responsible stopping production paine cleverly structures his movie like a murder mystery lining up the list of suspects and then methodically going through them in addition to the car companies and obviously the oil companies who have grown accustomed to selling nearly 3 billion gallons of gas a week fingers are also are pointed at the california air resources board which backed off of its original zero emission vehicle mandate under pressure from the auto industry and the bush administration go figure while paine himself a lessee is unabashedly partial to the promise of technology over petrol he includes interviewees who do n't even agree a crime ever occurred and they argue that there was just lack of demand which ended the scant supply of course oil companies ran ads claiming that the electric car was an environmental hazard and the public was just too shortsighted to see through the lies later the oil companies and the car manufacturers bought the rights to the electric car battery technology and as paine gathers such converts as tom hanks mel gibson peter horton and alexandra paul who talk about the advantages of having the car and how great it actually was we see the gradual collusion of corporate and government interests gradually unfold who killed the electric car makes a compelling case that the current discussion of hydrogen cell technology as the successor to the internal combustion engine but the movie also makes the point that hydrogen technology is n't nearly as efficient as electrical technology the hydrogen cell is still decades away from being perfected whilst the electric car was close to being practical the cars were actually on the road ! and although the film ends on an optimistic note with the current popularity of hybrid vehicles it 's still upsetting to see all these new clean electric cars a hope for the future being crushed mangled and shredded mike leonard november 06
i saw this movie in the theater and i thought it was quite an eye opener some may say it shows an imbalanced view in favor of electric cars but what happened to kill the electric car was anything but balanced the movie shows how car makers put a technological wonder on the road a car that meets 90 of our motoring needs with little maintenance and no more trips to the gas station it tells a story of how the car 's inventors with help from the oil industry and their combined influence over government systematically raised doubts rather then educating on the virtues of the ground breaking technology it left me sadly realizing that a player in the beleaguered us car industry had a head start against foreign competitors but eagerly wasted it
i drove the for five years so some might say i am not exactly objective on this subject be that as it may this movie utterly demolishes gm 's lame propaganda that nobody wants to drive an ev gm fully the to fail while it may have cost a billion dollars to develop that was small potatoes compared to the value to gm of destroying california 's mandate and keeping it from spreading to other states despite extreme scarcity highly restrictive lease terms and nearly advertising the became an unexpected success the unbridled enthusiasm of its drivers splendidly depicted in this movie so embarassed gm that they eventually recalled and destroyed every with a vindictiveness that stunned even those of us who thought we harbored no illusions about gm 's motives the may be dead a victim of corporate greed and but no one who has ever thought seriously about the subject can doubt that the ev will return the only open question is hopefully this movie will remain as an inspiration and help make that day sooner rather than later
this movie shows the travesty of the combustion engine and the pity of the demise of the brilliant electric car a fun movie for any thinking person who cares about the environment and a frustrating one too
what a movie ! like me an inconvenient truth and fahrenheit this one pulls at your intellect and gut to see many heros and villains and expect justice the premise gm and other car manufacturers were making fully functional 100 electric cars less than a decade ago then with the california air resources board decision to withdraw the requirement that of cars sold in california pass the zero emissions test and a possible behind the scenes conspiracy with a variety of players promoting the california fuel cell partnership the and other electric cars die literally hundreds of fully functioning cars were smashed and shredded zero of these original cars are on the road today zero ! they had all been leased and the auto companies called them all to car heaven even though the folk leasing them offered cash to keep them do not let a single politician be elected without clarifying their role in this debacle never let your concerns for global warming human health and national security be held ransom by the gas and automobile cartels it 's up to you
this movie exposed some serious problems with industry and government alike and demonstrated why we have made so little progress in reducing our dependence on oil but it actually also exposed the general apathy that allows these problems to continue as with the electric car the movie itself did not generate much interest notwithstanding it is a really interesting movie it ties nicely with the title of who killed the electric car '' by looking at the suspects which include car companies oil companies consumers government the california air resources board carb battery technology and fuel cells the actions of gm in scrapping the electric car and destroying its remnants make it look sinister and there appears to be a serious conflict of interest for a number of government officials who have had positions in the oil and auto industry one interesting point in this movie is whether fuel cells will be really ever be viable it raises the question as to whether the hype about fuel cells is really a diversion by the auto and oil industries to delay any real progress in developing a battery powered electric car which can effectively compete with gasoline powered cars the movie questions the motives of the california air resources board in eliminating its zero emissions vehicle mandate which required 2 of the vehicles sold in california to be emissions free by 1998 and 10 emissions free by 2003. unbelievably the chairman of the california air resources board subsequently became the chairman of the california fuel cell partnership which makes his actions that ultimately eliminated battery powered electric vehicles appear to be an incredible conflict of interest this movie is thought provoking and easy to watch hopefully it will help inspire the comeback of the electric car at least one small company tesla motors is now making a highly road worthy albeit expensive at this point electric car
this engrossing documentary surprises viewers on a number of levels and offers a broad range of interviewees and perspectives personally as a grad student focusing on the nation 's addiction to oil the majority of which goes into personal transportation i see who killed the electric car '' as a film useful in propelling dialogue and motivating consumers to demand more from staid us automakers petroleum dependency and all its attendant issues from securitizing oil reserves around the globe to environmental degradation can be addressed with technology and leadership as stan ovshinsky inventor of nimh batteries remarks in the film '' if you want to change the world do n't grab a gun do what we do and change the world with science and technology
i bought the dvd for my daughter 's birthday both she and my old love the movie they sing the songs from it all day long
i 'm not a big fan of tom or demi and jack even wears out his welcome in some films but not here the supporting roles are superbly done the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a or so here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years i enjoy the script because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force
the dvd is great lots of subtitle options not to mention the fact that the movie is just simply amazing with a great cast
around a brutal and mysterious murder of a soldier a young attorney will be sent to investigate this dark and bitter incident a curious honor code seems to exist hovering the subordinates who will try to cover up all the clues with the only intention to preserve the moral and good costumes but slowly the truth will make its glamorous appearance despite the efforts leading to a trail where the confrontation among these two men tom cruise as the good guy in search of the truth and jack nicholson as the obsessed man who behind all his exhibited intolerance and nasty behavior will not be able to avoid to an admirable tricky to hide what was going on that horrid evening when the rules had to be broken in service of a distorted order according the famous statement of the leopard giovanni de lampedusa everything must change in order to remain unalterable '' if strangelove was a demolishing advertence genially narrated about the miscarried conduct and deplorable evasion of the reality and transfer of guilty over imaginary events to justify his own fluids lacks or in the case of apocalypse now '' led us to the darkest corners of the febrile madness of a colonel and all his command who lost the coordinates of the real world a few good men '' recreates once more with admirable efficacy and detailed description the pernicious and eccentric state of mind of a general to whom the moral codes are handled according his own convenience being able to transform and dislocate them according his doubtful points of view the well known rules of the game powerful script arresting camera angles and one of the most pyramidal performances of jack nicholson ever made of this film not only a cult movie but a firm candidate among the ten best films of the decade and obviously the masterpiece of rob reiner
i could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the of this movie is about or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film and find out that way most of you probably know it by now as it is a few good men is on my and my wife 's list of top ten movies of all time plenty of good reasons as it has been said in many other reviews the acting in this film from all the supporting actors as well is excellent the story is good too interesting actually it would be easy to look at this movie as simply a blockbuster '' kind of movie essentially it is it 's got talent in front of and behind the camera made a hell of alot of money at the box office so yes it 's a blockbuster '' but it 's also a damn good story as mentioned before another thing i liked about this movie was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between tom cruise and demi moore 's characters most other films on this scale would have done and i know it 's been said in many other reviews but i 'm going to say it again anyway nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie no not because of that famous you ca n't handle the truth '' line but because his acting really is that good it seems so natural his mannerisms are so natural that he could pass for a real life military leader am in the military myself so i can vouch for this and even though this movie is over two hours i was never once bored wo n't be either
this is not a review of a few good men as such but rather a review of its excellent director rob reiner i 've lost count of how many times i 've watched this movie it 's that good and there 's little point to my echoing the excellent reviews already posted here but the other day i decided to watch the movie with the director 's commentary on something i rarely do because too often the who do such commentaries yak on endlessly and wind up detracting from the movie rather than adding insight to it not so with the director 's commentary of a few good men reiner shows wonderful restraint at the same time he adds information which will enhance my future viewings of this movie for example even though i was aware of the fact the clear sexual tension between the cruise and moore characters is never allowed to reach ahem climax i was not aware this was a conscious choice on the part of the movie 's makers i credit them with good sense and good taste for that choice and will relish the absence of groping hereinafter it might even help me to forget the memory lapses shown by rob reiner in his commentary he cites the confrontation between moore and cruise at the softball practice as 'the first meeting between the two ' it was not they actually met in her office earlier and he credits the drill team which provides the backdrop for the opening credits as having come from 'one of the north carolina universities ' it was actually texas a m according to the credits but one fact often repeated in this commentary that will not be easily forgotten and will i 'm sorry to say detract from my enjoyment of the movie in subsequent viewings is reiner 's confession that he saw an opportunity in the original broadway play to make a movie not so much about military life and military justice but about the struggle of an intelligent and upwardly mobile young man trying to get out from under 'the shadow of a more famous father ' i find this rather sad certainly a great deal can be said of rob 's father carl reiner but i personally felt rob had already 'made his mark ' long before he directed a few good men in yet nearly 10 years after directing this excellent movie the man is still tied up in knots over this 'i 've got to be better than my dad ' trip one ca n't help but wonder how much better all the way to five stars a movie this might have been if rob were more content to be his own man
sorry after reading some negative reviews i just had to speak up this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen i still to this day watch it over and over again well directed some of the best acting i have seen and my god the cast in this movie the list of stars is endless the courtroom scenes were so intense i envey anyone who has not seen this yet the story was perfect and so many surprises and turns really well done this movie is worth every penny i just wish i would of got to see it in the movies it is the most powerful movie i have ever seen how can anyone say this movie was not good i guess they just ca n't handle the
as always with amazon i recieved my purchase in perfect condition
there are some great courtroom scenes in this movie that are so powerful and the acting is fantastic the story of honor and pride in one 's country and way of life is an inspiration for anyone who is a believer in truth justice and the american way
the military courtroom drama '' a few good men '' is one of those films that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it 's own but even with countless viewings it retains it 's emotional power and speaks to us about issues that have become more important than ever in the film we meet daniel kaffee tom cruise a young successful military lawyer who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases that supposably he 's never even seen the inside of a courtroom '' he is assigned the cases of pfc louden downey james marshall and lance cpl harold dawson wolgang bodison they are accused of murder and a host of other charges when at the guantanamo bay military base they performed a code red '' an illegal form of discipline within a military unit on pvt william sandiago which unintentionally resulted in his death while the two accused marines admit they did the code red '' both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors which includes base commander nathan jessup a brillaint jack nicholson a powerful highly decorated officer who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command with both time running out and a lack of legal evidence kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy through a brilliant script based on the play by aaron sorkin rob reiner 's steady direction and the cast 's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as code honor discipline '' should a soldier always follow orders no matter what whats ' more important our ethics principles on which this country was founded or our need for security is jessup right can we not handle the truth '' it 's hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1992. in this post post abu grebbe world where our country is on a war footing the questions that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever the film is filled with great performances while i am not normally a huge tom cruise fan i have to admit that cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer the same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from demi moore kevin bacon and kiefer sutherland but what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant dynamic performance that comes from jack nicholson when cruise puts nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on you just watch in awe as nicholson just continually builds the character 's palpable anger until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous you ca n't handle the truth '' speech even though the speech and nicholson 's performance has been endlessly quoated parodied when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance if you are interested in seeing a well made movie courtroom drama that is both thought provoking and entertaining then i highly recommend a few good men ''

there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story what did the macho man think about it unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth would these be included in a future macho man dvd set i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy especially in front of a huge live audience including kids i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80 's yes that 's hardcore deadly scary hardcore ! that should not happen in the first place the story involving steamboat is well covered it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing there should be a line which should not be crossed how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head human error hm nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today 's standard enough is enough we do n't need accidents ! they may be an unevitable part of sports but not part of entertainment ''
i did n't think the time that they were going to release a dvd on jake roberts but after i watched this the first time i 'm glad they did first things first jake roberts no matter what kind of personal problems he may have had in the past the guy is a true legend this dvd is as in depth as any wwe dvd i 've recently purchased it gave me certain information about jake that i did n't previously know the documentary portion of the dvd is awesome and it 's required viewing for all fans especially long time fans like me here 's my review on the extra matches disc one matches ricky steamboat snake pit match the big event jake and steamboat had a great feud around this time and this is one of the highlights of that feud one of jake 's best matches honky tonk man wrestlemania iii still a shocking upset to this day honky tonk beat jake in this match still watchable though ravishing '' rick rude rude awakening ddt match msg another great feud during this time for roberts rude was after jake 's wife the time and the result was a hot storyline jake got the win in this one snakes bites extras jake 's relationship with children how he became the snake '' working with dynamite kid legion of doom '' steamboat saved my life '' meeting dick ebersol '' snake '' on the loose grizzly smith feud easter eggs on disc one in the chapters section click right twice on growing up '' for jake telling a personal story about being worked by his father after a match in the snake bites section click right twice on legion of doom '' for a clip of animal finishing the story he started about king kong bundy on the snake bites clip in the snake bites section click left twice on grizzly smith '' for a clip of hulk hogan talking about an experience he had with jake 's father on a road trip disc 2 matches ricky steamboat jim nelson mike miller average match but watchable ronnie garvin world tv title georgia championship not a bad match but they did show some energy in this one leaping '' lanny poffo msg jake 's debut match in the wwf pretty average to say the least earthquake superstars no match once things appear to get going earthquake squashes '' jake 's snake in the bag actually sitting on it after a match jake the snake '' roberts attacks randy macho man '' savage with a cobra superstars sting coal miners glove match halloween havoc another fairly average match worth a look to see jake face sting for the first last time dirty white boy smokey mountain title smokey mountain wrestling not very good but stone cold '' steve austin king of the ring if it was n't for this match there would be no stone cold steve austin bottom line watch austin 's promo the end of this match jerry the king '' lawler summerslam dud pretty much a squash almost jake quickly disposes of lawler with the ddt during tommy dreamer jerry the king '' lawler hardcore heaven tommy dreamer justin credible jack victory november 2 remember this is your standard ecw match interviews promos vince mcmahon interviews jake tnt '' ravishing '' rick rude hits on cheryl roberts superstars brother love interviews jake cheryl roberts wrestling challenge promo about threatening ted dibiase with snakes superstars fights with brother love during interview superstars interview on the barber shop wrestling challenge ultimate warrior casket vignette superstars ultimate warrior cemetery vignette superstars ultimate warrior room vignette superstars mean gene okerlund interviews jake superstars the snake pit kamala the wizard kim chee wrestling challenge junkyard dog wrestling challenge hulk hogan wrestling challenge dvd bonus excerpts from various books by wwe legends including superstar billy graham tangled ropes '' jerry lawler it 's good to be the king sometimes '' freddy blassie listen you pencil neck geeks '' ! disc 2 easter eggs click left twice on with ricky steamboat jim nelson and mike miller '' for a steamboat and roberts promo regarding this match click right twice on ronnie garvin '' for a gordon solie interview of paul ellering and jake roberts from georgia championship wrestling cleck left twice on earthquake '' for a clip from superstars on april 1991 where roberts spooks tenta and jimmy hart with the snake overall i have a few comments 1 if you want this dvd for the matches only and you 're looking for quality and you 're not into the old school wrestling this dvd is not for you 2 if you 're a nostagic fan such as myself and you like the classic wwf footage and matches to boot high recommendation 3 if you 're just a fan of jake roberts overall another high recommendation in the end you wo n't go wrong with this purchase
this dvd really lets you in on the insight of jake roberts he was one of the most unique characters in his heyday and with his commentary on this it really stands out tremendously the kind of things i learned from him especially in his youth and his drug and alcohol abuse he grew up rough in every sense of the word now i have a better understanding of he became bitter at times overall it 's an excellent dvd that has most of his classic matches when i first saw him get hit with the guitar by the honky tonk man i thought he was faking the shot to make it look real and i even laughed at it until he said that guitar was inch thick and then i looked at the clip again and i thought damn it really almost killed him he had a lot of guts to continue to wrestle that type of commentary along with other things he touched up on really gave it a sense of realism of the pro wrestling lifestyle overall i recommend this dvd to add to your collection
awesome dvd ! jake roberts tells you everything from origin of the ddt to the drug addiction to the last time he appeared on wwe television this is definitely a must have ! jake the snake is a true legend and deserves to in the hall of fame maybe it will happen in 2006
at first i was n't going to buy this dvd i did n't really care or know a whole lot about the career of jack roberts then i saw it used at a local game stop store for 11 i could n't refuse the doc is great i knew that he does or did drugs i learned alot about the man and his hard up bringing as for the extras there are tons i found three or four hiddden easter eggs if you can find this used buy it
a stroll down memory lane with one of the most interesting wrestlers by far it was worth 5 stars if i had any complaint it would be be overuse of the younger jake '' double drinking at the bar and popping pills a few times got the point across they could have used that time to throw in a couple more snake pit segments as extras no one is ever happy with all the matches presented of course or all the footage the only two bits i would have liked to see was that blindfolded versus blindfolded rick martel and jake roberts match and also footage from the one saturday night 's main event when honky tonk man dressed as kimchi and attacked jake but then later at the end when jake got his revenge with damion still excellent fun ! my only other question now is where the hell is a rowdy roddy piper dvd
the first time i watched in good company i said to myself eh not good not bad just pretty average a couple reviews reflect that but ever since hbo started playing the movie constantly i find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more the best quality about this film is that it 's real you watch the story progress and you feel like you 're watching reality i never found myself saying how unrealistic that could never happen the character 's emotions seem real the situations seem real that all points to a film also the movie does n't try too hard it does n't go out of its way to be funny does n't go out of its way to give you a sappy predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of hollywood fantasy
not a typical no brainer movie this movie presents complex people with complex motives topher grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways he is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life this lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife he focuses on his job even though he is n't passionate about the work quaid does not like his demotion yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and does n't try to sabatoge him this is where the film differs from other inferior movies he is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it he even tries to help his new boss the love story is played with honesty since quaid 's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone yet she 's attracted to her dad 's new boss do n't expect cheap laughs and simple answers
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70 's show ' which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd grace plays a 26 executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend he 's become such a machine in a competivie world that he 's loses his way in life i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too one of mentor 's has told me repeatedly that the can be one of the roughest times in life so many things are going at once on so many levels to me this movie captured that paul weitz did a great job writing this the cast was exquisite
i always this dislike those raunchy humor comedies always with some expections like harold and kumar many to list but in good company is a very original movie and fits perfectly as comedy and drama there is never a dull or slow moment in the whole movie all the chacters are likeable topher is a pretty good actor and he has a great future as a comedian by the way i think topher is a great choice for eddie brocks in 3 he is very funny in that 70 show '' too scarlett was excellent i never see a bad movie from her with no dobut one the best young actress in the actual hollywood the story is great and original drama works fine the direction also is very good and the movie skips any raunchy joke in my opinion in good company by far is one the best comedies i ever seen and one my favorites comedies too i gon na buy my copy ! acting direction story overall
dennis quaid ranks high in our family video night both the parent trap and the rookie are among our young children 's favorites for my wife and i i rented in good company due to quaid and because the film intrigued me its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy it was different from most of what i see in good company relies on its characters i do n't know the corporate world but as corporations seem to be today 's resident evil '' pun intended i liked a story where a heart is found in the oz less world of layoffs and cubicles what i liked most was the interaction between dan forman played by quaid and carter duryea played by topher grace carter is fatherless basically he 's parentless and the film shows a close foreman family but has little and little positive reference to carter 's upbringing carter 's world is psyche synergy cell phones and sports america where he now runs sales as the film progresses we are treated not just to an old school the hill tension but see a young man learn character in work and family from someone who has done it right there are limitations as when foreman tells duryea that the secret to a good marriage is to find the right woman and keep your organ in your pants when you are away from home this is not too helpful for carter whose marriage to the wrong woman shows a need for more than luck but overall he learns that life is more than suits cars and success he longs for he does not have throughout we see the pain of a young man all alone in the world someone who has had no one to guide him in one scene morty played by david paymer states that the right timing is important the film could easily have dived into a happy ending where everyone has a job and where carter gets the girl but it makes a good move by remaining true to that line when carter hugs foreman goodbye he squeezes him and breaks down when we next see carter he is jogging outside rather than on a treadmill he may not know where his path will lead but now thanks for dan foreman he is no longer running in circles
upon seeing previews at the theater for in good company my first instinct was to avoid it like the plague based on the apparent target demographic for this film it was marketed horribly the trite title and kitchy manner in which the preview clips were edited reminded me too much of those shallow adoloescent throwaway disney films the type hollywood routinely pukes out for 14 year old girls and knowing dennis quaid 's penchant for appearing in such films i assumed in good company was another one of those recently however i stumbled across the movie 's opening credits on hbo i 'll stay long enough to make fun of it i thought to myself but in a matter of minutes i was completely sucked in the writing was intelligent and the tone often dark this is a movie that on the surface appears to be a natural born comedy yet it resists the obvious cornball pitfalls at every turn the characters are not 1 dimesnional buffoons but are written to be very believable people with real problems every time i smelled a cliche or overly sentimental twist coming the film continued to surprise me by not taking the easy way out is it a perfect film no in good company is not without its flaws but they are very few and very forgivable this one is proof that you ca n't judge a dvd by its cover
in good company is n't a hilarious comedy nor a serious '' drama yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005 pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch the story is about a sales exec dennis quaid who 's company is sold with demotion and a new boss topher grace a young half his age and pathetically callow though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth the new boss even naively falls for his older worker 's daughter oblivious to the obvious impracticality so without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline what makes in good company so interesting two things i think one the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy like the simpsons but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that 's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation second the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing like you want to know these people and root for their friendship you do n't see that done well in the movies often and this is probably the most effective case since cary grant and ronald coleman in talk of the town in which they were in a romantic triangle with jean arthur so it 's really not the same situation i 'm afraid you 'll just have to watch the movie to see what i mean
i loved this movie the acting was great and the their interactions throughout the movie interesting its amazing how some movies just do n't have the ability to keep my interest but this one definitely pulled me in right from the start and built as the movie progressed very enjoyable and with some good laughs
i wanted to see a movie one evening and it really did n't matter what movie i just wanted to get out of the house and get to a theater i looked at the listings and decided to see in good company '' and i 'm certainly glad i did i found this movie to be very entertaining and very enjoyable to watch i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well in a way this movie was also an on todays ' corporate america and its ' all too often pitfalls nicely produced acted and directed
the star wars trilogy are my favorite movies of all time to be able to own the first edition of it 's dvd release is a star wars fan 's dream come true
these films look really good cleaned up only thing george should n't of was the scene in episode 4 the han walking over jabbas tail scene in episode 4 and the change to the end scene in episode 6 at the end where yoda and anakin are all standing together smiling at luke replacing the old darth vader with the actor from episode 3 was just plain out dumb
my favorite movie is starwars trilogy it is about the dark side and the good side it takes place in the future it is set in space i liked it because it has action and love it is also funny and is cool all people would like the movie because it is about science and space i give it a thumbs up
anyone whose read my previous star wars '' reviews know i 've been very hard with george whore of hollywood '' lucas and the whole direction he took the first trilogy on i do n't care if it was reflective of his original vision '' i get the feeling we 'll need another prequel to figure out just what the heck was going on is that what he meant to do who knows i was also a kid when the first trilogy came out and absolutely loved it and yet i think folks are being a little too critical of the changes made in this dvd set honestly i also liked the updated special effects on the cinematic reissues for the i think anniversary so let 's get the crap out of the way the changes lucas made for the dvd necessary some yes some no it was nice to see ian mcdiarmid being the emperor in empire strikes back '' sorry revill i at least hope you still get royalties and the script rewrites make more sense now given what we know of the backstory but still but still did n't need boba fett 's dialogue redubbed we also did n't need even more stormtroopers for han solo to run away from another thing that not only we did n't need but was unnecessary and puzzling replacing sebatian shaw at the end of return of the jedi '' with hayden christiansen why and why not replace alec guinness with ewan macgregor to make it a matched set my biggest complaint is with other star wars '' veterans why did n't lucas include the originals with the altered ones i guess we all know the answer to this one but it bothers me still the changes however are minor and do n't get in the way of the goodness that are the original trilogy of films the bonus disc is a nice touch as well bringing the sheer joy of goodness up to date with what made him famous it was good to see they added and expanded on empire of dreams '' since they showed a version of it first on a e one does n't get the feeling of reheated leftovers that sometimes accompanies a dvd which throws an epk or hbo '' doc as a special feature '' add in the commentary good overall great still galleries and excellent promo spots it was way cool to see the tv ad for star wars '' i remember back again and it 's a good buy i hope though that lucas resists putting out any more special limited editions '' oh well one can hope
this is n't the original theatrical versions but the later computer enhanced special editions '' that makes me just a little sad one of the great things about those original editions was finding how many bloopers you could spot who could forget luke skywalker landing his after blowing up the death star and shouting carrie '' not leia at the top of his lungs ! the special editions got rid of all that great human trivia still i 've purchased this trilogy as a gift for my daughter and a trip down nostalgia lane for me when the movie first came out i really did n't pay much attention to it it 's probably hard for younger audiences to believe but star wars '' was originally a largely underground hit the studio did n't mount any massive ad campaign for it and it 's popularity grew mostly through word of mouth as the film was literally entering it 's last week of release a friend took me to the central city mall now defunct in san bernardino to see it like most others i was stunned by the opening graphics the pan from the surface of tatooine to the small diplomatic ship to the huge star destroyer in blazing pursuit was inspired and effectively changed science fiction films forever it would be years before i saw the original star wars again remember this was before you could see any movie and be sure that it would be released on vhs or dvd in less than six months so star wars fans had to wait for years well at least two my memory fails me for the empire strikes back '' to me this was and is the best of all the star wars films i saw this one at least a dozen times the that launches empire '' luke attacked by the wampa and using the force to kill it han venturing out in the face of certain death to rescue his friend and so on became a spielberg trademark but lucas did it here first these introductory vignettes have since gone on to become a staple of the genre showcased at their best in the indiana jones '' trilogy the sudden and unexpected sexual tension in the triangle of luke leia and han made this movie instantly provocative and riveted my teenaged attention in the original star wars the suggestion was that luke and leia were an item '' putting han into the mix was an inspired twist of course the revelation that darth was luke 's father and leia 's brother made this an instant hit those were happy days idyllic in hindsight when all you had to worry about was how long you had to stand in line and whether or not you could get the perfect seats center aisle a few rows back and revel in the newly released thx sound following the plot so closely that you could literally quote the dialog along with the film ! i still have my vhs copy of star wars '' and the empire strikes back '' and i drag them out from time to time just to remember days gone by just for the record i still feel that return of the jedi '' was the weakest of the three it felt like george was tired of the series and just wanted to tie up all the loose ends when i finally get the dvd 's er that is borrow them from my daughter it 's going to feel a little strange to be sitting in my den with a 50 inch hdtv listening to thx grade but i believe a little of that earlier magic will still come through
this trilogy is great i wished i got this when it first came out this trilogy dvd box set is worth every penny you put in to it it 's like watching the todays star wars movies ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
if you love sixteen candles '' this should be part of your library as a true classic if you 've never seen sixteen candles this is a must see and you 'll want to see it more than once with so many sight gags excellent character acting and direction and a happy ending to boot you 'll want this one in your dvd library to enjoy over and over
i do n't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained i do n't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up critique it 's only a movie i either enjoy it or i do n't i laugh as hard at this in my as i did in my it 's just a hysterically funny flick !
this is n't the type of movie that will make you reflect and question your life 's ambitions it 's designed to make you laugh i think it succeeds admirably molly ringwald is perfect as the budding teenager ready to have life meet her she is surrounded by a quirky forgetful family complete with a jerk for a younger brother nerdy boys desperate for her attention good friends with whom she can be herself and naturally a love interest anthony michael hall 's character is as funny a dorky kid as i 've ever seen his dance moves are legendary ! he has several monologues that still bring out genuine laughs from me even after all these years of watching this classic this is a teen movie so go in with your expectations at that level and you may be pleasantly surprised that you enjoy watching this movie for years to come
molly ringwald stars in this classic movie about coming of age and high school crushes ringwald stars as samantha her sixteenth birthday just happens to be the day before her sister 's wedding unfortunately for sam everyone has forgotten about her birthday due to the stress of the upcoming wedding sam 's house is overflowing with relatives who have come in from out of town to attend the wedding both sets of grandparents have arrived and sam has been kicked out of her room one set of grandparents have brought along a chinese foreign exchange student whom they have been sponsoring his name is long duc dong gedde watanabe sam 's grandmother seems to think it would be a good idea for long to accompany sam to her school dance so off they go meanwhile sam is being pursued by the geek '' played by anthony michael hall he has been coming on very strong but its all an act to be cool in his friends ' eyes sam has a crush of her own his name is jake ryan justin henry sam revealed her feelings about jake on a sex test '' that one of her friends gave her jake gets ahold of the test and immediately becomes intrigued with meeting sam however he 's dating the most popular girl in the school but according to jake all she likes to do is party true to her form she organizes a huge party at jake 's house only to get so drunk that she passes out jake asks the geek to drive her safely home but more happened than just driving will jake and sam end up together will sam 's parents realize that they forgot her birthday i can remeber seeing this movie when i was in high school and its just as i remember it gedde watanabe 's portrayal of long duc dong is the highlight of the movie john and joan cusack even have bit parts the cool soundtrack of great songs is excellent as well i highly recommend this movie the acting is very good especially by hall and watanabe and the story is very funny i 'm sure that many people have had their family forget their birthday watch this funny film about growing up long duc dong will keep you laughing too !
this movie was great i loved it ! one of the best movies from the 80 's !
this movie is fantastic it should be mandatory on everyones dvd list it 's so funny and fun and it stars two of the best from the 80 's brat pack molly ringwald and anthony michael hall molly ringwalds character samantha is about to turn 16 just at the exact same time her older sister is about to get married in all the commotion her birthday is forgotten and ruined her grandparents so cute come to stay at their house and bring along a hilarious asian exchange student with them she is forced to go along to the school dance and take the exchange student with her and there at the dance anthony michael hall king of the nerds has a wager with his nerd friends including a very young john cusack that he can get her pants by the end of the night and will show them to all the nerds in the bathroom there is actually a very tender scene in a car at the 'car workshop ' classroom where he and sam have a bit of a heart to heart she reveals her secret crush jake the hottest guy in school one thing leads to another and the rest of the movie is spent with the 'will they wo n't they get together ' with a predictable ending albeit happy and fun this is a great movie that i never get tired of long duc dong the exchange student steals every scene he is in he is so funny fans of er got to see him again as he had a minor role each week for a long while back this is a cool movie that i highly recommend because it 's absolutely great and to me it will always be a classic
this is a classic teen romantic comedy from 1984. hard to believe it is now 22 years old as of 2006 ! molly ringwald is mad for jake whose dating the womanly caroline while a geek pursues molly sweet sixteen is sour sixteen as her family forgets her birthday and her older sister 's wedding eclipses everything it still seems relevant now that we are all into the late 30 's and makes many of us sigh with relief that we are long gone from high school and never to return
set it middle america in the mid sixteen candles is the story of samantha baker and the day she turned 16. written by first time director john hughes and starring then teen queen molly ringwald this is a dvd for anyone who appreciates coming of age films almost like a modern day jane austen and the recent films that are based on her novels clueless hughes and sixteen candles successfully depict timeless teenage predicaments that anyone who has ever been young can relate to sixteen candles takes place over the course of two days which includes the birthday of a suburban teenage girl whose family is too overwhelmed by their oldest daughter 's pending nuptials the next day to remember the lead character 's rite of passage birthday with a soundtrack of new wave music sixteen candles perfectly captures life in suburban american during the the cast includes anthony michael hall who plays a nerdy guy who ringwald 's character justin henry the hunky senior whom samantha has a crush on and john and joan cusack who in small roles play random geeky high school kids on the outskirts of the popular crowd there are also great performances by the two sets of grandparents who horrify samantha baker and the chinese exchange student who accompanies her to a school dance though i have seen and enjoyed this film many times since it was first released with older eyes and ears i am somewhat shocked by the scene where jake ryan the hunk allows his drunken girlfriend to be pretty much raped by the anthony michael hall character in these politically correct times i doubt this scene would ever be included in a film still by masterfully capturing teen insecurities sixteen candles is a fantastic film that will long be remembered as ringwald 's finest work though hughes went on to even greater directorial success in the wildly popular home alone '' in many ways this is a better representation of his genius if for no other reason because it offers a timeless take on the complicated distressing lives of teenagers regina mcmenami
sixteen candles '' was the first film collaboration between john hughes and molly ringwald and started a very profitable franchise for both ringwald and hughes ringwald stars as samantha sam '' baker a teen who is turning sixteen unfortunately for her at the same time her spoiled indulged and fairly shallow older sister jenny blanche baker is getting married sam wakes up on her birthday expecting her body to blossom and everything to be roses unfortunately her own family forgets and it appears that she is going to have a miserable birthday additionally the nerdy farmer ted '' anthony michael hall has developed a crush on sam while sam pines away for dreamy jake ryan michael schoeffling who is quite involved with the pampered princess caroline havilland morris what makes this movie such a staple for any fan is not just the john ringwald connection but the appearance of anthony michael hall john cusack in a small but early film role the unforgettable long duck dong and the sympathy shown to sam 's plight who did n't have a crush on the most unobtainable guy in high school who did n't pine away for that senior who seemed to have it all including the perfect girlfriend what girl did n't go thru high school awaiting that perfect '' sixteenth birthday sam 's problems are to her as with most teens but hughes does n't gloss over it or make them seem trivial he sympathizes with sam 's plight and the plight of teen girls everywhere whose biggest tragedy is not getting that car for their sixteenth birthday or that popular guy not being interested in them in keeping with hughes ' later films all of the action is over the course of a day or two so the problems '' are fairly quickly resolved perhaps not highly realistic but more satisfactory also not highly realistic in most teen worlds is the incredibly decent and moral character of the jake ryan would any other popular guy upon intercepting a note naming him as sam 's biggest crush keep that to himself would he really want to dump his popular sexually active girlfriend because he wants more than a party maybe not in reality but in a teen girl 's dream world this is exactly what would happen and so ultimately sixteen candles '' is a fantasy film a fantasy that teen girls everywhere in the ate up and made molly ringwald their poster girl highly recommended for a nostalgic look back at molly anthony michael hall a young john cusack and the adorable michael schoeffling
this is some juicey stuff alright ! the women are very much the milf material that most men dream about and it seems like they have no limit to their appetites for trouble like they have absolutely no moral consiousness and that there is no limit to their stupidity all of which makes for great drama and especially great free television when you can watch it on dvd without commercials it is sooooo worth it
i am waiting for the season i am married with 2 children and i can see my thinkings way of life my ex loves in side the movie thank
the first few episodes were a bit dragging but eventually it picked up and the story became very interesting and funny it is indeed very entertaining and you can not wait for the next episode not to mention season
this is a very good tv show you have to hava it
rumour had it that the second season was weaker than the first do n't believe the hype there 's more dark secrets reversals of fortune crazy laughs and situations in these 24 episodes of a series that took the tv world by surprise crazy cameos ryan o'neal maria conchita alonzo new neighbors and bree going down at high speed tv series has never been that good since 6 feet under '' maybe all hail to the creator mark cherry on top ! olivier cachi
i like this series since the begging it 's my guilty pleasure i 'm always wondering what the desperate characters are going to do next i do recomend buying this box set and to watch disk number 6 with all the insight and deleted scenes you are going to love it
if you 've viewed season one and liked it and you must why would you even consider buying season 2 you will enjoy this second dvd though the first season was to me much more interesting and action packed probably because it was new and a fresh idea this season 's storylines continue to make surprise twists and turns just to watch eva longoria 's and marcia cross 's characters get what they want one way or another makes this a worthy purchase not a learning experience but excellent mindless entertainment ! !
the item ordered came way ahead of the scheduled date in excellent condition will do business with you over and over again
it 's hard to describe this great show it has everything comedy suspense drama mystery love stories but at the very core is a deep affection that binds all the women to each other they fight and argue but they are always there for each other when the chips are down
loved this season always keeps me on the edge of my seat cant wait for season three to come out onto dvd
one of my favorite comedies next to caddyshack and pee wee herman 's big adventure everytime i watch this film it cracks me up while i reminise about my days in louis in the early i have n't seen one white person in this movie and that 's what i love about it it 's an comedy that is one of the funniest movies ever created
i first watched friday on and on comedy central both however were edited the dvd allowed me to see more of the movie i recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie
every day is friday when you have no job funny good make you have a good laugh at the end of the da
looking forward to watching this r for pervasive strong language and drug use and for a brutal fight
even if it 's not necessarily the clean kind i must say that i was slightly skeptical about how much i 'd enjoy this movie but it turned out to be far better than expected it is a mix of humor and drama wherein the humor outweighs everything else friday is very unique as the characters stand above the generic ones hollywood usually offers ice cube is great and plays a straight man to chris tucker 's smokey the best parts of the film are when tucker speaks he has hilarious line after another the one thing i had to disagree with as far as the descriptions of this movie go is that it is devoid of any moral element this is n't a typical stoner celebration of weed because only after ice cube smokes the smoke does everything really fall apart for him he nearly ruins his chance with a girl he really likes and then well i wo n't give any of the plot away yet his dad 's insistence that there is never a reason to use a gun turns out to be valuable advice and should any kids who see this film reflect on it hopefully they 'll reconsider pulling out the nine '' should they be stared down by their own deebo 's who knows even if it affected only one person it 'd be worth it a pleasant surprise overall
i own all three movies in the series and this one is simply the best this is the breakthrough performance of chriss tucker who was unknown at the time as well as ice cube 's first taste at film sucess after boys n tha hood the standout performance has to go hands down to chris tucker who carries the film along this is a sleeper hit and will be apreciated by all teenagers and adults arounf the world buy this film for youself and see it is a must own in any dvd collection and you wil not understand it until u see it d'mello australi
this is n't joseph i am his oldest daughter i love this movie and in my opinion this is the best friday movie ever the other ones were okay basically this movie shows a typical friday in the hood '' for craig ice cube and smokey chris tucker in this movie they have to deal with the neighborhood bully debo '' who jacks people for their money and ice '' my favorite part of the movie is when drug dealer big worm '' sends people to do a drive by '' in craig 's neighborhood because smokey was too busy smoking up the weed instead of selling it which he should n't do anyway ! it 's hilarious because smokey screams like a girl the whole time ! as it 's been said before the sequels are missing smokey '' the lovable chris tucker who will have you sprawled out on the floor laughing ! however mike epps does a good job of keeping the jokes coming in the sequels people get this movie it will have you saying thank god it 's friday ''
its pretty much a cliche to label an enjoyable movie a classic '' in my opinion very few actually deserve to be called that and this is one that does for me its the interplay between chris tucker and ice cube that makes it special there are so many aspects of this movie that every person who 's grown up in a black neighborhood can relate to unconsciously i substitute the characters in the movie to those i knew from around my block tucker a natural comedian is the undisputed star its strange for me to think that he was an unknown at the time the movie was made i just got finished watching it again and laughed just about as hard as when it first came out in the theaters this is the only one in the series that 's worth watching in my opinion they should have done whatever it took to get chris tucker on each of the succeeding movies and all of them would have been much better
like most people i saw this first on cable about the same time i saw sean penn 's directorial debut the indian runner '' i had a great respect for independent films like forever and one false move '' is among the best carl franklin is to be commended for putting the script billy bob tom epperson to film in a concise fashion i do n't agree with previous reviewers who thought it needed more ground this is indeed an original bill paxton in his first lead role is excellent and has n't been as good since though i liked his smarmy performance in true lies '' and the wonderful cynda williams won awards for her performance as the film score is legendary indeed peter haycock derek holt wrote a score that has been used in a whole bunch of cheesy films of the 90 's i do n't really know if it was original for this one but the use of the music by terry plumeri was effective and haunting billy bob was a fine psychotic and the most frightening performance of all came from michael beach as pluto never breaking a sweat as he slit a throat paxton really carries the film along with williams you really want these people to survive life might be like that a great exposition of good and evil and delivered in fine fashion by the wonderful carl franklin
i caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and i could not remember the name but i did know who stared in it so when i went online to get the name of this i was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly ! ! ! thanks again ! !
billy bob and stars in this tightly woven deeply textured thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from ca to ak combines the personal the interpersonal the deviant with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle this was on roger ebert 's top ten list the year it came out although there are a couple of plot flaws it works well enough to keep you anticipating the showdown '' because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny this is a rare type of film nowadays the kind that comes from the heart not from the sterile factories of programs and lunkhead studios
i saw ofm when it first came out over ten years back it was on cable the other day it still keeps me glued to the set bill paxton billy bob thornton michael beach work too bad this one did n't get more media and a larger audience
before i even get into my glowing review of this cult classic horror film i want to call a long overdue moratorium on the long winded reviews people read these to glean opinions and reviews of the film from like minded genre fans the brief succinct synopsis that amazon provides is enough to allow the reader to decide if he wants to check out the film the poorly written synopses are useless time consuming and they take up space you did n't write the film so chill out with the play by play please anyway that having been said this is pure cheesy schlocky 80 's horror all the elements are there bad special effects that elicit instant laughs a dorky horror freak best friend who bears a resemblance to paul from the wonder years a saucy older sister with even saucier friends and a young baby faced stephen dorff looking scared and perplexed for most of the film a far cry from his cocky arrogant james turn as deacon frost in 1998 's blade the final sequence with the giant demon rising from the hole is actually pretty impressive at least for a film made in that era worth buying the dark poe
i saw this movie the things that sitck out for me is the barbie doll to the eye and the dead workers in the wall it has a feeling to it and for some reason i 'll always love this flick
after i saw this film i went in my backyard and tried digging then my mom yelled at me now i 'm older and i am going to order this dvd the movie is awesome it 's a classic in my mind
i have yet to see this movie as an adult but i remember being aroung the age of 8 and being allowed to watch this by an uncle of mind babysitting one night and i about wet myself nightmares were a regular occurance after that night i 'm sure as an adult that ill wonder what i was thinking back then but if you are looking for a movie with effects before its time this is the one great film
cacopolus played by eli wallach is easily the best western to grace the silver screen his dry wit and useful sayings his grandfather used to say '' make him constant comic relief two friends rob a bank and head out of town with their money little do they know that their about to be duped by cacopolus an outlaw who know his way around money and redefines the word money laundering '' after being robbed the duo seek out their mustached theif following the trail of good deeds cacopolus does throughout the country side with their money
i like this film very much but when are they going to put the three sabata '' films on vhs or dvd lee van cleef made the first and third yul brynner made the second sabata and in some ways was the best ace high '' is a good film from the same mold of leone 's trilogy yet ace high '' sabata '' death rides a horse '' and others look second rate though in the same genre terence hill however does bring ace high '' up one notch the more i think about it
a part of this video was available through our cable company on demand i got tired of watching the other programs my son always seemed to choose over and over again so i put this on hoping it 'd be some good my son loved it ! he loved it so much i had to purchase it because he 'd ask for it all day long and they 'd taken it off cable someone had commented their daughter did n't like it and she was disappointed this video is an educational video it 's not a tv show like jay jay the jet plane it 's a way for you to educate your child about whatever they enjoy that 's what the big adventure series is if you 've ever owned a video from you 'd know that it 's a great alternative for people like me who 'd prefer to educate their child instead of just letting them mindlessly watch cartoons over and over again my son loves this video as well as the big train trip i 'm going to try the construction video and the fire station video i hope my son enjoys them as well as this one and the big plane trip
my son was 3 when he first saw the big plane trip and since then we have purchased several more titles from the big adventure series each video is so well presented that adults enjoy watching them along with the children they are well filmed and intelligently narrated i especially like the way children ask and answer questions on the video currently my son is in love with the big airshow we also have the big submarine the big aircraft carrier the big zoo and others they are pretty much a guaranteed hit and as well as children come away with more knowledge
plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie i 'd just like to add a note on the meaning of the title most people have ignored it one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up as an ex brit who grew up in scotland when i saw it some time ago i just automatically assumed something quite different first trainspotting is an actual hobby in britain remember that this is a small country with a dense and active rail network lots of people are really really interested in trains but trainspotting is kind of the very interest trainspotters stand around stations or major rail junctions or marshalling yards and just collect train facts usually engine numbers sometimes appearances of some particular kind of rolling stock that is all they do make lists ! or sometimes trade number lists with other spotters or exult in the size of their list so the image of a trainspotter is a person very conventional in outlook probably standing for hours in the rain in a shabby raincoat one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life ! collecting train numbers is basically pure obsession collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks or any of the thousand other odd things people collect sometimes has another dimension artistic interest investment etc train numbers lead nowhere so to me the title trainspotting '' was a sardonic reminder of the monotonous meaningless normal '' life that the guys were rebelling against and trying to escape from unwisely but desperately in their drug usage it was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted hope this was helpful would be interesting to hear from anyone associated with the movie if that 's right as i say it was just the automatic interpretation for me ps after reading many many reviews why is it that so many otherwise literate people just can not spell the words definite and definitely many keep thinking there 's an a in there somewhere one even wrote defiantly '' which gave an interesting and unintended twist and of course passed oh well
this is one of the greatest films to come out of the uk in the past 20 years that 's saying quite a bit considering the number of high calibre films the uk has come out with in the past 20 years there are numerous great reviews here on amazon therefore i will be brief i titled this as despair and rebirth '' what i mean by this is that the character mark renton ewan mcgregor finally comes to terms with his nature as a heroin addict and awakens to a new and better tomorrow and therefore gets a new lease on life a much better life moreover it is a new life that many of his friends never get in the film and the way the film depicts his life as a junkie along with his friends is nothing but depair you ca n't help feeling empathy for mark renton and you root for him to succeed in overcoming his terrible addiction this film is great because it does not gloss over the terrible and destructive nature of drug addiction and heroin in particular this film does not glorify drugs as one of the reviewers wrote on the contrary it gives the viewer the ugly truth about a life of addiction especially with the graphic scenes of how horrible the life of a junkie really is with the opening scenes dialogue of mark renton sarcastically mocking society as not the life he chooses to live to the end of the film 's dialogue of his wanting to become part of society the viewer can understand his reasons because in between these two dialogues which serve as the viewer witnesses the despair and horrible life that he lives and the comfort is in seeing that he has decided to take an alternate course a life without herion the entire film is great and highly recommended stars
being scottish maybe i 'm biased but this is a brilliant laugh out loud funny film i looked at its reviews on the us amazon site just to see what the americans made of it especially the accents they 're really not that thick '' as many reviewers state i think even viewers from england understood them also trainspotting is intentionally funny our sense of humour is not the same as yours though do n't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible its full of colloquial scots not scotch thats the drink also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film
ewan mcgregor joins another fine ensemble cast it 's always been fashionable to say everything has been before as an buff sometimes i start to believe it then a film like this comes along and kicks me squarely on my ample backside humor that 's dark witty wicked gritty accurate based on a novel by someone with a true appreciation of and a gift for the language no hesitation to smack you hard with the grim reality of heroin addiction you 're groaning i can tell you 're thinking this is such a stale subject that it only proves my opening premise but you 're wrong yet another keeper maybe i 'll stay out of the dvd stores and let my lovely wife keep buying the films i ignored this one for years because the cover 's so ugly i 'm sure the novel was fantastic and i know it must be damn hard to translate such novels to the screen because we 've seen so many failures but with a great screenwriter plus the right production team and actors it can be done it has been done if you spot this consider picking it up but do read the reasons it 's rated it 's not for the kids
this movie is completely sick a total gross out no holds barred film about heroin addiction the way it should be heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction but the movie is sharp fast and funny the cast is great and the soundtrack as well drugstore cowboy with techno
its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly but that did n't stop trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties and having just watched it this morning i can safely state that it holds up well to this day while i have n't read the irvine welsh novel on which this movie is based i have read some of his other work and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling filled with bawdy set pieces characters living on the edge of acceptable society and lots and lots of swears it 's also the kind of violent and pop culture movie complete with soundtrack that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade for my money at least this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting but annoyingly depressing and pedantic requiem for a dream which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise trainspotting is a blunt unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes it does n't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction but it does n't downplay all the fun of it either which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director danny boyle whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the 28 days later perhaps most impressively it manages to contain one of my top ten movie lines who needs reasons when you 've got heroin my favorite nickname ever fictional or otherwise we called him mother superior on account of the length of his habit '' and more oh my god did i just see that '' images than you 'll find in fifty hollywood blockbusters in boyle 's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room the movie 's protagonist climbing into scotland 's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost or the hallucinatory nightmarish haze of a withdrawal the unrestrained depictions of sex nudity violence drug use and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid in one country 's urban culture the action is filtered through the point of view of the movie 's narrator mark renton a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because well all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison although i do n't use drugs well the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway it 's not exactly hard to understand renton 's a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives really that 's what the movie 's relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness renton 's not that bad a guy he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some iggy pop and if his lifestyle causes anyone else his parents to suffer well that 's just an unfortunate byproduct besides it 's not like he 's missing that much the scotland of trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy decay and even the natural beauty of the local highlands is n't enough to overcome the cynicism that 's overtaken renton and most of his friends viewed against this backdrop it 's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it although ewan macgregor plays renton in fashion too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre star wars prequels robert carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing begbie an unhinged psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him intentionally or not even though or perhaps because he 's so violent and unpredictable begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone even though i would n't get within fifty feet of the guy i could n't help but enjoy watching him especially with carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance besides in addition to what i 've written above how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees if that does n't scream fun for the whole family i do n't know what does
the danny boyle directed trainspotting '' was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty '' star robert carlyle as violent psycho begbie swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high congregating in a filthy deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high as a group they 're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix mcgregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories in a humorous scene cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories he then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them mcgregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations escaping to london and working as a realtor his buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life mcgregor and carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true big drug deal they manage to complete the deal for pounds which mcgregor decides to steal he intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew fat chance
like i said simply outrageous in all the best ways the thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times and i am pretty good at understanding accents mark 's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible not just a story but a true slice of life flick
there are few movies which warrant a 5 star rating from me if i could give trainspotting 10 stars i would for me a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll it has to make you think and feel it has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions trainspotting delivers the goods so many have described the movie and what it 's about i am not going to do that suffice it to say that the movie will make you cry laugh think cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it i remember having the nagging feeling that i needed to take a shower after seeing it that my friends is the sign of a great movie another great feature of trainspotting is the soundtrack it features many of my favorites iggy pop lou reed etc the soundtrack is perfect for this movie everytime i hear lust for life by iggy pop now i automatically think of trainspotting that is another sign of a great movie if only it would get a criterion release
i dont need to explain the plot of trainspotting '' as pretty much ever other review has already done that the film is half serious half comical view of an extremely destructive depressing lifestyle i dont know if this won any awards but it really should have because for the most part it doesnt follow any hollywood clich'es peac
we have right brain and left brain my triplets who have very different personalities liked baby einstein better when they were still in bouncers and crawling around now that they are toddlers at 22 mos they 've been enjoying brainy baby better they still like baby einstein but since that only has music they just get the enjoyment of the pictures and music and such and the visual fun with brainy baby they are now learning because the narrator will say what 's on the screen instead of just seeing it so they are learning more now and understanding for us baby einstein is better for the infants where brainy baby is better for the toddlers ages to start but we love it ! i did n't know they made more but now that i know i 'm going to start buying the others ! they love them
i have 2 year old twins they enjoy this dvd as well as learn from it and when i put it on it holds there attention long enough to get in a half hour workout
i purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos i think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time these were the only videos that ever captured his attention at that young age any other video disney baby einstein just had him crying within a few minutes these though he would watch to the end fascinated to this day he loves them and he is now 15 months old the tapes are worn out so i am reordering them both not only does he still love them but i just had a new baby and i am hoping they will entertain her just as much in fact the other night we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and would n't go back to sleep finally in desperation my husband popped one of these into the vcr and my son was instantly quieted the moment he heard the familiar music in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed we have since purchased most of the other titles in the brainy baby series he loves them all the music the images of the babies etc the abc video is especially he also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by baby einstein sesame street etc but these two left right brain videos are still his very favorites
my son who is two just loves these videos he interacts with them more than any other video
this is the review that almost was n't we bought this dvd months ago and our daughter cried within moments of it coming on she was very much a baby einstein kid recently she actually asked for this dvd luckily we had n't given it away yet she 's 25 months and speech delayed she usually sits quietly when a show is on after watching this a couple of times she was repeating sounds and actually tried to recite the alphabet the repetitive nature of the dvd series seems to be the key here we 've since acquired right brain english and abcs all of which she loves and responds to i ca n't wait to get more
before i purchased this dvd i rented it from the library along with baby einstein language dvd my daughter loves the baby brainy and will watch the whole thing the einstein she only watched for about 5 minutes and turned away
two thumbs way up for this addition to the right brain video ! our daughter is either busy trying to find the flash card that goes with what is being shown on the screen or she is twirling to the music either way she is learning and that is the whole reason we bought these in the first place i have found quality for my money and an educational experience with brainy baby that does n't talk down to our kids but inspires them to join in on the learning
i have a 13 month old boy and he has both the right and the left brain video and he loves them ! i can have the tv on any time around him but he only really pays attention to it when i put on one of these videos i tried the baby einstein videos and baby mozart held his interest for a bit but nothing like the brainy baby series i 've noticed that at first he loved the right brain the most but as he gets older he is becoming more and more interested in the left brain video i have also lent them to my friends that have the einstein videos and some of them have gone out to buy the brainy baby series i 'm on my way now to try some more of the serie
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest '' woks the way it does billy nighy gives an performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars '' yes i prefer pirates '' over tlotr although perhaps my comments are premature since at world end '' has n't even been released yet should that be a dud then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates '' on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out
as a teenager i have to say that this movie was was awesome yet still def ca n't wait for it to come out on dvd
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind '' or even lord of the rings '' you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh to gross you out to surprise you with its clever twists of plot to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates ' treasures
i loved this movie i did n't think the plot was patchy at all and i did n't think it was hurried either what i do think is that people forget that the movie company had the third movie already in the makes when the second was in theaters i was taken away with the plot it was so deep and there were so many threads of different and different ties that would explain something later that i was breathless like for one what is with his hat does it too have magical powers his compass ! i loved how that took a whole knew leap ! heck i want to know if the little dangly coin in his hair by his face has a significance everything about jack sparrow has a reason him carrying the gun with one shot you did n't find out why he kept it till the very end kept it to pay back barbossa anyway people should not view this second movie as a no view it as you did the lord of the rings 'll take more than one movie to get the entire plot told what i think is that the script was so long but so good that the company decided not to cut they did n't want to cut out all the originality of the story they decided to just cut the script in half and have it told in two movies i believe all those 'plot holes ' people complain about in this second movie will be answered in movie three that 's what i think anyway i loved it though i do agree that the love triangle with will elizabeth and jack was weird even had me tilting my head in confusion but again there 's probably a reason for that the hat ! hah ! maybe the hat keeps the women away SMILE who knows ! we 'll find out in may aye but like i said do n't view this movie as a see it as the first half of a continuation that it is i loved it and i 'm anxious for the third movie to come out i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good long that have hidden meanings in words and actions and twists in a plot that will shock you and yet excite you at the unexpectedness of it i think everyone 's questions will be answered in movie three 's the whole point to having a 'to be continued ' at the end of the movie right it means there is more to come and there is more that needs to be explained so enjoy this movie and enjoy that feeling of excitement and dissapointment that you have to wait for the third to come out in order to see the conclusion to this plot i loved it i 'm a writer maybe i 'm used to seeing things like this because i do it myself why cut off a story at a point where a reader will be satisfied nooooo you cut it off at a cliff hanger so that they will come looking for answers and to see if the characters will succeed it 's an old trick used since the beginning of time it builds tension and i think ontop of people forgetting it 's a story they did n't want to be left hanging and forced to wait face it we are n't a patient society and we want everything now but our patience will be rewarded in movie three so enjoy movie one with it 's completeness and enjoy movie two as the beginning of the grand adventure because it 's just the beginning everything will be answered soon and the plot will only thicken least in my opinion
my expectations were high for this film they were met but just barley with another jack sparrow produced adventure this film suffers the weight of a confusing script a bad performance from orlando bloom and the sheer amount of volume they attempted to cram '' into this picture the visuals in this film are fantastic the music is and the sound is rich in detail the script however seems to be attempting too many plot lines to keep a precise view on the major storyline i 'm sure they needed to get some necessary material out of the way and developed in time for the third film but it seems to me to be too much ! plot spoilers the characters also suffer in this film jack sparrow and barbossa are the only and well performed characters will and elizabeth seem more like composted studio produced nonsense this film is no exception bloom did not live up to my expectations on character development by any means for example when will finds out his father is alive it is as if it does not surprise him all that much after seeing him successfully command a siege and engage in a love affair with a king 's wife in kingdom of heaven director 's cut i expected so much more from him knightly on the other hand seems to fair a little better with the material her performance in this film was much more dynamic i especially love johnny depp 's conversations with her she seems to be getting a handle on her character by the time we get to the end of the film i feel like i 've been at la fitness all day i feel pumped but i also want to sleep asap overall this is an average film heightened only by its technical achievements and a few good performances recommended but proceed with caution the third film might get a little shaky since it bears the weight of the first two and the high expectations of a good original plot payoff
i did n't notice it was a bad movie all i saw was johnny depp seriously it 's a great movie i think maybe people are forgeting this started out as a childrens ' movie
among soviet movies there are more expensive bondarchuk 's war and peace and more intellectual sokurov tarkovsky but the white sun of the desert remains the best known and the most popular russian film ever made if you ask people especially men who were born and raised in the former soviet union you will be convinced by their enthusiastic response and expression of love for this movie it is rare indeed for a work of art to elicit such a uniform and unconditional admiration and there must be something about this film which deserves such a reaction from several hundred million people there is a lot of myths and legends surrounding the creation of this film one legend which is probably true has it that after the movie was made it was censored and put on the shelf '' never to be seen again then one dark and stormy night there was a call to the state film archives from brezhnev 's dacha suburban mansion they were asking for something new for the big boss '' to watch the clerk on duty scared out of his wits picked up a and sent it with the awaiting car brezhnev who was not senile yet liked the movie and asked why it has not been released the rest is history the timeless appeal of this movie as any other true work of art is that you can watch it time after time never tire of it and find something new and interesting about it every kind of viewer will find something to like about this film excellent direction good actor 's work characters unusual plot line and a lot of action and the best of all it is based on the true events the original intent of the movie was to shoot another action flick about the red army fighting bands in the middle asia after the civil war another legend has it that when one of the old red army soldiers who participated in actual fighting was asked by the and director about the difficulties of the time he thought about it for a while and then said that the most difficult question was what to do with all those women coming from harems of bandits who were either killed or in hiding that created the wonderful story line of the movie the quality of image transfer on this dvd is very good if you watch many foreign language movies you probably know that the best way is to read the subtitles not listen to the dubbed version which is not good anyway if you are interested in cinematography you can not do without watching this film if you just would like to watch an interesting movie get it you wo n't regret
i 'd give 4 stars for this dvd release the movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies to relate the atmosphere of an old 60 's soviet eastern '' is not easy to an american viewer and i believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice besides that it 's a must have particularly for any russian
comming of age in the 80 's is getting made fun of lately but i thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of aids people were dieing so fast and i lost teachers to that it was not like today this movie is really good and in the 1980 's style it is a great comedy if you like the 80 's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying bueller repeated times see this movie you will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie anyway perhaps you just might like the 80 's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music
bueller ferris bueller ok lets start off with what wrong with this edition of ferris bueller 's day off there are two problem i see with this new bueller bueller dvd edition of ferris one is the over use of it all ben stein and the missing director john hughes 's missing audio commentary now the good news there are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie and then there is the movie extras are fine however the film is a minor classic matthew broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye broderick 's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience he is part robert preston from the music robert wagner from it takes a thief broderick playing ferris is slick sly and a con man with style he pokes a stick of his collective eye of principal jeffrey deadwood jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment the supportive cast of alan spin city ruck and mia sara makes a sorta lover 's triangle without love nor deeper friendship the two combined with broderick makes this film a buddy movie rather than a teen angst film like not another teen movies or ten things i hate about you so want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked get this film and as ferris would say what are you still doing here why are n't you buying this yet '' bennet pomerantz audioworl
ferris bueller matthew broderick is a kind of hero to every aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye alan ruck a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick '' day for him his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his sister jeannie jennifer grey who suspects something is up as does the dean of students ed rooney jeffrey jones it 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days it 's amazing people like his parents who are most easily duped would think that this one sick kid when in reality he 's having a ball however knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile ferris and cameron bail out ferris ' girl sloane mia sara with a dead grandmother ploy and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the gt convertible oh yeah ! this movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time it 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life for after all as our hero says life moves pretty fast if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while you might miss it '' that 's the moral of the story really bueller bueller bueller '' not here but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day
perfect movie for everyone no matter how many times i watch the movie it is always funny whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good
matthew broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school what happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy broderick stars as ferris bueller a somewhat clever and deceitful in a funny way high school senior who along with his best friend cameron alan ruck decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown chicago in springtime ferris convinces cameron to take his father 's prized red ferrari out for the day reluctantly cameron agrees and soon the two are off on their adventure their next plan is to get ferris ' girlfriend sloane mia sara out of school so she can go along ferris and cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell dean of students ed rooney jeffery jones that sloane 's grandmother passed away dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat ferris arrives at the school to pick up sloane and the three drive happily away however rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that ferris is at the root of it he sets off to find ferris himself and bring him back to school by the end of the movie rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office meanwhile ferris ' sister jeannie jennifer grey has figured out what ferris is really doing angry that ferris seems to get away with everything she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor sick ferris while she really knows what is going on in the end though she proves to be a big help to him after heading downtown the trio take the ferrari to a local parking garage cameron 's father knows the exact mileage of the car so cameron is already nervous about allowing ferris to drive it but that 's just the beginning the garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer during their day ferris cameron and sloane manage to see the sears tower a cubs game visit the art institute and see ferris sing twist and shout '' from a parade float but when they head back to the garage to get the car ferris finds out about the extra mileage and cameron goes crazy ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse however the miles do n't come off cameron having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents takes out his aggression on the car soon it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him but ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do will he make it in time this movie has attained a sort of cult '' status over the years and still remains as funny as ever matthew broderick is perfect as the scheming ferris while jeffery jones does a very good job as rooney jennifer grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly and alan ruck 's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless ferris let 's not forget the funny cameo by ben stein as the teacher who coined the term anyone anyone bueller '' i recommend this extremely funny movie very highly the acting is great and the story is very funny as a cubs fan i was glad to see the scenes in wrigley field and hear harry caray 's voice watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day
one of john hughes best films ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were love this film
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! ! rock o
my brother is cameron fry and it was n't until his first year in college that he found his ferris bueller this is a classic that every high school student should see it 's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best it 's easy to tell from this film that matthew broderick was destined to be a star
a movie with one good line after another funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players just a great funny movi
haven t seen this movie for years but it s still the cult classic i remember with great performances from all still one of my all time favourite films
this film hit a nerve with anyone in highschool during the 80 's and the commentary on popularity still holds true today the number of cliques in my school was staggering and i meandered from group to group never dropping anchor i stayed sane while watching everyone else fall apart lol i knew quite a few heathers '' all the same basically school being not so much academic as social most of the adult figures in the film are mindless twits oblivious to the needs of youth this is still one of my top ten favorite movies
i remember watching this movie a few years back i thought it was decent overall but my biggest question is if jason hated the world so much why did n't he blow himself up inside the gym
i just killed my best friend '' and your worst enemy '' excellent dark i love this movie religiously
the totally rocked with laid back teenagers who were a little wild a little care free who does n't love that especially when it 's in a movie like heathers '' this black comedy is totally wild in a very great way it 's unlike any other movie i 've seen everything about it is very special the language the situations the attitudes and actions of the cool but bizarre characters veronica ryder is a really great girl but she is best friends '' with the heathers the 3 most popular girls in school all named heather veronica hates her friends they are complete snobs she even wishes heather 1 would die veronica meets the wild and crazy jd and she falls for him with two extraordinary characters like these there 's bound to be trouble one accidental well sort of accidental death leads to a series of other deaths all poking fun at the serious issue teen suicide fall in love with the crazy veronica and jd as veronica tries to stop their crazy ways laugh your butt off at the lines used in this cutting edge film believe me you have never heard or seen anything like it you may even pick up a couple of crazy lines you hear in this movie i know i sure do have fun watching these crazy and bizarre scenes that will make you laugh and say wow '' at the same time heathers '' is a movie that is ahead of it 's time teenagers can relate to the characters it pokes fun at serious but it is 100 hilarious loosen up and watch heathers ''
black comedy at it 's best this film is so brilliant in the way it does n't sit there and glorify suicide it just makes fun of what all other movies were doing and the way the media was making it the top story really no matter what i like that idea sometimes i write a review just to make fun of somebody elses you haev to have that type a sense of humor to really like this film when christian slater shows up for his first scene of the movie doing his jack nicholson impression voth in vioce and in character and pulls out a gun to shoot the second and third person that he conversates with was a pretty surreal moment of course we find out that the gun was empty and your heart may slow down a tad so we continue and find out who these heathers are you will figure it out pretty quick it is just like any other teen movie but manages to give that extra sense of style for the time and the director does a great job of showing the girls seeming 30 years old when they are really like 16 but then acting their age around any older person that they have to interact with like college students do n't expect anything real but more what of these types of people would have been like back in high school if they could achieve that kind of power or sadly enough what probably happened in many schools but the acting direction and overall cheesy type of fun just ends up xploding into a great movie the music will certainly help you through a lot of weird scenes picture quality is aesome the commentary is really good with explaing literally everything that happens all that you want to know will be answered for sure the documentary does a wonderful job of explaining how the movie was put together making of and a great job explaining what exactly it is about also you realize all the greatly talented people who worked with other major amd things all on their own also the cast gives you more than your fill of info and if you can make it through the 100 paegs of notes to read the real ending it is very trippy and gives you some insight of how they original wrote it not just a black comedy but one of the most twisted films ever but funny the writer is certainly what is the word well i will go with prolific he can write for probaably 48 hours straight or so i would imagine so easily a for the dvd realease and a great movie
a film about teens plagued with mean spiritedness and revenge on their minds ends up being one of the best films of the 80 's one of the most darkest comedies with envious contempt evil at its core yet deliciously irrisistable the whole cast is sensational especially ryder who still says in interviews today this is personally her favorite film she has done in her career
i know i did sometimes the pressure of stupid jocks and stupid plastics cant drive you up the wall ! this movie is a great representation about the adventures of high school and trying to fit in it sends a great message to just forget the crowd and do your own thing
hi i just wanted to say that for those saying that the complete '' series are composed of 26 episodes they 're wrong the full series are 30 episodes with a not that bad ending
awesome anime you would be hard pressed to find one that 's better this one was actually suggested to me by a friend and after i watched the first 3 episodes i was hooked i have watched the entire series now the story is very well developed and mainly follows 4 wolves on their journey to find paradise which is supposed to be opened by the wolves with the help of the flower maiden kiba tsume hige and toboe are the four travelers and for the most part take a human form to fool the humans because wolves are supposed to be extinct each character has his or her own distinct personality toboe is the youngest of the group and tends to be more scared and child like but he is also driven to prove himself he grows so much over the course of the show tsume is dangerous and wild and even though he pretends to be cold he really likes being part of his new pack hige is pretty go with the flow for most of the series and kiba is very determined verging on one track minded and seems to sense things the others ca n't if you 're not into crying i would n't suggest this anime because trust me you will be crying by the end i think i spent the last 4 or 5 episodes sobbing but it 's a great story and these are great characters if you buy this anime you wo n't be disappointed i loved it from beginning to end !
there is a subgenre of anime very possibly inspired by the horrors of japan 's nuclear bombing that deals with the end and rebirth of the world wolf 's rain joins neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon in the trilogy of the subgenre 's best known works and is by far the most accessible of the three in the vague future or perhaps an alternate universe wolves have mastered the ability to create illusions allowing them to survive among humankind and a legend tells that when wolves join a flower maiden paradise will be opened and the apocalypse will begin as scientists create a flower maiden named cheza four solitary wolves join to form a pack kiba the soul of the pack has a sixth sense driving him towards cheza and attuning him to her tsume the mind of the pack is calm and rational offering a needed counterbalance to kiba 's dreaming hige the body of the pack is canny and streetsmart the best at navigating the practicalities necessary to survive toboe the heart of the pack is kindness compassion and innocence personified and the pack 's link to humanity as he had until recently been domesticated also entangled in their story are quent a wolf hunter driven by grief who wrongly blames them for the murder of his wife and son and wo n't rest until they 're dead cher a scientist and cheza expert and cher 's ex hubb a good man and wonderful husband whose marriage to her was unfortunately a casualty of her obsession with cheza as the wolves join with cheza and seek paradise they must deal with the human population terrified of them the military tracking cheza down quent 's determination the forces of nature even darker enemies they are not yet aware of and perhaps most of all their own hopes and fears about paradise and what it will mean if and when they reach it this is a beautiful epic story with some of anime 's most gorgeous artwork and characters you will very quickly come to love the whole series and soundtrack are included and i 'll note here that the fourth dvd can safely be skipped as it consists of a series of flashback episodes necessitated by a halt in production during the sars epidemic i 'll also note that this one is not for kids as it becomes quite violent and very dark if you want a deep mature anime with an ending that will stay etched in your mind this is for you
to begin with the story evolves in a future time or something like a parallel '' dimension which has a lot in common with earth it evolves around four friends kiba hige tsume and tolboy who are actually wolfs but are able to transform into humans and a young girl cheza which is basically the so called lunar flower as for the story for an anime it is honestly complicated and therefore i will try to describe it as simple as possible without giving so much away the world is in a very bad shape war brakes out and in the middle are these five friends who try to find their way to paradise and with the help of cheza to unlock it to all this comes a guy named quent who tries to kill every wolf alive and the reason is that wolfs are supposed to have killed his family something that proofs later on to be a crime that has been accomplished '' by someone else quent has also for his hunt a half female wolf to make things more complicated there is a female scientist cher who is so fascinated with the entire situation that would do everything to follow their steps what basically turned her into a fanatic '' about all this is that she holds a book named the book of the moon '' which basically explains more or less what is going on her detective hubb labowski will risk everything in order to make her love him again and win her back to all this comes a noble man darcia who is actually a wolf as well but his wife got a disease and the only way to help her is through cheza well if i am not mistaken these are the main protagonists as for the story the protagonists have to go through various difficulties during a period of war furthermore earth '' is falling apart and they are running out of time moreover as another reviewer has already stated it is that the series are very emotional especially towards the end where lets say people who you started to like will die the character development is very good and relations will evolve but have nothing to do with nudity in the end all pieces come together with the exception of the last minute which gives you a finish in the idea of evangelion the animation with a few exceptions is very good and the music superb to sum up the shows are seriously very good therefore if you can afford the money you should definitely buy it and surely will not be disappointed
this is my absolute favorite anime series i have ever seen this is the series that got me interested in anime and started my slight obsession '' i own all the singles of the dvds and still plan to buy this set the sereies it 's self is so well done it 's very well planned with the main story and then two or three side stories that are still wonderful to see this is not a light hearted story it has a dark shadow over it most of the time but it just hightens the intensity the story circles around four wolves hige toboe tsume and the kinda leader '' of them the one that starts the hunt for paradise kiba they are all looking for a way to the fabled paradise and to open it for the wolves while a noble named darcia wants to open it for the nobles they are all frantically trying to get their hands on the flower maiden named cheza who is the key to opening paradise the story follows them as they cross the dying earth to open the doors to a better tomorrow they have very strong unique personalities that make you fall in love with each of them by the end there are several other characters that pop up often and they have their own troubles and stories and help break some of the tension of the story along the way as well the voices for all the characters are wonderful including the voice of spike spiegel from cowboy bebop as darcia and only bring the stories more to life the graphics are very like cowboy bebop and the slight fade to the colors really works for the story and who can ever complain about music done by the great yoko kanno i wanted to cry when i heard the end song the first time because they 're just so moving i have both the soundtracks and i love every one of the tracks this has definetely become one of the classics and i would highly recommend this series to everyone
i 'll start this by saying that wolf 's rain is one of those anime that people are going to talk about for a long time kind of like trigun and cowboy bebop the story is as magical as any i 've seen the characters though stereotypical at first turn into some truly lovable specimens and the setting and the atmosphere is convincing if a bit after that the music accompanies this series excellently the animation quality is so startlingly good that it 's hard to believe that this is a thirty episode series the budget must have been huge and the both english and japanese is superb since this is the review for the box set i wo n't say much on the story other than that it is filled with some imagination and very few stereotypes it follows a group of wolves all unique in character as well as some of their human compatriots and enemies as they search for paradise which can only be found by wolves along the way they battle nobles a hunter and face some tragic losses and they even face four episodes of repetition in '' episodes but this had something to do with the sars scare in asia which made it impossible for the animators of wolf 's rain to do any real work other than recap episodes now i 'd like to talk about the box it seems american anime studios are beginning to understand that the fans love their soundtracks box sets and art boxes are coming with soundtracks more and more often and wolf 's rain is no different other than the fact that the music is wolf 's rain was excellent this set also includes all seven of the dvds with all the original artwork and features packed into this awkwardly shaped though still beautiful set a little pricey maybe and certainly not cutting edge since irresponsible captain tylor has a out much like this wolf 's rain is one of those anime that is worth the high price especially when you consider the content and the actual worth so if you were a fan of wolf 's rain when it ran on tv then now is a the best time to get this set before it is gone
edge of seventeen is a very enjoyable movie i found myself rewatching it over and over again theres nothing to spectacular about it its just a typical coming out and coming to terms movie i just found that the main character is very sweet and charming in a innocent way the plot was very foward and basic with a few little tid bits to living it up the film was made in the and is a bit dated but if you just want to see a decent film concerning the gay lifestyle or coming out this definatly buy this film you wont be dissapointed
this is one of the most well written and performed movies about coming out i 've seen up to this very has the same sincere and heartwarming candor of its hetero counterpart sixteen candles though the story takes place in the late eighties its themes are timeles and universal for any queer youth and enlightened hetero 's as
movie dvd quality dvd extras dramas about gays coming out of the closet ! are so plentiful they sometimes run together in my mind edge of seventeen '' is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way the screenplay by todd stephens is sensitive and true to life or rather many people 's lives it tells the story of eric chris stafford a young man growing up in the small town of sandusky ohio who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation what is so refreshing about the script is that eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero he 's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless other times sweet and naive occasionally manipulative but generally a good guy in other words completely human that holds true of the other characters in the movie including eric 's parents who love him dearly but are n't quite sure what to make of his moods and appearance his female best friend tina holmes who harbors deeper feelings for him and his new gay family '' headed by lea delaria who are fiercely supportive yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process thankfully stephens ' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and does n't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package at the end of the movie there 's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live learn make mistakes and thrive sequel anyone the entire cast is uniformly outstanding chris stafford embodies eric in all his complexity his performance never strikes a false note tina holmes is amazing as his confused female friend more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young meryl streep a high compliment indeed stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself as eric 's baffled mother and andersen gabrych is fine as eric 's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart perhaps best of all is comic lea delaria who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the earth mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to eric regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away the strand dvd offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video the somewhat sparse extras are limited to the theatrical trailers for edge of seventeen '' and five other feature films designed to appeal to lgbt audiences it would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers but this is a small complaint overall this is truly a film one that is worthy of repeat viewings
this is a great movie about a teenage boy coming to terms with his sexuality it is by turns moving and as the boy makes his way through adolescence a difficult time for any teen this period in a boy 's life is further complicated by his conflicted sexuality this will bring back strong memories good and bad for any gay man who has lived this story chris stafford shines in the lead role aided by sensitive performance by the entire cast great use of costumes and as the boy changes over time do n't miss this one !
this is one of the best gay films that i have seen it is touching without being sappy and realistic without going overboard in many ways the story parallels my own life growing up gay in the midwest during the eighties the main character is so sweet and innocent it just makes you want to root for him and you ca n't help but feel his angst as he struggles to discover and accept himself beautifully done and extremely well acted bravo !
i lived this and felt like my diary was being read outloud to everyone i knew and did n't know my god what an excellent way to show the true pain of confussion love lust and terror all rolled into one young gay man wow i could not believe how this movie made me feel from start to finish i hope that young gay boys and even girls find strength in this film

when i first saw this film some five years ago it truly knocked the breath out of me for the first time director allison anders gives us a glimpse into gang life in east la 's echo park from the female perspective this time in the past we have seen our share of male experiences example being zoot suit written by the playwright luis valdez for once we see the gritty side of the gang life as young mexicanas or chicanas depending on who you ask struggle to stay alive amidst rampant drug dealing the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them mi vida loca is actually a trilogy of stories mousie sad girl lowrider and la blue eyes the first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members mousie seidy lopez and sad girl angel aviles these young women are best friends until the day that sad girl sleeps with mousie 's boyfriend ernesto jacob vargas and becomes pregnant with his child the world they knew before is ruptured as is their lifelong connection as friends the second story takes a glimpse in lowrider culture this culture is perpetuated by predominantly young chicanos who build their lives around and airbrushing low rider '' cars many old school chevies complete with flashy airbrush images example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations trick tires and rims this story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism when the car takes on a life of its own the third story is centered around la blue eyes a beautiful woman who is writing to a convict that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters the question is when they finally meet will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter or has the young woman ultimately been deceived the whole time i reccomend this film if not for the fact that it is compelling but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about a very important study in gang life and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news but never get to know
i love this movie ! ! ! it is the best movie ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it has so many things that poor hispanics and go through its kind of sterotypical but it is still a good movie ! ! ! yeah it is kinda of rough but it shows so much reality it has sooooooo much drama and things just happen so randomly i love this movie i would watch it every day if i could ! !
i love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways thats where i got my nickname giggles can really relate to sad girl friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching all relate to it like mousie sadgirl whisper sleepy ernesto enjoy one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life
this movie reminds me of back in the dayz growing up in kali i enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up for other people that do n't quite get chicana life this movie will help you understand even though now in dayz it 's not that harsh growing up in city like the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets a must see movie overall ! ! ! chicana love la travies
this is a real good movie better than american me in my opinion when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy tha story goes on about other events tha only thing i didnt like about it was that i thought it ended too early other than that this is a real good
i was amased at how very well acted directed and written this movie was the dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips everyone was well cast it is great movie for anyone and transcends the cliche it transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it 's a gay '' movie if you hated go fish '' like i did you 'll love this movie and go whew '' for this film it saves our lesbian cinema souls ! buy it ! you wo n't be sorr
i really enjoyed the way the director incorporated the play which the movie was based on into the movie the acting was great and the love story was touching i loved to see a real life lesbian couple playing the roles based on a real life account of their own story dom deluise and mink stole were hilarious and i highly recommend this movie
i enjoyed this movie quite a lot the layered reality writers playing writers playing actors playing themselves keeps you on your toes the cinematic device of organic storytelling is enhanced by cutaways in both time and space to scenes of what we are to assume is each character 's present reality outside the theater at the time when the story takes place back to the image of the storytellers in a narrative about these events that have already taken place and again out to their experience coming to knowone another under dom deluise 's direction in the same theater in the past really it 's an interesting device production values are high and this film is pretty funny sexy revealing while i would n't necessarily call it cinematic genius gay movies dealing with any kind of plot beyond coming out are few and far between this film is very much about they fall apart and how they are born the fact that these are lesbian relationships is just the cherry
the first time i saw this flick i did not like it it was so unusual in how it was done yes i have been to numerous plays on broadway but that is where i expect to see them then i watched the making of it and learned about how it was based on truth and for whatever reason i watched it again and came to appreciated it from it a different light why i could not do that the first time i do n't know this may sound strange but overall i really enjoyed it and highly recommend that if you do n't like it the first time at least watch the making of it i ended up buying the movie
when i first viewed jurassic park '' in a theatre on wilshire blvd in los angeles i actually walked out it was n't so much because of the film but the speaker system in the theatre were so darn loud i thought i was back on an air force flightline i actually had to cover my ears it was so irritating and i was not alone many others got up to leave too this film has been discussed to the point that i do n't believe there is anything further i can add however i am not a big dinosaur film type person i really like archaelogy and paleantology however as one who is not a specialist but through an interest in the past however when i viewed the film again on dvd i found the film pretty darn interesting and a very fun watch it was exciting and the dinosaurs were done very well and more importantly what i liked about the film is how the scientific community at lest one rich man in particular who is funding them shows their disrespect and arrogance for nature and the natural selection by interfering with what is best left alone this was delved into in a very enlightening and interesting way in the film i highly recommend the film if you have young or teenagers as i do they will enjoy the film it is action packed and a very suspenseful film especially the dinosaur scenes recommended
jurassic park is one of the best if not the best movies made about dinosaurs ever it 's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released it 's also one of the first movies to use cgi in significant scenes throughout the film it 's also the movie that gave sam neill a break and reinvigorated the career of jeff goldblum the movie promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier got the general public and not just kids excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what raiders of the lost ark did to archaeology the premise seeped in pop science is that a john hammond richard attenborough brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber he builds a zoological he calls jurassic park however in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park 's workers hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable thus alan grant sam neill ellie sattler laura dern and ian malcolm jeff goldblum arrive to tour the facilities hammond 's grandchildren lex ariana richards and tim murphy joseph mazzello are also along for the ride as test subjects due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose jurassic park set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it is n't difficult to see why the cgi effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then yet the creatures appear completely lifelike of course spielberg not only used cgi but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well it was a massive undertaking but one that had a huge payoff there 's not much to complain about with jurassic park sam neill is great as grant the role was originally offered to harrison ford and i 'm actually glad he turned it down and jeff goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen after 15 years of directing his own movies richard attenborough came back for the perfect part as john hammond the action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres the movie is classic spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made this dvd includes a very informative documentary about the making of jurassic park some clips from an early production meeting it 's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real spielberg some storyboards and other illustrations phil tippett 's animatic of the raptors in the kitchen '' sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having tongues trailers for all three jurassic park movies a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie some production notes and a list and partial filmography of the cast crew
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way '' in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random '' unpredictable events result from the normal '' because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive '' in a environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict behavior of his animals love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated though i found hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex i prefer to be called a hacker '' uses silicon graphics ' file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice
this movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great the action scenes are particularly terrifying particularly when the breaks through the fence also when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen too bad i was rooting for the raptors but still these scenes in particular were very very real very scary and ! it 's equally interesting to judge what did n't work in this movie the characters not quite as weak as those in the book but close many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake and of course the bulk of the book 's great science got lost but still none of this really matters that much the scary scenes were awfully scary ! those dinosaurs looked real ! i can watch those scenes over and over and over again so owning a quality dvd like this makes it easy ! if you do n't have it already give it a shot !
'jurassic park ' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'best picture ' nod at the oscars now some of you may not agree and then some of you may i feel that 'jurassic park ' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen adapted loosly from michael crichton 's novel of the same name 'jurassic park ' delivers a solid script solid acting and solid thrills that can not and will not be repeated as is proven by the failed attempts in 'the lost world ' and 'jurassic park iii ' both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original before the doors to the amusement park to end all amusement parks is opened the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look amoung these experts is a mathematician goldbloom and dern and neill of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit or i should say a lot skeptical but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned the film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive one of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise this is the film to beat
this movie is the bomb ! i had such a great time with this movie ! jurassic park has always been great ! the videogames where great ! and i loved the soundtrack ! if you have seeen my other reviews you will know i love a movie with a great soundtrack and this one got it ! hey who dosent like dino action over to your left there are man eating dinos they are gon na shread you ! so much action ! this movie couldent get any better ! well if they somehow got lost in the city it would be the bomb ! but hey this movie is great ! i had a great time and you will too
i 'm trying to decide which of the three i love the best but all should be part of one 's home library i often view them while i 'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster ! it 's easy to forget you 're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the jurassic park movie collection chrissy mcvay autho
i think it 's pretty obvious that fox is a shill for right wing political views but i suppose there are people out there who are fooled and think it 's actually a legitimate news source this film was interesting as it really shows all the subtle little tricks fox uses as well as some of the blatent ones and behind the scenes from if youare already on to fox 's rubbish you wo n't be shocked but i must admit it is interesting to see how their tactics affect other news sources
i 'll admit that i 've never been a fan of fox news the few times i 've watched it i 've been annoyed by its glossy glitzy sensationalist approach to the news well so much for that i prefer to get my news via the internet but the documentary outfoxed from director robert greenwald argues that fox news is more than just a tacky news programme according to the filmmaker the fox channel owned by media mogul rupert murdoch pipes propaganda into millions of homes throughout the world the documentary includes many interviews from former fox television employees some left some were sacked and some were eased out but they all have the same story participate in the party line or you 're out internal fox memos are shown detailing how presenters are prompted to play up certain events and kill other stories various media watchdogs also appear including peter hart from fairness and accuracy on reporting fair and these interviewees analyze the techniques fox applies to its programming and these techniques range from dirty smear campaigns nasty hate mongering and intimidation bill o'reilly to downright tricky one of the best portions of the film shows o'reilly 'interviewing ' jeremy glick the son of a man killed on when glick dares to voice an opinion o'reilly rudely shouts down his guest and then subsequent footage show how the guest 's comments were horribly distorted over an period according to the film fox news has its share in the responsibility of the fear mongering that took place in the to the war as part of a concerted strategy of tension fox hyped fears after watching some of the footage i was surprised the news presenters did n't sink to wearing gas masks while on air in one segment a former cia agent a guest on fox tells host hannity that he 's concerned that america may have problems with wars on two fronts iraq and afghanistan hannity makes an inane comment and compares this situation to walking and chewing gum at the same time it 's obvious that the guest 's comments are being managed cut in a way to limit his point but when one considers the responsibility fox should have to offer accurate and fair news reporting it makes me wonder how some people responsible for this nonsense can sleep at night in one sequence there 's a news snippet stating that it 's safer for soldiers on the streets of iraq than it is living in california i would have laughed out loud at this rubbish if it were n't so disgusting news no one in california has been blown up by ieds but what 's particularly upsetting is that millions of people who watch this stuff do n't seem to realize that fox has eliminated journalism '' and has instead become a mouthpiece for propaganda according to one interviewee fox audiences tend to have comparatively incorrect assumptions '' about some of the myths of the iraq war when compared to audiences on the down side fox television aficionados probably wo n't get much out of this documentary whereas those of us who chose to not watch fox will be appalled but perhaps watching this documentary will help some of us channel people understand where some of the brainwashing comes from when our neighbours and workmates begin to spout their propaganda displacedhuma
this is a must for every person that watches tv news to get general knowledge i have suspected it before i bought this dvd but now it has been backed up by some credible evidence watch this dvd with an open mind
fox news promotes itself as fair and balanced when what it is biased and unbalanced this dvd provides mountains of evidence in the form of video segments that contradict official statements that the network is unbiased and even handed particularly galling is the jeremy glick segment presented in its entirety here o'reilly puts words in glick 's mouth and later segments is seen claiming that his own lies about glick are glick 's actual sentiments this is reprehensible it 's an unflinching depiction of the republican party 's mouthpiece
leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in the man who was n't there '' typically they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember heisenberg 's name nebbish barber ed crane billy bob thornton makes the only decisive and dishonest action of his life and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several mostly bystanders in the man who was n't there '' the phrase decisive action '' is an oxymoron everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance everything that happens from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face changes everything forever and always for the worse set in 1949 in santa rosa a tip of the hat to hitchcock and shadow of a doubt '' perhaps the man who was n't there '' looks perfect like every other coen film it 's a marvel of production design and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty look of such classic noirs as double indemnity '' and out of the past '' thematically however the man who was n't there '' resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant much better acted remake of edgar ulmer 's detour '' in which the characters drift in a sartrean hell totally the victims of fate but whereas detour '' is more than the sum of its parts the man who was n't there '' is less the coen brothers may believe in chance but on the screen they leave nothing to chance so that everything in the man who was n't there '' is too perfect in the end the film has the same overstudied clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except fargo '' it must be admitted though that only one coen film '' the hudsucker proxy '' is ruined by that quality the acting is as superb as in any coen film thornton in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense hangdog gravity there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton 's philandering wife doris james gandolfini as her paramour and boss jon polito as a shady businessman michael badalucco as thornton 's motormouth scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies and especially tony shalhoub nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider defense attorney extraordinaire
this is an excellent film billy bob is a barber who keeps to himself his wife married him because she liked that he did n't talk very much it is a tragedy of epic proportions with great performances from all involved the only thing for me that holds this back from being a five star film is the fact that in every single scene someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one that alone justifies this film 's r '' rating when watching this film it seems that they are encouraging people to be cool '' and that smoking is a pleasurable thing the most notorious moment for me is when frances mcdormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband billy bob to shave her legs he walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag this is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy ! but then that is just my opinion overall the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout the plot is slow yet intensely emotional if you do n't mind smoking then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy if you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this you should review the film before letting them see it
i really enjoyed this film basically the coen homage to the film noir genre i always thought the name was funny since it 's french and yet most of famous directors were german like fritz lang otto preminger etc SMILE the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool unhurried nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey thornton is great in the lead as the reticent phlegmatic barber and if anything he is even more convincing with hair than without even his hairpiece is SMILE the whole cast does a fine job in their roles and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of scenes i found the film 's climax a complete surprise as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber for whom everything seems to be working out up till then overall a great film and probably one of the coen best if you 're a coen fan you wo n't find this one a disappointment
other reviewers consider this move the coen brothers ' best before viewing this film i had seen only miller 's cossing '' and fargo '' i still prefer fargo but acknowledge that this movie is a special kind of masterpiece with few exceptions i usually do not like films based on unsympathetic characters one reason i prefer fargo '' however this film 's exclusive assortment of unlikeable and unprincipled chaqracters creates the perfect springboard for the unintended chain of violent consequences resulting from a opportunistic premeditated act of revenge by a bizzarely laconic barber all of which are meant to illustrate heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise i did n't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of ufos in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line the behavior of the teenage girl at the end of the story was too abrupt and in general i felt that the significance of her character should have been better developed
while the score plays ed crane billy bob thornton intones yeah i worked in a barber shop but i never considered myself a barber '' a perfect opening line for one of the coens ' greatest movies ed has resigned himself to cutting hair and living with his distant wife doris frances mcdormand who is having an affair with her boss big dave james gandolfini when an opportunity opens up involving dry cleaning ed decides to try to control over his destiny and ends up being punished for this in the finest film noir tradition as usual from the coens this is a darkly comic cleverly plotted noir but the unusual for the coens aside from the narration and the gorgeous black and white cinematography is the depth of feeling in this movie although a cipher to everyone around him ed is to the viewer a decent guy who simply does n't belong in his life it 's impossible not to feel empathy for this guy this entire movie bears his essence from the methodical deliberate plotting to the smoky restrained black and white the coens have really thought this one through and the result is marvelous clearly not for everyone but thornton 's depiction of disaffected alienation is brilliant and not to be missed for fans of the coen brother
this may be the best cohn brothers ' movie yet stellar performances by all and a plot that contains no loose ends adds up to a great nouveau flick that shows what could happen when an unsuspecting man starts to travel down the wrong road the ending is almost transcendant this is the kind of movie albert camus might have made if her were a film writer and director
i think you have to see this movie a second time to fully appreciate it there is alot of subtlties that i did n't pick up on until i watched it again years later all the acting was fantastic a standout performance for the actor who played the salesman '' at the hotel ! ! ! the movie ends up being completely freaky and surreal and ya got to have a warped mind to fully grasp the surrealness of the coen brothers
this review is for the 2002 universal dvd the story is set in the late 1940 's where a small town barber named ed crane billy bob thorton concocts a slick blackmail scheme targeting his cheating wife doris frances mcdormand and her boss 'big dave ' brewster james gandolfini after the payoff big dave figures out that ed set him up and a violent fight ensues where one of them is murdered the cops arrest of the wrong person and a big city lawyer named freddy riedenschneider tony schalhoub is hired to defend the accused this sets up the rest of the film for plenty of unexpected twists and turns along with a lot of subtle comedy the coen brothers now have a long resum of wonderful films and this by far my personal favorite since there are many things that work brilliantly in this movie first the black and white cinematography strikingly captures the mood and feel of a late 1940 's film second the deadpan narration and stoic body language by billy bob thorton is mesmerizing third the attention to detail of the props decorating and fashion styles is done to perfection fourth the plot is slick and original finally the comedy is as dark as the dead of night but works magically in this bizarre and macabre atmosphere i enthusiastically recommend this film especially if you enjoy old flicks the dvd widescreen black white presentation is superb as it should be since the movie was shot in 2001. there are many bonus features including commentary by the director joel coen and actor billy bob thorton movie dvd quality a
the man who was n't there is a movie by the always unpredictable coen brothers their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it 's fun to see what they 've come up with next out of the ones i 've seen my thoughts are mixed i mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like raising arizona then one of the best movies of all time with fargo and then go terribly wrong from there then you 've got the big lebowski a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness not what i call a good movie then there 's the ladykillers a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything so they 're just getting worse by age right wait ! let 's go back two years to 2001. it was in this year that this unheard of movie was made of course its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle and that 's the beauty of this gem the cinematography the look of this world and the feel it 's good is brilliant but it 's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own it is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others but first let 's talk about the plot of the movie ed crane billy bob thorton is living in california in the with his wife doris frances mcdormand doris is part of a community that talks and talks but not ed ed narrates this story his story he sees it in black and white or maybe that 's the way it really is you 've got to think ed is a barber and is proud of his job he only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration so here there is some more originality brilliance and beauty when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss big dave james gandolfini he reacts with harshness he blackmails big dave but something goes wrong big dave finds out and ed kills him out of defense and this all happens in the first 30 minutes doris is accused of doing it and from then on you 're in for a real treat when ed is n't narrating like i already said he is n't talking so what he does is smoke cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed birdy scarlett johansson play piano her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty tony shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer freddy riedenschneider he 's a big shot who talks and talks keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the you do n't know '' repeated a bunch of times believe me you 'll know when you 're hearing it the movie is a sad and tragic tale a tale showing how badly one man 's life can go in a world that is n't for him he 's different it 's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one he stands out because he 's different the man who was n't there is hands down an excellent movie it is a close second to fargo in the coen 's movies my last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves this movie is rated r for a scene of violence is that a joke that scene was in black and white and showed nothing ! you people really have no idea what you 're doing pulp fiction r man who was n't there r get it straight people your ratings are horrid james bond flicks have worse content than this
when is coming out the next sesson i ca n't wait ! ! ! it is with out a doubt one of the best miniseries i have seen in a long time
this television series is one of the best running the resurrection of battlestar galactica by the work of the cast and crew of bsg make it the best series on television and on dvd the way the scripts run and the action it makes the viewers chomping at the bit '' for the next episode 2.5 is great the expanded pegasus episodes are worth the purchase alone the action in the episiodes and the quality of the dvd 's are second to none
another great dvd set for television 's best tv drama ! a just for the extended version of 'pegasus ' where you are able to get a little more about admiral kane and the entire pegasus crew musty buy for a drama ! !
you hear it about a lot of shows but battlestar galactica really is the best show on television currently and has taken the science fiction genre truly to a brave new world great acting great writing i wish they 'd just released season 2 in one dvd set instead of dividing it up a money making ploy i guess oh well if it helps pay for more episodes then i wo n't complain too loudly
galactica is for sure one of the best series from all times in this second half of the second season we have the extended version of the fantastic episode pegasus '' plus ressurection ship '' parts 1 and 2 and the captains hand '' were we can see the battlestar pegasus showing all his guns it worths every penny
this show keeps getting better and better all i can say is that anyone and everyone should watch this show
there are many great reveiws ditto to the accolades and step by step commentaries in gestalt the series is aging like fine balsamic vinegar multiple layers of concentrated and pungent aromas creating an essense that both satisfies and leaves a desire for more a heady draught that leaves intermingling aftertastes both strong and pungent yet filled with intricate subtleties highly recommended for mature audiences not afraid to examine the viscerality of a dwindling humanity plunged raw and vulnerably into a hostile environment with primal emotions dissecting credible survivors of near utter global and galactic holocaust do we really deserve to survive and they have a plan recommended highly for all adults of all no interest required
disclaimer i love this show so my opinion may be biased this dvd does not disappoint the first season dvd was great the second season first half was better but this one jumps '' ahead of the rest it contains two episodes epiphanies '' and downloaded '' that were rated by tv guide as the show of the week this season has the most hardcore episodes such as ressurection ship and the finale is the most shocking yet what else can be said thank the gods for bsg
battlestar galactica is definitely ascribing to the idea of quality over quantity this half season starts off with an intense cliffhanger and ends with one just as intense i love shows that can keep the suspense high through the series with no fluff i definitely recommend if you are a fan of science fiction in the vein of babylon 5 firefly or farscape
after his singing career began to wane frank sinatra began his meteoric rise in the movies one of his best comedic roles was in the musical guys and dolls but here 's another gem a frank sinatra sleeper that many viewers have caught bits of but which only recently appeared on dvd after seeing this film i tried to track it down not knowing the name of it and finally found it in leonard maltin 's film guide check out his review they do n't make movies like this anymore that overused cliche is an understatement for this film where everything works especially the chemistry between sinatra and eleanor parker but the show stealer is his twelve year old son ally who takes care of the always drinking always dreaming sinatra edward robinson tries to straighten him out at bottom still believing in him if you 're wondering if capra ever made anything as endearing as it 's a wonderful life yes he did and here it is a great family film now on dvd
the films begins with picturesque shots of miami florida circa 1959 that alone could be worth the price of admission the exterior of the hotel that sinatra barely owns is the cordoza hotel in south beach sinatra 's voice can be heard over the opening credits singing the cahn husen song all my tomorrows '' frank is a single father trying to have all his dreams come true at once make time with swinging chicks and see that he is n't put out on the street because the mortgage is due on his two star hotel this was a play adapted for the screen by the playwrite it feels like the lead character was jewish for his parents have the requisite guilt devices but no matter all are terrrific the young man who plays his son eddie hodges was the little boy from the stage production of music man '' he was also a big hit on a musical quiz show name that partner on the show was pilot john glenn ! now that 's trivia of the highest order lots of great character actors thelma ritter edward g robinson and keenan wynn and local florida color and ca n't forget the charming duet sung by father and son '' high hopes '' adds up to a fun viewing i watch it every few years it holds up hey it 's a capra film and he never made a bad movie
the irony that seems to be lost on everyone in this movie is sinatra 's grand scheme he 's got this crazy idea about building a disney land in florida you remember the great scene at the dog track with keenan winn where he lays out the plan '' sure we pick up the land for a song and we 're in business '' keep in mind this is 1959 and even walt himself probably had n't thought about picking up all that property dirt cheap and developing the world 's largest theme park then again maybe walt saw hole in the head
sinatra is such a dufus in this movie he gives up the beautiful kooky goddess shirl carolyn jones just so he can play house with a chick besides that disappointment this is a wonderful film not to mention you get a fabulous performance of the song about the ant the rubber tree that just sticks in your head later a definate must see for any carolyn jones fan my favorite part is when she 's out surfing and comes from the water all salty two thumbs u
this movie combines two things i love in a film the actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents this is an improv lover 's dream and it makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously in this case dog shows only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog 's rating in context mainly though it is just hilarious some lot of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately and nearly too crude for me still it fits the genre
of christopher guest 's mockumentaries best in show '' is definitely the best the characters and story gel in a perfect comic concoction best in show '' is very different than waiting for guffman '' the first film in the guest trilogy although it brings back many of the same actors while guffman has a cruel streak in it best in show '' is a little kinder to the characters it skewers without losing the laughs i would skip the third film in the trilogy a mighty wind unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama it 's just not that funny if you are jonesing for a mockumentary fix search for '' a quirky comedy very much in the christopher guest vein it got a lot of great reviews and was even labeled the movie christopher guest should have made instead of a mighty wind
i was not privy to the world of christopher guest until a friend of mine told me that if i liked dead gorgeous ' then i would flip over any of guest 's films the video store only had one in and that was in show ' and i 'm sooooo glad they had it this film has to be one of the funniest films i 've ever seen a complete riot from beginning to end as a true ' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to ' the mayflower dog show the film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy there 's jennifer coolidge and patrick crenshaw play leslie and sherri ann ward cabot total spoof on the whole anna nicole smith scandal owners of a prize winning poodle who 's won in show ' 2 years straight and with the help of lesbian handler christy cummings jane lynch hopefully she 'll win for a third then there 's harlan pepper christopher guest himself a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist and there 's power comic couple eugene levy and catherine o'hara who play the flecks owners of a terrier who struggle with flecks long line of previous lovers there are lovers stefan scott michael mckean john michael higgins who spoil their shih tzu 's and each other but finally we have the star couple of the show the neurotic meg and hamilton swan parker posey michael hitchcock owners of beatrice and beautiful yet disturbed and ' weimaraner who 's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex their antics arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film and their chemistry is pure brilliance the film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken way to serious and with fred willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish
this is one of the most underrated comedies of
best in show '' is another of the very funny improvisational dialog movies that christopher guest has directed the situations are scripted by christopher guest and eugene levy but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running in this movie he takes aim at dog shows and the results speak for themselves the plot of this film is very simple as the audience is following 5 dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the mayflower dog show michael mckean and john michael higgins are hilarious as stefan vanderhoof and scott donlan the gay owners of miss agnes a shih tzu and parker posey and michael hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy win at all cost '' owners meg and hamilton swan of beatrice a weimaraner christopher guest plays harlan pepper the outdoorsman owner of hubert a bloodhound catherine o'hara and eugene levy are the mismatched couple cookie and gerry fleck who own winky a norwich terrier where gerry is a geek and cookie seems to have all over the country last but not least we have jennifer coolidge who plays sheri ann ward cabot the rich owner of the reigning champion rhapsody in white a poodle and jane lynch who plays christy cummings the trainer the other key members of the cast are fred willard who plays buck laughlin the tv announcer and jim piddock who is trevor beckwith the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for willard 's antics there are also some wonderful smaller roles such as larry miler as one of cookie 's and ed begley as the hotel manager those are just some of the names but i ca n't do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review the actors are the key to improvisation and the audience is in good hands with this movie the situations are funny but the performances are even funnier best in show '' premiered at the toronto film festival on september 2000. it was not nominated for any academy awards but it did win three american comedy awards including funniest motion picture funniest supporting actor in a motion picture fred willard funniest supporting actress in a motion picture catherine o'hara and christopher guest was also nominated for funniest supporting actor in a motion picture the film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the american cinema editors boston society of film critics british comedy awards canadian comedy awards the golden globes and many more this dvd includes an audio commentary by christopher guest and eugene levy which is somewhat but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention also available are quite a few deleted scenes you will also find the features which are almost standard at this point such as a trailer and profiles in my opinion this is the best of the improvisational films after this is spinal tap ''
set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog best in show is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud though there is a scripted premise most of the dialog in best in show is by comedic greats that include christopher guest catherine o'hara eugene levy and ed begley to name just a few the gist of best in show is simple five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other travel to philadelphia to enter the mayflower a prestigious championship dog show loosely based on the westminster event beatrice the emotionless weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple michael hitchcock and parker posey who are nervous wrecks read the crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog 's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru rhapsody in white the highly coiffed standard poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire 's trophy wife jennifer coolidge who is having an affair with christy cummings the dog 's severe lesbian trainer jane lynch winky a spunky norwich terrier is adored by a former party girl catherine o'hara and her nerdy two left footed husband eugene levy who at every turn is forced to confront his wife 's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills miss agnes the fluffy white shih tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men played brilliantly by michael mckean and his campy boyfriend john michael higgins hubert the bloodhound is shown by a single country boy played by christopher guest who created the series of mock documentary films that best in show is one part of there are far too many hilarious scenes in best in show to recount particularly great ones include the scene when winky 's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as ed begley another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator fred willard reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog 's trainers the judges and the clothing of its owners but perhaps my favorite scene is when winky 's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths they all jump '' best in show is a highly recommended dvd from the same mock documentary genre of this is spinal tap and waiting for guffman with star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish
certainly one of the funniest films ever great acting and directing especially suitable for dog owners but not limited to them
a lot of people have complained about this collection because they claim it does n't house de niro 's best films let me break it down this way warner released this box set as well as an al pacino version and they are only allowed to include films licensed through wb therefore most martin niro classics such as raging bull mgm taxi driver columbia casino universal etc can not legally be included they 'd have to make some sort of deal with all the major movie studios and that 's practically impossible so for what 's included here it 's a great place to start a de niro collection you can usually find it on the market for 59.99 divide it by five yeah it 's a pretty cheap deal when you consider the fact that these dvds by themselves cost around 11 12 in the average video store analyze this not a great film but de niro is very funny and it 's an essential de niro movie as it 's not only one of his best comedic performances but one of his most popular films if you 're a de niro buff and you do n't own this you might get some skeptical glances from other fans wag the dog an underrated sharp satire with a great ensemble cast well directed by barry levinson rain man '' i can see why some might not like it but if you enjoyed bulworth '' and similar political satires you 'll like this for the record i thought it was far subtler and more intellectual than bulworth '' was although they 're both fine comedies dustin hoffman is actually better than de niro in this in my opinion he 's really funny goodfellas this has since been released on a special edition dvd but this version is still good enough it 's got the same transfer as the se version and the trailers as well it does n't have the commentary or the documentaries but i heard the commentary split into different sections is a waste of time and the docs are only at 10 it 's a pretty good deal and one of the top five de niro films of all time you can always upgrade letter heat this has also been recently but nevertheless this disc is pretty good for an older dvd release the movie itself is awesome the new dvd is better but again you can always upgrade if you enjoy it enough a bronx tale robert de niro directed this and in my opinion it 's one of the greatest films ever made and unique because it deals with different aspects of the genre that even martin scorsese does n't touch upon in some of his films de niro is excellent in it and he does a terrific job behind the camera i 'm thrilled to hear he 's directing a film next year after seeing this i was in awe of just how talented he is behind the camera so overall if you 're new to de niro this is a good place to start and if you 're building up a collection there 's a good chance you 're going to want most of these films sooner or later at a pricetag of 60 it 's a pretty good deal and i 'd recommend it to anyone the only other de niro film i know of that wb had the rights to and should have included here was sleepers '' also directed by levinson wag the dog '' you should seek that out after buying this it 's a good movie
too good of an actor to not have put his better movies
i am a very big robert de niro fan this has some of his greatest roles but i strongly think that they should have replaced the bronx tale with taxi driver robert de niro is one of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen this collection shows us why
this is a good first start with excellent films the fans deserve a wider choice but it 's unfair for people to criticize the selection that was released in 1999 for not having films released in 2000
as a matt helm fan from 30 years ago this series of 4 movies was a blast from the past '' the gimics corny jokes and total disregard for political correctness '' combined to make excellent viewing highly entertaining
i thought dean martin was fantastic as matt i enjoyed all 4 movies it was great to travel back to the 60 's elke sommer stella stevens ann margret and senta berger were what great flicks ! ! ! ! ! rich crow
for those that love toungue in cheek comedy than this will suit you for those that enjoy being entertained with a non social meaning this is it dean martin as always leaves the viewer wanting more of his antics and as usual he always surrounds himself with a beavy of beautiful women for entertainment get it
in the 1960 's there was bond james bond then there was the man from wild wild west and our man flint and the biggest poke in the eye to bond matt helm dean martin did four matt helm films these films were all tongue and cheek all done for poking the spy genre in the eye these four films in this collection have action with so much comedy twists if you want humor with a 60 's bent this is it martin slick helm is fun to watch he essays the helm role with a girl in his bed a martini and satire humor one film the girl is listening to frank deadpans you like perry como '' these are cute thrillers will no real substance but you dont go to an austin powers movies for a real mystery either this is spy fluff that is funny and filling worth ten stars but they only allow me five bennet pomerantz audioworld
apparently there is more than one version of this set on the market one may be the unedited widescreen pictures version from amazon this is the one to get from the unjustified negative comments of some reviewers it seems that a second or bootleg version is also available the second verison can be distinguished from the sony version by the fact that the movies are displayed in a format the discs are a poor quality and the movies have been edited for broadcast tv channels why buy this set well you might smile when you see some of the outfits from the the dancing and the charms of stella stevens sharon tate elke sommer nancy kwan janice rule senta berger and others it 's obvious that dean martin was very lucky and he knew it it looks like everyone had a good time
it 's great that the studio 's is finally putting out a matt helm box set at a really great price compared to the more expensive separate fan of 60 's spy movies will love this martin 's tongue is firmly in his cheek and the women tina louise sharon tate ann margret and many many more what more can i recommended !
the mat helm movies are pretty funny and of course the girls are pretty but i imagine the folks from madd would be horrified to see how much they play up the dean as a boozer '' angle while he 's driving as someone else mentioned the station wagon spy car has a hidden bar with several bottles so dean does n't need to worry about running out of ammunition the joke they missed was calling the hidden bottles of booze his seat belts '' in another movie he 's got a more sporty car and in a chase scene you see one of that cars unique gadgets he picks up a microphone and says if you can read this you 're too close '' and the message scrolls across the tail lights i do see where these movies were an inspiration for the austin powers series my guess is these movies will be appreciated most by folks who remember dean martin and i think they would n't be a bad choice for kids because while there 's some suggestive stuff it 's tame by todays standards though obviously the do n't drink and drive '' message should be discussed
this set is a for all dean martin fans ! i really enjoy the fact that the matt helm character never takes himself too seriously he plays it for what it is sheer fun ! great looking babes groovy outfits and scripting and acting make this set as smooth as silk ! dean always looks like he just had a cocktail in every scene ! sure the critics will always make the 007 comparisons however i happen to enjoy both matt helm and james bond movies equally and the flint '' james coburn installment of films as well !
robert mcnamara is the consumate century man he is truly representative of his time the interesting little homilies that he claims he has gleaned from his expereinces are universal and true mcnamara displays all the qualities that made him the most effective secretary of defense in the century articulate thoughtful a natural debater and very very smart despite all the issues mcnamara says only what he want to even stating that he never never answers a question asked of him overall this is an excellent documentary it should be standard viewing for any american history course covering this period
former secretary of defense robert mcnamara is the focus of errol morris 's award winning engaging documentary the fog of war eleven lessons from the life of robert s mcnamara '' the film 's and personal approach to its subject offers an interesting and chilling look at america 's foreign policy during the years when mcnamara served as the secretary of defense under both kennedy and johnson the film also traces mcnamara 's wwii career as an officer in the army air force 's office of statistical control here he analyzed and improved the efficiency of bombing missions while ostensibly analyzing mcnamara 's 11 lessons of war the film also examines the underlying moral questions surrounding war is war justified is it avoidable and in hindsight is it worth the cost mcnamara frankly admits any military commander has made mistakes '' and on camera mcnamara discusses three main points in american century foreign policy the dropping of the atomic bombs on japan the cuban missile crisis and of course the vietnam war while mcnamara was not involved in the decision to drop nuclear weapons he states that this was unnecessary and not proportional '' he discusses his role in the cuban missile crisis claiming that he knew nothing at the time about america 's attempts to assassinate castro the cuban missile crisis serves as a good example however of lesson 1 empathize with your enemy '' mcnamara argues that it took tommy thompson understanding khrushchev to decide how to respond to the soviets when it comes to vietnam however mcnamara is much less of an apologist and much more slippery in hindsight it 's easy to see the vietnam war as totally unnecessary but mcnamara argues that the vietnam war was an intrinsic part of the cold war at the time 'saving ' vietnam from the communists was an imperative but now of course that just seems nonsensical but ideology aside chilling pivotal archival footage of conversations between mcnamara and kennedy and later johnson reveal that these men knew full well that vietnam was a hopeless war and yet they all sent men as fodder to the war machine for years mcnamara had misgivings about the war very early on and privately stated his dire reservations while publicly describing it as a battle to win the hearts and minds of the people '' these diametrically opposed opinions private and public illustrate the moral dissonance of those puppet masters who directed the vietnam war on tyranny and aggression '' no doubt if politicians were required to fight these wars they 'd create swift diplomatic conclusions the interviewer is remarkably soft with mcnamara and when tough questions are asked mcnamara illustrates his inherent nature as a politician lesson 9 in order to do good you may have to engage in evil '' offers marvelous opportunities for the ethical examination of war situations mcnamara jocularly explains a rule he lives by never answer the question asked of you answer the question you wish you 'd been asked '' mcnamara illustrates his point by failing to address questions regarding the moral consequences of his actions and even manages to speak of himself in the third person at a crucial moment still in spite of mcnamara 's evasiveness the documentary offers a unique opportunity to interview one of the architects of the vietnam war decades after the fact and asks what were you thinking '' the viewer will draw conclusions from both those questions answered and those questions studiously avoided displacedhuma
this documentary blew my mind so much that my husband and i watched it more than something we never do i liked it so myuch i sent it to my father and mother who had definate opinions of mcnamara and the war and this completely changed the way they saw everything my father is a war veteran and a buff of this kind of thing and even he learned a lot from it fantastic movie must see
one of the lessons '' that robert mcnamara imparts in this documentary is that in order to do good you may have to engage in evil '' this lesson essentially sums up the life of not only mcnamara but the history of the united states in the later half of the century however the question that the film really presents is just how much evil must one do to accomplish good in the final estimation did mcnamara do more good then evil morris does not answer this but makes it clear that this ultimate question can not be answered by simply plugging in numbers to an ibm machine one could be tempted to think that for every japanese life lost in the fire bombings in 1945 maybe 10 american lives were sparred from a land invasion of the home islands was that worth it for the lives lost in vietnam did mcnamara make this up in his leadership of the world bank there is not an answer to this question and even the subject of this documentary can not attempt to answer it without contradicting himself at one point in the interview mcnamara believes that he was acting as part of a machine but later on adds that he was acting as a war criminal during the bombing of japan does mankind abdicate his free will when the fog of war rolls in this is what makes this documentary so compelling is that it shows a 83 year old coming to grips with the reality of what he has done and what he has not done one could think that a viewer would have come away from this documentary with an understandable loathing for robert mcnamara after all he would be the prototypical target of such protest songs as dylan 's masters of war '' or the of the complex yet each time i watch the movie i do not feel anger towards him but i feel rather a partial remoteness that is hard to explain part of the explanation is that if placed in the same situation i know that i would have acted the same way i too would have followed orders from curtis lemay concerning the bombing of japan i also would have probably ran vietnam with the same attitude that mcnamara did now that we have seen that the lessons from vietnam were not read when it came to iraq one could only think of what george bernard shaw once wrote '' we learn from history that we learn nothing from history '' the fog of war '' is not a dry historical documentary but rather a primer on philosophy rationality and ultimately death
last night i watched the documentary fog of war about former secretary of defense robert macnamara the whiz kid who many call the architect of the vietnam war it is the portrait of a brilliant but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in arlington in which to bury jfk but is as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands while fighting hard to stay composed it is evident that macnamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them the experiences he recounts most notably in wwii devising ways for bomb to destroy most of japan killing over civilians a day to presiding over the dept of defense for eight years of the in vietnam are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations were he not on the side of good he observes at one point he would surely be tried as a war criminal to which i would add on a scale equal to hitler macnamara is a very bright man and the film is well done even if the interviewer could n't quite decide whether to be in it or not and therefore does n't use a microphone for his own questions it 's also a very valuable instructive tool recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the cuban missile crises the cold war world war ii and finally vietnam it is also heavily edited i would imagine so that macnamara could be firmly in charge pulling back and stepping forward as suits him it is therefore filled with omissions and lies the willingness of the to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at johnson 's insistence of the gulf of tonkin resolution a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence bush used to justify invading iraq although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people in the name of ideals and for our leaders he would hasten to add sounding very similar to generals in the third reich the film is especially chilling as it lays out eleven lessons for our nation several of which we are flagrantly violating today in iraq namely 1 2 6 7 8 11. in fact the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in indochina and our present situation in what was formerly persia are so profound it 's a wonder there are n't more documentaries novels essays and intelligent discourse on the subject read graham greene 's the quiet american written in the late and the folly of our efforts in vietnam is plain enough for an grader to get 1. empathize with your enemy 2. rationality will not save us 3. there 's something beyond one 's self 4. maximize efficiency 5. proportionality should be a guideline in war 6. get the data 7. belief and seeing are both often wrong 8. be prepared to reexamine your reasoning 9. in order to do good you may have to engage in evil 10. never say never 11. you ca n't change human nature what 's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as macnamara committed he is head and shoulders above dick cheney don rumsfeld and the rest of the bush administration that george bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious i wo n't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to jfk kruschev and even fellow texas cowboy lyndon johnson fog of war is an excellent film in macnamara shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters pure evil does exist it is in its most extreme as hannah arendt alleged after wwii banal
the oscar winning documentary studies the career of robert strange mcnamara savior of ford motor company architect of the viet nam war patron saint of the golbalization economy par excellence and imho one of the greatest villains of the century ok hes not on a level with stalin or hitler or walter o'malley but hes close the film manages to remain even handed about its subject something i would never be able to do and on that level it should be appreciated i think his fans will come away seeing him as a tragically flawed hero and his detractors like me will come away seeing him as the vile he is the movie demands that you think and for that alone it should be seen by any person interested in americas role in the world
a great look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider sobering context this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq
i lived through the vietnam era if you did you ca n't ever forget this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it for me here was the most unforgettable moment decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days macnamara tells him we the americans were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said macnamara you must have never read a history book ! we 've been fighting the chinese for a thousand years ! we are n't their puppet ! we were fighting for our national freedom ! we would have fought to the last man ! '' macnamara says they almost came to blows here 's the point macnamara says as compared to say the soviets we did n't understand the north vietnamese we did n't really know enought about them we had no idea what was in their minds and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons ! that 's why we lost ! does any of this sound familiar this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age it 's that good and that informative of course it wo n't be widely viewed by the american public we 'll go our goofy way coveting our tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things like sporting events
this reveals a great deal about vietnam and the 1960 's should be prized by students of kennedy johnson and our military history in the nuclear age
my first glimpse of errol morris ' work the thin blue line was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role and subsequent fallacy of human memory in historical discourse while the thin blue line '' examined a singular texas murder morris ' fog of war '' has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant year old mcnamara and his position in united states war policy over a thirty year span world war ii and vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary but the larger footprint '' of morris ' film rests with the controversial nature of mcnamara in the public 's mind versus the historical record in short mcnamara bears some responsibility and perhaps lingering guilt for his recommendations in the wwii bombing and the vietnam policy the vietnam war was not his action alone however he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act the president of the united states accordingly mcnamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition yet he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the era as well as the wwii bombing decisions mcnamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the american public want a criminal confession from the man with that public pitfall '' in mind mcnamara 's explanations and answers to morris ' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework at one point in the film morris ' essentially asks mcnamara who was responsible for vietnam decisions and mcnamara quickly replies the president '' the audience or at least i wanted mcnamara to answer it was my decision '' and as such may view the president response as a however mcnamara is absolutely correct the decision for action rested with the and his name was never robert strange mcnamara from the audience 's perspective it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting not damning the two presidents he served and loved personally i relished the personal insights morris captured or that mcnamara permitted himself to show these poignant glimpses ranged from mcnamara 's tearful story of surveying arlington national cemetery for kennedy 's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the mcnamara family during the secretary of defense years my favorite insight into mcnamara 's soul comes during the retelling of the young quaker who set himself on fire below mcnamara 's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander while the story is well known mcnamara pays respect to the widow 's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter i am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film in terms of filmmaking some reviews have blasted morris ' technique of being off camera and unmiked his use of the glass soundtrack or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes bombing or protests in many respects they are right either you love morris ' methods or they will grate on you the editing cuts can be choppy but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material if you enjoy a bombastic michael figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric then the fog of war '' may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental on the other hand if you enjoyed morris ' earlier the thin blue line '' or barbara kopple 's harlan county usa '' and american dream '' then you will want to buy this dvd for the theatrical release deleted scenes and mcnamara 's own rules
of course hindsight is always nice in cases like this but i was a huge supporter of this film when it was still 'against the country ' to do so i reviewed it back then for 'another ' publication and of course as we know many people lost their jobs over such a 'treasonous act ' fortunately i was not one of them but time has revealed to almost all that the bush administration lied from the and has been lying ever since and contrary to one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida knock it off ! ! ! ! ! ! when the ' recount was done it never took into account all the 'illegal ' butterfly ballots that had candidates names on both sides of the ballot which is againast florida state law causing many to vote for pat buchanan by accident no to mention the disinfranchised democrats who were n't allowed to vote due to republican and the sad fact that by now that i would still have to tell anyone left in america about the wicked ways of this administration just goes to prove that some no matter how much truth is placed before them will still ignore common sense and follow the path that leads to their own destruction next time this country better not wait for the 'bell curve ' to catch up with those who already
fahrenheit just blew my mind when i saw it it gives a complete new perspective on the politics of the us and on bush 's administration the film 's objectivity is not to be questioned cause michael moore gives clear evidence on everything this movie really shows what america is like in this new era and how innocent people die for its welfare i am amazed that this film was actually released for the open public and that the author was n't hanged on the street i would n't be surprised if that happened
out of 5 stars i give it a 10. if you have n't seen it you 're missing the past two decades the information is right on the money in more ways than one
film footage was really important i did not know that bush had his car egged when he was inagurated the time i did not know that he was the president not able to walk his last leg to the inaguration because of protests i did not know because the bush administation had the media supressed at that time i thought this movie was really important because it got out info for the time that we could not see before i would take a look at it and you can see things you did not see and know some things that you did not know see for yourself it is a rental now
it 's a great resource covering selecting a breed of dog tips related to training and information related to dog behavior it shows footage of dogs in different situations and a little of john fisher but the narrator often talked over him the final chapter chapter 8 was an interesting recital of a personal experience john fisher had with a challenging dog and how he handled it this dvd is an overview and not heavily focused on oral commands
i enjoyed each of the friday series i reviewed the original way back and now after next friday i thought i 'd finally get around to reviewing this i still think i enjoyed friday the best but this is a good follow up ice cube returns as craig jones who has a knack for getting into trouble he goes to stay with family out in rancho cucamonga they 've just won the lottery and have this whole new place while chris tucker is n't in here this time we still get the hilarious john witherspoon he 's fantastic i only give this four stars because it goes a little flat during the second half but it 's still good overall the cousin is probably the funniest but if you are a fan of the original then you have got to see this i loved it
but a decent sequel but hey it 's not often that the sequel is better than the prequel i was mad because alot of questions were not answered and the plot was not all that good i wanted craig ice cube to hook up with that girl next door all she does is have a short convo with her and at the end she blows a kiss and thats the end i believe thats pointless for craig 's pops jon witherspoon drops him off in rancho cucamonga i do n't think i spelled it right then turns around and picks him up its a funny movie but not as good as the first though
i thought next friday was way better than the original the first movie was really slow in the beginning slow that i fell asleep as soon as you pop this movie in you 'll be laughing from beginning to end mike epps is hilarious as craigs cousin and craigs father has some pretty funny lines in this one rent it you wo n't be sorry
next friday was so much better than the first one with much more funnier scenes and this movie is reccommended for everyone
i enjoyed ice cube in this movie but i think and uncle elroy could have been funnier debo was the best part along with the new character sticky fingaz but wtf happened to debo
i grew up reading the eloise books and always loved them we read those stories over and over and thought that eloise and all of her antics were hillarious to the point that my sister and i wanted to be eloise however when my sister purchased this movie for my 3 year old daughter i was a little concerned though i love the eloise stories i did n't necessarily think that eloise was the best role model for my impressionable young daughter however to my very happy surprise disney has managed to present an adorable sweet caring version of the little girl from the books while still staying true to so many of her little quirks and mischief that make her so lovable and entertaining this movie is very well acted all around especially by the eloise and nanny julie andrews characters both of whom have a warmth and sweetness not evident in the book that only adds to movie version and makes it much more appropriate for kids purists of the book that are looking for pure sass and troublemaking in eloise may thinik the movie too soft but it is a perfect interpretation for family viewing this is a great movie that can be enjoyed not only at christmas but throughout the year
i ca n't say that i toatlly enjoyed the first eloise made for movie by disney but my youngest cousin wanted to give this a go for family movie night around the holidays i watch it and was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed it little eloise is done wonderfully by sophia who plays the michviously little girl who just loves christmas at the plaza eloise manages to change lives close to christmas day having old friends as lovers and rescue a friend from a doomed marriage or help a grieving mother manage to stay at her home not to mention getting into plenty of trouble and buying heaps of presents eloise all in all has the life every little girl wants to have i found myself dreaming about being at the plaza at christmastime myself my little cousin loved the movie and i enjoyed it myself it 's a perfect movie to add to your christmas collection or just to watch with your kids right now we 're watching it in febuary ! ! ! it 's a great treasure and i can only hope this is n't the last in the eloise series
unlike the curmudgeon above i enjoyed this movie because i took it as it was intended a children 's movie i have a 6 year old daughter who is exposed incessantly to appeals to the lowest common denominator in the form of twisted concepts of human sexualtiy myopic schooling and rank commercialism amongst others i am attempting with everything in me to rear a daughter with self confidence intelligence and above all the will to express herself in the face of adversity while i have substantial concern with the setting of eloise the underlying themes of the film i believe supercede the lifestyle of privlege portrayed these themes are independence of thought self confidence innocence as a power for good and the triumph of the free thinker over social castes it is indeed pablum but pablum is extremely beneficial in it 's context this film is light hearted amusing shallow and utterly enchanting for the young at heart including reluctant adults disney has it 's place and should not be rearing our children but for a parent with interest in their child 's upbringing able to reinforce the beneficial aspects of the film this quintessentially disney movie is entirely pleasant peace someone 's daddy
eloise she is such fun and i wish that i could live in the plaza and share her adventures and be her 'mostly companion ' eloise played by sophia vassilieva was a perfect choice and was absolutely divine and of course julie andrews ! ! ! she is wonderful ! everyone in this film is just so wonderful that you feel that you are there ! everything is realistic but make believe at the same time ! eloise the clever bratty fun loveable sweet and so caring is just the character that little girls love ! this movie is about 4 really main characters eloise of course bill the waiter nanny nanny and rachel the plaza owners daughter eloise becomes involved in matchmaking when rachel returns from college with her fiance eloise and her become friends and she finds out that rachel loved the plaza when she was her age she also finds out that her and bill are old sweethearts and still secretly in love against the will of her father who wants her to marry someone of importance and brooks her fiance is in his opinion perfect but eloise discovers brookes secret and contrives plots to get him out of the way and to put bill in his place whether it 's being kidnapped spying or helping the awful thornton have a merry christmas kevin lima makes eloise shine in the true spirit of the holidays ! merry christmas !
eloise is a girl while her mom travels the world eloise sofia vassilieva spends most of her time in new york city 's plaza hotel where she lives with her mostly companion '' rawther british nanny julie andrews eloise has quite the reputation at the plaza all of the employees know her routine daily adventures of curiousity and mischief eloise at christmastime is the second wonderful world of disney television movie adapted from kay thompson 's popular line of picture books filmed directly after eloise at the plaza this 2003 film retains director kevin lima and all of the relevant cast of its predecessor it 's christmastime in new york city and eloise anticipates her mother 's return home meanwhile in her ritual explorations eloise discovers a different return the daughter sara topham of plaza owner peabody victor young has come home to be married on christmas eve to brooks oliver rick roberts a young man that eloise has her suspicions about eloise 's journeys around the plaza also uncover that the crabby thornton 's days at the plaza may be numbered though not as she first assumes and the precocious girl later learns that her best friend and regular room service provider bill gavin creel still has feelings for his the rachel peabody who he has n't seen in years the film is comfortable in exploring the plaza with the same pace and perspective of its rambunctious young matchmaker protagonist it 's never in any hurry to bring you the upbeat conclusion you seem to anticipate instead choosing to bask in the drama and fun of eloise 's experiences from the title you can imagine that christmas figures largely in the film and it does we see eloise going shopping around manhattan her ease contrasts with nanny 's struggle to find the perfect gift for sir wilkes adding to her growing list of things she 'd like to get and inadvertently and repeatedly thwarting nanny 's efforts to decorate their suite but christmas is one element and not the entire film so we 're not simply getting the same tale that 's been played out in countless other holiday tv movies the central story actually seems better developed and more compelling than the screenplay for eloise at the plaza did whereas that one split its interest more evenly between its royalty and romance subplots this film primarily focuses on the potential between bill and rachel and eloise 's efforts to put them together the setting of christmas adds a layer of depth but never dominates all in all christmastime succeeds as much as and even more than plaza again making good use of eloise 's infectious spirit and this time for a more engaging story julie andrews and the remarkable sofia vassilieva have winning chemistry and their characters ' relationship adds a bit of resonance to make the rest of this jovial comedy echo a little more poignantly even if it 's a tiny bit formulaic eloise at christmastime compares favorably with a good amount of the theatrical live action fare that walt disney pictures have put out in recent years you will simply love this movie its one to have in your collection !
i first saw this movie on television it is a funny christmas movie for the entire family this holiday season grow young through the story of eloise at christmastime
i think that this like eloise at the plaza is a great movie it is one that childern of all ages can really enjoy i really ca n't think of anyone that would not enjoy this movie i also think that elise at the plaza is a great movie for all
i have 5 children ranging from 14 years to 20 months and they all loved this movie i rented the video and after watching it went right out and bought it the next day eloise was fun the movie was lighthearted and watchable by all ages the little girl who plays eloise was such a gem julie andrews was just as wonderful as nanny as she was as mary poppins this is a movie i could enjoy watching over and over again
this was a funny film about admiring people kate bosworth is perfect in the lead role as a west virginia grocery clerk who has a crush on a movie star what she does n't know is that a fellow employee has similar feelings for her when she wins a contest to be with the star the movie star starts idolizing her complications ensue i think this was a romantic movie that had its moments i recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies shake a doo
this is one of the movies me and my friend turn to when we want a movie that gives you a bubbly warm feeling inside in the movie rosalee bosworth is totally in love with movie star tad hamilton tad has a bit of well a bad image and as a hope to clean his image up a bit he teams up with save the children so that with an applicatio and 100 donation some lucky girl get to go on a date with tad that girl is rosalee tad falls an love with her after the date and trackes her down in frasier bottom west virginia meanwhile rosalee 's friend pete is madly in love with her it has one of those feel good ending where rosalee and tad realize that they are not right for eacher other and after a small chase rosalee and pete end up together now they need a sequel for pete and rosalee
win a date with tad hamilton is such an adorable movie certainly not one i 'd recommend to the guys but for all of us ladies this movie 's a treat bosworth is cute and refreshing in this romantic comedy i love topher grace from that 70 's show but his character in this is quite similar to his bumbling eric forman still that did n't stop me from enjoying this film i think every woman at some point in her life has dreamt of what it would be like to go out with the celebrity of their dreams if you 're a fan of romantic comedies you 'll absolutely adore this little movie that claimed a big chunk of my heart very rewatchable and very recommended
this is a sweet comedy with alot of formula but it works ! sometimes you have to fight for love and it takes something like a movie star moving in on the girl to push you to action predictable but funny is n't love worth fighting for
she is unrealistically cute in this movie ! this is a movie i would never have gone to or rented but it happened to be on some movie channel and i saw kate bosworth and man she is so adorable and cute and whatever so i watched the second half and thought this aint half bad of a movie as a matter of fact i think i like it alot so i kept a look out and next time it came i i watched it all and really enjoyed it without kate bosworth this movie would have not been so great she makes it what it is because she is uniquely cute the plot is that she works in a grocery store where the dorky eyed manager likes her but she wins a date with tad hamilton who turns out to be not such a punk but he ca n't come up with good lines to say to her so he steals the dorky guys lines but when she fines out on the plane she makes him take her back to the dorky guy who is getting advice from the troglodyte bartender chick who thinks he 's really hot there is a great line in this movie said by the bartender which was worth the price of admission free on my tv '' everybody is tad hamilton to somebody '' usually somebody they wouldnt be caught dead with but its nice to know anywayz
i loved it is cute ! i really liked the parts about rosalee having 6 smiles its cute ! it was a little on the predictable side though i really did like the ending though
hollywood occasionally produces a underrated sweet and genuinely fun romantic comedy that flies beneath everyone 's radar win a date with tad hamilton is one of those movies perhaps because of the unwieldy title or because it was surrounded by more hyped movies when it was released it never got the recognition it deserved starring a radiant kate bosworth a sweet and touching topher grace and a suprisingly good josh dushamel win a date flips the romantic formula a bit pitting an ordinary hometown boy against the perfect hollywood star all for the love of an innocently beautiful woman rosalee futch played by the radiant kate bosworth is a prototypical naive romantic downhome small town girl she has a sweet widower dad gary cole a quirky friend and a job at the local piggly wiggly with her life long buddy pete topher grace who is hopelessly in love with her but never has acted on it this is not suprising though if you are best friends with the perfect woman you will sometimes take friendship over potential rejection there is just something about grace as an actor though that is sweet and endearing and makes you root for him meanwhile rosalee 's favorite hollywood star tad hamilton josh dushamel is having a few problems with the tabloids splashing his boozing womanizing reckless behavior all over the front pages in need of some image makeover his management team nathan lane and sean hayes creates a old hollywood style win a date contest which rosalee wins not all that suprisingly rosalee sparks something inside tad on their date and he chases after her back to her small town in west virginia where he must compete with pete for her love funny sweet and occasionally dorky win a date is a fine movie for a evening at home and a nice addition to a romantic comedy collection
i ca n't believe i 'm saying this 's a great movie ! my wife wanted to see this movie and forced me to sit there and watch it i 'm glad she did ! look i 'm not saying that this is life is beautiful but for what it is it 's dam good ! bosworth shines radiantly unlike the beyond the sea disaster duhammel steals every scene he 's in and ginnifer goodwin is outstanding in what is supposed to be a flunky role she turns it around and is memorable as the lighthearted sidekick for bosworth she 's extremely attractive to boot ! kind of like jennifer tilly with a whole lot more class and without the irritating baby voice as for tophar did find him a bit grating i would have preferred somebody like toby mcguire but not enough to dimminish this fine piece of fluff so do yourself a favor and buy it i 'm sure you 'll want to see it over and over again a winner
this movie was superb i wish it was available in pal not just 's ntsc format i was both inspired not only with it 's hysterical insightful humour but with it 's global appeal it brings out themes that everybody can relate to not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes the movie has great wit and side splitting humour it 's such fun to watch and this man is a star ! he really should be more widely recognised a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character time to come and do a show in south africa too ! what a talent ! ! !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we do n't have the same taste in movie
great entertainment for the whole family tyler perry can present the most serious problems in this country today and still make you laugh
anything madea is in is worth watching ! this movie had it all i loved it
a large cast of well known actors such as cicely tyson do an outstanding job in this movie tyler leaves you with that warm and fuzzy feeling
this is a good movie ! it is better than diary of a mad black woman
blair underwood own 's this he plays an abusive fiance with a passion for getting his kicks off by beating the love of his life everyday bret fetzer movie reviewer is not abreast to the diversity of blair underwood 's brilliant performances such as just cause 1995 and asundar 1998 in which he plays a psycopath be it psycopath sociopath you name it and blair underwood will claim it ! !
to those who hate '' this movie please forgive us culturally depraved lowly scum for daring to appreciate the pure entertainment and moral value of a polished movie that seeks to depict the good and bad within our diverse attitudes and ways of life let 's not forget that this is just a movie and tyler perry has ingeniously used this medium in a way that does n't take itself too seriously only someone with more of an open mind could appreciate that and know that there are some things you simply wo n't get '' not being that does n't mean everyone who 's black will like this film but clearly by the majority of reviews on this web site there 's a reason this film rates so highly among us po ignorant '' dark masses ! SMILE tyler keep doing what you 're doing ! signed a lover and participant of all legitimate art both high '' and low '' as long as it 's relevant peace
this show is absolutely hilarious but it is unpolished and can be difficult to watch at times it falls short of the brilliant '' label some attach to it but you have to appreciate the risky and absurd humor given the time period this show aired and the humor of the time the same can be said for its garry shandling 's show which i would also like to see released on dvd please the zoo animals on wheels episode is a classic on the first dvd the prettiest day of my life and bored straight are two of my favorite all time episodes but where are the other episodes rhino my niece can copy the dvds for you if you 're busy she knows how to do it she has plenty of free time just let me know
it is ridiculous to only release this hilarious show in such small increments ! it is my favorite sitcom of all time but i refuse to buy it unless they put out a set including all the episodes or at least the entire first season
i always remembered this show for a few different reasons maybe because of how freaking stupid this guy was and some of the bizarre plots i always remembered this one episode imparticular the one where they build the submarine and put it in their bathtub i always thought about that one whenever i would talk to someone about this show so when i saw they were availiable i had to get them both but the only thing wrong is they need to release all of the shows if you like weird comedy please buy and enjoy if you do n't get yourself straightened out and watch it as well
i have to say i am a fan of chris elliott and have watched him in many different shows and movies and always liked his kind of sarcastic wit and i think get a life was a great example of his odd talents in the later episodes the earlier episodes that are available on dvd all 8 are not really the best examples of his work they are funny but the later episodes with gus '' larry '' and sharon '' crack me up i am tired of seeing this limited run of only a few select early episodes available through dvd it 's time to release the rest or at least a few more i mean if shows like saved by the bell '' can be a box set on dvd then i think the flood gates have been opened release the rest of the episodes rhino what are you waiting for
this dvd offers a rare opportunity to some of us the diehard fans of this sitcom which appeared on fox network in late and this is one of the few funniest tv comedies ever created that did not succeed in tv ratings because it was not aired on a major network this show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word he lives with his retired parents and run into all kinds of zany sometime antics that provides entertainment to young and old it was quite disappointing to many of us that it did not reappear in reruns but this dvd offers a rare opportunity to view four episodes all episodes are funny which offers great value for the money let us hope the success of this dvd may persuade producers of the show to market all episodes and a dvd with 12 episodes is made available to all the fans
i am a fan of several of atom egoyan 's films and was curious about the milieu of this one since seeing it i find my mind drifting back to it with some consistency empirically speaking i know it affected me on some levels that i 'm only dimly aware of i thought kevin bacon 's take on a character meant to remind us of the older jerry lewis was rich and daring colin firth made an indelible impression as his straight man the repressed but debonair brit standing in for dean martin 's suave alison lohman seems not quite up to her key role and i found myself wondering if egoyan might have had someone more cerebral like sarah polley he cast her so perfectly in the sweet hereafter in mind instead a classic whodunit dressed up in artsy chronology you will find yourself changing your mind a few times about what really happened before the final scenes
sad to say that many of the fashions worn in the are back on the racks at the mall these days but that 's off the topic i enjoyed this movie and that 's a rare thing the bouncing back and forth in time got to be very confusing and irritating but in spite of that the movie survived while i could have done without quite as much of the sex scenes really some subtlety could have conveyed the information just as well i did n't find them as offensive as some like those in deadwood just relax let the lines blur and see if you have any of those drugs
actually a really good movie but trying hard to mimic hitchcock and failing the reason for the failure is flipping back and forth between time periods and povs as well as trying to have too many elements in one viewing which was never a hitchcock failing you have to watch this one more than once then even watch the deleted scenes on the dvd to get the full story and there 's a couple of elements i still find confusing or contradictory and gave up the problem is trying to tell too much story the basic devise of using a period film setting circa 1970 to have a young journalist investigate the partnership of a famous comedy duo of the and why they broke up or rather what happened the week before they broke up which happens to be the same week she met the duo as a child when she was a guest on their annual telethon you see where this is going but do n't think too much of martin and lewis but rather how much the screenplay is already working real hard to establish relevance the night before said journalist as a child met the entertainment stars a young woman died and this woman was later found in the stars ' hotel suite no blame accorded ruled a suicide all the journalistic ws who what when where why basically swept under the rug stylish though the presentation of all this is the fact is the story of the duo itself is the real film their relationship and career and even the who works for one of them the dead girl and the journalist so much time is spent on them when they 're not what holds the film together it 's really about what happened to that team and you 'd like to see their rise to stardom more about the ins and outs of the business especially during a time when entertainers performed in clubs and those clubs were controlled by mob bosses the rise of narcotic use and the acceptance and encouragement of alcohol abuse peculiar to the all of that is what 's really interesting and glimpsed but unfortunately the format and the pacing do n't leave us much time to enjoy duo 's background and the performances of kevin bacon and colin firth both of whom age convincingly about 15 years but unfortunately they do n't bring off the stage appeal and comedy required though they try hard in fact they try so hard the internal sweat is visible but the screenplay does n't live up to the duo 's legend let 's say in sum a couple of sexy scenes one for the lesbian lovers another for providing the hint of a reason why the comedic duo remained unmarried yet broke up despite all the and the dead girl one of their shared beauties a stunning actress who manages to steal the film in her scenes
this movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun it is the furthest thing from a documentary the technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer the source is glossy and gorgeous the director 's clout is also impressive johnny depp gives a performance monologue as jack kerouac and john torturro gives an emotional reading from howl '' dennis hopper imitates burroughs as well later in the film their efforts are impressive just to let the skeptics out there know there is no room for doubt in this documentary the beats are heroes and saviors and not much else is considered that some of them were minor talents is brushed over massive beat generation fans would give it five stars a totally sanitized version of william burroughs is presented and it is implied that kerouac was only a heterosexual which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious the film 's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted one memorable quotation was you can overdose on anything including sushi '' well no not really it does not matter though the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off
this is a serious documentary on the beat hippie movement it has tons of old footage and interviews with many of the most prominent beat figures like ginsberg kerouac burroughs corso ferlinghetti etc etc it has historical footage of events like the democratic national convention in and the in san francisco in this is the perfect movie for someone who loves the beats or someone who has never heard of them i did n't know much about them when i first watched this documentary on pbs but after watching it i immediately became interested in their movement i started reading a lot of the major works like on the road naked lunch and howl and turned into a major fan this movie is exceptionally and presented it does have some hollywood stars like johnny depp but they are only reading the works of beat authors and do not have a major role this is just a great documentary which contains valuable information and interviews with major beat characters who have since passed away this is a must have for any fan of the beats hippies yippies drugs american literary movements the counterculture or just good documentaries in general i absolutely love it and have watched it several times
the source '' is an excellent documentry on 'the beat generation ' it was so good i saw it twice in the theaters the documentry has a wealth of new material as long as familiar classic footage my personal favorite writer jack kerouac came out of the beat generation and it was fantastic to see him and learn more about him the documentry always explores other key figures like ginsberg burroghs cassidy among others three actors recite famous works by kerouac ginsberg and burroghs johnny depp and dennis hopper do fair jobs at working with material by kerouac and burroghs but chuck workman slaughters ginsberg 's poem howl '' the only fault about this documentry was the previous and that it had to end check the source '' out
this is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject the clips of ginsberg burroughs are especially effective the celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself not just empty theatrics the beats are still a source to return to for inspiration insight the world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now of course there 's more but this video gives you enough to get you started gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late
when kerouac ginsberg and burroughs set out in their writing they had no idea what it would create a whole movement this film including interviews taken when ginsberg and burroughs were alive assembles clips from media film and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up to the of ginsberg and burroughs with a large assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced carroll and bukowski it is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement it is interesting to see the beat propaganda of the sixties how negative and mocking the media treated the sense of a cool '' movement they painted a false portrait this film is for lovers of beat or people genuinely interested however if you do not like documentaries you wo n't like this one also i was disappointed to see depp hopper and turturro reciting long pieces of work when the actual writers could have performed it honestly i skipped these parts i wanted to see ginsburg doing howl '' another disappointment is the dvd version which was slapped together on the fly i envisioned additional clips and useful information let 's face it you can put tons on a dvd but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited for making the movie and the trailer in this case not exciting however with all disappointments aside this film is good for a few viewings it conveys a better picture of the beats than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the material
comming of age in the 80 's is getting made fun of lately but i thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of aids people were dieing so fast and i lost teachers to that it was not like today this movie is really good and in the 1980 's style it is a great comedy if you like the 80 's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying bueller repeated times see this movie you will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie anyway perhaps you just might like the 80 's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music
bueller ferris bueller ok lets start off with what wrong with this edition of ferris bueller 's day off there are two problem i see with this new bueller bueller dvd edition of ferris one is the over use of it all ben stein and the missing director john hughes 's missing audio commentary now the good news there are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie and then there is the movie extras are fine however the film is a minor classic matthew broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye broderick 's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience he is part robert preston from the music robert wagner from it takes a thief broderick playing ferris is slick sly and a con man with style he pokes a stick of his collective eye of principal jeffrey deadwood jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment the supportive cast of alan spin city ruck and mia sara makes a sorta lover 's triangle without love nor deeper friendship the two combined with broderick makes this film a buddy movie rather than a teen angst film like not another teen movies or ten things i hate about you so want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked get this film and as ferris would say what are you still doing here why are n't you buying this yet '' bennet pomerantz audioworl
ferris bueller matthew broderick is a kind of hero to every aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye alan ruck a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick '' day for him his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his sister jeannie jennifer grey who suspects something is up as does the dean of students ed rooney jeffrey jones it 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days it 's amazing people like his parents who are most easily duped would think that this one sick kid when in reality he 's having a ball however knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile ferris and cameron bail out ferris ' girl sloane mia sara with a dead grandmother ploy and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the gt convertible oh yeah ! this movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time it 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life for after all as our hero says life moves pretty fast if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while you might miss it '' that 's the moral of the story really bueller bueller bueller '' not here but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day
perfect movie for everyone no matter how many times i watch the movie it is always funny whether you are stll in school or schools days are behind you this movie will make you feel good
matthew broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school what happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy broderick stars as ferris bueller a somewhat clever and deceitful in a funny way high school senior who along with his best friend cameron alan ruck decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown chicago in springtime ferris convinces cameron to take his father 's prized red ferrari out for the day reluctantly cameron agrees and soon the two are off on their adventure their next plan is to get ferris ' girlfriend sloane mia sara out of school so she can go along ferris and cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell dean of students ed rooney jeffery jones that sloane 's grandmother passed away dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat ferris arrives at the school to pick up sloane and the three drive happily away however rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that ferris is at the root of it he sets off to find ferris himself and bring him back to school by the end of the movie rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office meanwhile ferris ' sister jeannie jennifer grey has figured out what ferris is really doing angry that ferris seems to get away with everything she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor sick ferris while she really knows what is going on in the end though she proves to be a big help to him after heading downtown the trio take the ferrari to a local parking garage cameron 's father knows the exact mileage of the car so cameron is already nervous about allowing ferris to drive it but that 's just the beginning the garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer during their day ferris cameron and sloane manage to see the sears tower a cubs game visit the art institute and see ferris sing twist and shout '' from a parade float but when they head back to the garage to get the car ferris finds out about the extra mileage and cameron goes crazy ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse however the miles do n't come off cameron having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents takes out his aggression on the car soon it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him but ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do will he make it in time this movie has attained a sort of cult '' status over the years and still remains as funny as ever matthew broderick is perfect as the scheming ferris while jeffery jones does a very good job as rooney jennifer grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly and alan ruck 's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless ferris let 's not forget the funny cameo by ben stein as the teacher who coined the term anyone anyone bueller '' i recommend this extremely funny movie very highly the acting is great and the story is very funny as a cubs fan i was glad to see the scenes in wrigley field and hear harry caray 's voice watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day
one of john hughes best films ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were love this film
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! ! rock o
my brother is cameron fry and it was n't until his first year in college that he found his ferris bueller this is a classic that every high school student should see it 's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best it 's easy to tell from this film that matthew broderick was destined to be a star
a movie with one good line after another funny and interesting characters and lttle vignettes of hilareous bit part players just a great funny movi
i really like this dvd i watched it all the way through on the first viewing but will have to go back again and again there 's just so much stuff in there fast paced and never boring and everytime it came to an end of a section i got up to turn it off only to be greeted with more i several good tips that were worth the price of admission not to mention the dozens and dozens more that i will have to go back and evaluate to see if they 're for me a convivial host i only wish he spent more time on landscape and less time on pumas still was very worth it
as an intermediate photographer i found this dvd very enjoyable its packed with useful information geared primarily towards the beginner to intermediate photograper jim keeps the terminology very simple and his instructions are easy to follow and understand he covers many aspects of photography from composition lighting locations as well as camera functions etc and he does n't overwhelm you with technical jargon all in all a nice dvd for anyone looking to improve their photography and even for advanced photographers it could serve as a nice refresher course i would also recommend his book 'the betterphoto guide to digital photography ' as many of the subjects and pictures from the dvd are included in more detail
the dvd is excellent as far as i got to see it unfortunately about two thirds of the way through the picture or my dvd player went nuts and i never got to see the last part i tried several times perhaps i am having a dvd player problem but it plays others without a problem
this is an excellent introduction to photography film or digital it was a little basic for me but on the other hand it was good to do the review of basics i gained alot from the instructions on techniques i recommend it for anyone except the very advanced photographer

this dvd is and full of see a hugh difference in my photos using the advice given by jim miotke i highly recommend this dvd
i watched and liked the movie but it did n't leave room for a series to follow or preceed it so i did n't hold out high hopes for this when it was available cheap though i decided to pick it up and i 'm very glad i did this is another version of the same story told in the movie so treat the two as separate it brings in mecha but not as a dominant feature as well as aspects of starstruck romance love triangles and a bit of fantasy intrigue blending them into a consistent story i do think parts were a bit drawn out and the isaac newton reference was a bit silly but these were n't enough to bring down the story on the other hand the characters are multifaceted bringing a healthy range of emotions into play without seeming forced or trite i mainly took off a point for the artwork and the plot being drawn out at points the artist does n't know how to draw a nose ca n't say i do either but i 'm not selling my work which becomes obnoxious at times if you can get past the noses it 's well worth a look
i was one of those unfortunate enough to catch escaflowne on fox kids truth is that i was hooked it was one of the first anime i ever saw before i even knew what anime was i didnt get to see the whole series on fox but i always wanted to see the whole thing and i finally got my chance this series is truly a gem among anime it 's got a heartfelt story with some action thrown into the mix as well as a bit of comic relief thanks to merle true that the characters look a bit funny but that 's only at the beginning after a while you completely forget about it and fall completely in love with them flaws and all it really has nothing in common with the movie other than that the characters are the same so if you didnt like the movie give the series a chance it has a more fully developed story and really fleshes out the characters better i enjoy watching dubs so i watched it both in it 's original and dubbed the japanese is great and cant be compared with the subbed but if you are to lazy to read than the dubbed version is fine as well plus you get all of the episodes for such a great price how can you beat that if you 're in the mood for a great story definetly buy this
escaflowne was probably the first anime show i ever watched ! i was instantly hooked and just had to buy it now even though it 's been several years since i saw the show it 's about a girl named hitomi who gets transported to a mystical world called gaea there she teams up with a king a knight a princess and others to save their world it 's hard enough being a teenager on earth but being a teenager trapped on another world well you can tell that she 'll have difficulties not to mention love interests the fight scenes are good and i love all of the creative characters such as merle the ! buy it and you wo n't regret it ! it 's a great show
when it comes to the great classics of anime history there are a few that stand out anime like gundam and macross the genre known as mecha these shows are known for their drama romance intrigue beautiful animation classic musical scores and giant humanoid robots who 's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil shoji kawamori 's classic macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys mecha sagas delivering all the required elements in huge way shoji kawamori is a genius whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics why do i mention this because in addition to macross he created escaflowne what is escaflowne it is quite frankly the greatest television show i have ever seen in my life it is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the it is a fantasy epic set in a world that 's a cross between medieval europe and the eastern regions it is a story of an ordinary girl named hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior her destiny intertwined with its heros it is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction it is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom a cute princesses merchants villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters and of course the giant stone mecha that could save the world or perhaps destroy it if there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show this is it there is character development like the perfect knight who has a hidden past or the brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother an incredible plot the lost people of atlantis an engine which can alter fate and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a utopia of perfect happiness technology like the coolest mecha i have ever seen anywhere the guymelefs or is it romance complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing action sequences to die for giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords ! ! ! invisible giant robots with tentacle weapons ! dragons ! ! ! and characters that are very deep indeed hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story although many people prefer japanese to english in their anime this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch with great performances the standout though is probably the voice of folken played to perfection by paul dobson the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck and one scene had me ready to cry the animation and art is also quite glorious featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of gundam wing but with better use of color and far more complex and beautiful backgrounds i must say that the soundtrack of escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted i currently have 3 cds of the music and i plan to buy the others one day and i listen to it a lot yoko kanno 's score for this anime could best be likened to some of john william 's best as it has hints of john williams ' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion as well as choral chants for key moments take the piece dance of curse '' for instance it reminds one a lot of duel of the fates '' but it came out first and personally i think it 's better played only twice during the entire show it 's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted and i havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the incredible theme that ends the last episode in the end escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic it 's directed as well or better than the best movies of hollywood history using dramatic angles and the like and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again one of the few negative points i can think of for this series are that the main character and the merle can be a little annoying at times especially toward the beginning of the series but by the end of the series i do n't think there was a single character that i did n't love i also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode mystic eyes '' it does n't go with the whole theme of the series and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears believe it or not for all its glorious ideas and execution this show also has no filler ! originally it was to be a 36 episode show like macross so when it was cut down to 26 episodes the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that 's told and ultimately it 's the story that matters most as i watched this show for the first time i found myself addicted to its world in love with its characters awestruck with it 's beauty and enraptured with its music the ideas though were what made me decide this is the greatest tv show i have ever seen in this show you will see fate altered armies nuked people who are half animal creatures that can and even an incredible sequence where hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm when i had finished escaflowne my mind was full of questions what if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means and what of the escaflowne guymelef why was it built just how powerful could it ultimately become to this day i am fascinated by the transformation that van goes through and i keep asking myself if the escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil maybe someday i 'll know until then i 'll have to satisfy myself with escaflowne
yours at a tremendous bargain price tag all 26 episodes of the excellent vision of escaflowne saga in english and japanese on 8 dvds ! the discs are packaged in two keepcases held together by a cardboard slipcover special features include music videos playstation game footage and a six part series of interviews with some of the voice actors and creators of the show entitled club escaflowne '' this set does not include 'escaflowne the movie ' or the soundtrack cd escaflowne is without a doubt one of the best anime epics ever produced so do n't miss out on this incredible deal ! your destiny awaits
very rarely in my life have i come across a movie that makes me cry all you would have to do is watch the last 10 minutes of this movie to understand what i 'm saying however you should see the entire movie what perfection it has comedy drama and great acting on all parts tyrone power my favorite actor gives a grade a performance never will you find him as loveable or as dignified than as martin maher i find it hard to believe that john ford the director originally wanted john wayne for this movie not to nock wayne but power can convey sensitivity better as a side note john wayne 's son patrick appears in the movie maureen o'hara lovely as ever gets back to her irish roots in this film and it makes for a characterisation from the queen of technicolor it is n't any wonder john ford loved her as an actress she 's one of the best the movie spans 50 years at west point military academy and the life of martin maher and the people 's lives he touched it is a great american story definitely worth every bit of the two hours and seventeen minute running time i love this movie and if you read this you really should be watching the movie seriously it made me cry ! !
i first saw this movie at our local in the late here in the the memory of marty maher never looking through amazon one evening i noticed it was available well done it arrived in 6 days some things you order locally take longer than all these years since i last saw it still a great movie and still brings a tear to the eye tyrone power was perfect sadly nearing the end of his life as marty maher nothing against john wayne who i understand was the first choice but this his part maureen o hara is wonderful ward bond as that blackhearted master of the sword '' as marty calls him and donald crisp as marty snr its a long movie covering 50 years but never you loose interest its perfect john ford wanted to be remembered as the man who made westerns well he made other great as well in my opinion this is an equal to the quiet man long gray line the best ford without john wayne
this is a good old fashioned film similar to the english film 'goodbye mr chips ' it has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour pathos passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings ! ! ! i defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited marr baby dies shortly after birth or when james 'red ' sandstrom comes to vist marty at christmas with his mother i just love the whole tone of the film the director has got the atmosphere just right a real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness i am pleased to say it is a film i can watch again and again even my husband normally quite reticent with such films was impressed that to me was praise indeed
highly enjoyable tale of the life of marty maher the irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become west point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years despite personal tragedies and through two world wars maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished army officers ' academy including future legends like omar bradley and dwight eisenhower tyrone power is excellent and compelling as he portrays maher from young idealist to elderly sage irish accent intact all the way the scenery and west point pageantry is fun to watch although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the military academy interestingly there 's not really all that much football in this film there 's a little but it 's mainly the story of maher and his family and the young men he came to love like his own sons with the maureen o'hara as maher 's irish wife mary giving a radiant performance sentimental in that way of course but the legendary director john ford working with a cast made up of many of his favorites always puts a bite behind the sweetness
pixar has proven its animation metal a few times finding nemo and the incredibles are their most notable achievements pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great voices but the one thing that animation studios including pixar have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation many times they look plastic or stilted the incredibles avoided this by harkening back to ' but applying new styles finding nemo did n't have many human faces so it was n't such a hurdle with cars pixar did something very wise they did n't show a single human face personalities were under the hood so to speak of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity the story follows a cocky race car named lightning mcqueen owen wilson wedding crashers who 's triple tie win forces a showdown in california where the three winners will face off chick hicks michael keaton first daughter and the king racing icon richard petty are the other two contestants and they make it to california without any problems they are ready to win the piston cup '' but lightning 's driver mack john ratzenberger cheers tv series falls asleep on the road and lightning slides out the back also while asleep while on the highway '' lightning soon wakes up and tries to find mack but stumbles upon a town along abandoned route 66 called radiator springs unfortunately lightning also tears up the town 's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city stuck without any resources lightning grudgingly does the job but not before learning to slow his rpm 's and smell the proverbial roses he meets up with radiator spring 's city attorney sally carrera bonnie hunt monsters a sexy little porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to there 's also doc hudson paul newman the sting the town 's who harbors a big secret ramone cheech marin tin cup a owner luigi tony shalhoub galaxy quest a tire store proprietor with a love of italian cars and of course mater larry the cable guy the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it animation features by their very nature are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly but we 've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and cars does an admirable job of entertaining them too most kids probably wo n't know what is so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by mater and lightning but adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly that there are no human faces in cars also aided it immensely suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout
cars is an excellent pixar movie it 's a car version of thomas the tank engine with storyline references to doc hollywood but it 's easily the best pixar movie topping finding nemo the dvd has great special features such as an epilogue and the inspiration of cars i enjoy the animated short films one man band and mater and the ghostlight the folks at pixar have done it again brining in a great story great characters plenty of computer animated effects i especially am into vehicles
i collect all the pixar '' movies this one is exceptional
my son does too we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days and neither has gotten tired of it yet why we love it cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics the expressions and faces '' thay have and make and acting cause of the story it 's warm and fuzzy and funny SMILE cause of the way story is paced it never gets boring and slow but it does n't kill you with the tempo either cause its beautifully done not to say drawn cause we know it is n't just drawing any more the characters the details on them the city racetrack one of my favorites
i tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released not up to pixar standards i say it is most like a bugs life a good but not great film music did nothing for me where was the normal stand out musical score standard extras but no making of section i would have liked to have seen that something i hate about some dvd packages those horrible flip down openers yuck ! ! ! ! ! ! kids will enjoy nascar fans will enjoy fun but forgettable after you watch it
this is a great pixar movie this is my personal favorite pixar film it is extremely good graphics the director went on tracks to see how the track would look and asked real nascar narraters to do the narrating for the race scenes the plot is very good its about a car named lightning mc queen his life was racing and he was rude to people then he gets well you better find the rest out yourself the jokes are funny and the cast is so good this is a great movie for every one the bonus features are good to theres the bloopers but without the credits and then the inspiration for cars the sneak peaks are not to good though there is 5.1 sound and there scene selections are good there is allot so you can find where you left off i cant wait untill the 2 disc special edition comes out ! this is good movie for everyone from 5 to as old as you get so i recommend this movie cars you will have a long road ahead of you !
this is simply the cutest animated feature i have seen in years the characters are superb the art is fantastic the humor will catch young and old alike and i do mean young and old this is one cartoon that will be appreciated by those in their retirement years actually some of the puns will go right over the heads of the younger crowd the film had me laughing as much as i have laughed at anything for a l o n g time then just when i thought it was over a short follow up came after the credits then just when i thought that was over i discovered a couple of shorter animated bonus features and began laughing all over again i could find no faults i only have two suggestions 1. buy a copy for yourself 2. buy a copy as a gift for that special someone
according to me cars is the best the pixar studio has made toy story was the first the incredibles were but the cars are just simply the best ! i like the story i like the superb soundtrack and of course i love the animation it just made me feel that even cars have soul and feelings well maybe it wasnt a feeling but now i really believe that all the cars have feelings
i absolutely love this movie ! it 's one of my favorites and i could watch it over and over it 's got good plot good acting and great child stars i 'd recommend this movie to anyone to has n't seen it yet if there is any such person
this film is one of my all time favorites i think it 's because these kids remind me of my friends and i as kids riding our bikes going on little adventures etc the cast is absolutely perfect wil wheaton was the best crying kid of all time with the exception of ricky schroeder in the champ lol river phoenix was excellent in this film which is an adaptation of a stephen king short story part road film part coming of age tale all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings
this movie would have to be one of the most overrated film adaptations of any of stephen king 's books what you have are 4 losers who go in search of a dead body so that they can get onto the televison nightly news and become celebrities '' this shows you how sensitive these four kids are then to show their delicate sensibilities each one takes his turn at bawling his eyes out this movie stars the late river phoenix who was a very health conscious guy he did n't smoke or eat meat but he did like heroin which led to his demise sadly both stephen king and the director of this trash rob reiner have confused the experience of adoloescent with a sensitivity training workshop '' and by the way how come everybody in the audience expels blueberry pies did they all have the same thing for lunch as the guys in the pie eating contest i give this movie 5 stars because the oregon vistas are quite nice
when listening to rob reiner 's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to river phoenix one ca n't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80 's movie i was a late teenager when i saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when i was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff going camping riding bikes getting terrorized by older kids ! ! ! ! anyway i know i was n't around during the time period this is set but the basic themes are universal now i 'm not going to bore you with a recap of the story you can read that in another review let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances even jerry o'connell whose first film this is and of course kiefer sutherland is wonderfully menacing ! ! no wonder he was a vampire in lost boys the next year ! i 'm not sure the steady stream of profanity was necessary but then again i was n't around during the 50 's so maybe that was par for the course as someone elswhere mentioned this is an adults kid movie the dvd extras are fine it 's great to see the cast and director and stephen king remark on the making of the film knowing this was king 's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting so relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again especially if your an old timer like me you know all of 40 years old and if you have n't seen it before well let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it ! ! ! see ya ! !
this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices he hit the time the place and the kids perfectly this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday its a great movie and i 'd recommend it to anyone you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which is n't as bad as it sounds plus great and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950 's over this era
this is one of the greatest movies ever filmed in oregon and i would like to take this opportunity to say that dillon obviously needs to chill and use some vinegar based cleanser down south and does n't know his heinie from a hole in the ground
setting theme s castlerock smallville summer friends ' adventure life 's lessons solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown this 1986 instant classic of rob reiner 's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film the musical score is dramatic it sets the tempo from start to finish and it never misses a beat each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie 's unfolding and you do n't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding the lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient lazy summer days of grandeur to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity one can in stand by me favorably assume to watch pie eating contests leeches trains train dodging mail ball fancy cars fancy footwork verno 's beloved comb 's freefall cantenes thought they disappeared ben franklin 's outlets junkyard dog chases and much much more the ending is the real gravy the narration is superb also by far one of the favorite films of my youth believe john cusack can be seen playing the role of gordy 's football star elder brother stand by me is the childhood that big city life just does n't afford at least not anymore everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses rustic destination spots like the ones presented in this movie are still out there folks with a smidgen of ambition toward adventure which will take your there the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors five stars for reiners finest photoplay
this is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen before the concepts and possibilities it presents are life altering the presentation is entertaining educational and enlightening not to be missed by any person who considers themselves to be progressive or five stars
i found this to be an inspiring thoughtful and extremely interesting take at the new paradigm of science quantum mechanics this movie explains in terms the philosophical ramifications of the theory almost universally accepted and how it is relevant to our everyday lives even in it are interviews of many well credentialed and credible physicists philosophers and theologians making it engaging for even the most cynical of viewers interspersed is a drama showing the theories in action for a regular person for me it helps to reconcile spirituality christian in my case and scientific theory whereas before i always felt my love of science and reason were in constant conflict with my spiritual beliefs no longer ! watch the movie which is for the most part not dogmatic and not judgmental but instead and logically satisfying even for the religious '' i love it
i had previously bought the version liked it very much so i was eagerly looking forward to this latest version happy to know that this version has more new science related information which was what i was interested in and for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist there is a seperate section entirely on interviews the best part is that they have the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations for those who have not seen the version i think it is alright to watch this viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie the interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world universe and what they are made of if you had deep question about the reality you might find an answer in this movie ravi singapor
if you loved what the bleep do we know '' you will love what the bleep down the rabbit hole '' all your favorite academic types appear with more indept talk about quantum theory the expansiveness of the mind and the capacity of creating our own reality plus the challenge of otherness parallel universes is the dose of what is possible i welcome i watch either dvd at least monthly the description of addiction and how this traps us is another lecture i welcome the capacity to see life as what i shape it what i bring to the experience from a consciousness in expanded reality what i can create is thrilling and i feel this possibility after viewing either dvd the only draw back in down the rabbit hole '' is the story line with marlee matlin i would have enjoyed watching that develop and move into the future instead of rehashing the bleep 's '' story this is why i gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars
this film will change the way you perceive the natural '' world it 's very well done and brings very complicated concepts to light in a simple and comprehensive way truly it 's one of the best films i 've ever seen
its a great movie it really challenges one to look beyond what if
this film allows you to explore places in your heart and mind that you never knew existed this film is for all those who have questions it offers ideas and encourages the viewer to seek own answers although a documentary the film captures the eyes and sucks you in professional commentary is done with taste and is integral to the goal of the film i recommend this film to anyone who wonders what is truely reality and what is this life all about ''
simply fantastic ! anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children
this dvd is explaining things better than the previous version where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained the on water meditated upon by the japanese monk was especially awesome they have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western modern science ofcourse ends in letting you ponder have left most of it there there after one has to go into religion and spirituality particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the sanathana dharma '' teachings
this dvd has excellent workout segments you can do as much or as little as you want and if you do all 5 portions of cardio upper and lower body abs and stretch you get a great workout good for both beginners and those at a more advanced level
i really like the flexibility of this dvd workout the exercises are great it is definitely worth the mone
i was rating anther product and realized i had never rated this one denise austin does a great job here yes she is very enthusiastic and it can be a little much but she gets me through the workout every time i absolutely love the multiple options this dvd will grow with you as you get in shape she gives alternate moves within the workouts and that coupled with the ability to pick the intensity is just great i love that the workouts are short and when combined together you get to focus on the areas where you need the most work when i first started i just did one workout and as i felt better i added to it this is my absolute favorite workout vide
i love this dvd it 's very easy to use and you can what workout you want to do depending on your time constraints your own physical needs and level 1 20 minute cardio workout i 'm doing the low intensity a high intensity is also available cardio and i find it very enjoyable to do i love all the workouts in this segment those which include the grapevine shuffle lunges rainbow and almost all the movements even my old daughter loves them so she imitates me while watching me workout i went through the high intensity and for me the low intensity is a lot more fun 2 10 minute upper body i 'm also doing the low intensity but dvd has medium high too but instead of the chair i use the stability ball when i 'm doing the weights i find it 's more flexible to do it with a ball than on a chair 3 10 minute lower body i do n't consider my lower body a main problem spot so for now i skip this section due to time constraints that 's why this dvd is so good you can choose what you want depending on your needs ! this is also available in low medium and high intensity i went through the section though and find variety of lower body exercises which i have n't seen some yet i have to try this when i have the luxury of time SMILE 4 10 minute abs this is my problem spot so i always make it a point to do this all the time this is tough and you would really feel it working in all sections of your abs there are a lot of variation in the basic crunches which i find very useful i hope it works visibly though ! i have a lot of flab hiding my lol ! 5. the last segment is the stretching which is basically the usual stretching we see but of course very important in the cool down all in all i give this dvd a stars for being easy to use and the workouts being doable but effective i guess i 'm fast becomming a denise fan i enjoy her workouts and for me her talkies are not distracting but if you get annoyed with her voice there 's also a function to play music only buy this it is worth it
this is a great workout for me i just had a baby and need to tone up again but i do n't have a lot of time so this is perfect i can usually get in 2 10 min workouts in the morning while the baby sleeps or is having quiet time i have n't worked out in many months so it 's great to be able to start at beginner ! i am sore after the workouts so i think thye are pretty effective looking forward to seeing some results i just started 3 days ago !
i ordered this dvd with high expectations after reading all the reviews ! i 've got to tell you it met all of them you can choose an all low level moderate level or high intensity workout which includes abs and full body stretch or you can truly customize your workout the dvd lets you preset what level you want for every specific workout before you even start so that there are n't any interruptions between the chapters i almost hate to admit it but i choose the low intensity workout starting out i was sweating more than what i thought i would i even still found some of the abs and thigh exercises challenging ! ! i think that denise is extrememly motivational and can really help you keep up your momentum i know many times i would remember to tighten my abs while exercising with her catch phrase zip up those abs ! ! '' would recommend this to everyone at any fitness level because this is a workout that than grow '' with up as you become more fit ! 5 stars from me !
i was very impressed with this dvd and liked the flexibilty of picking and choosing your workout it gives you many options for your workout which is a nice change from the basic workout programs i have been a denise fan for many years and really enjoy her vast and varied collection of exercise yoga etc i recommend this program highly linda snyde
denise austin 's training system is easy to understand and to follow the training system is nice because you can select individual workouts or can choose a routine geared for the beginner intermediate or advanced exerciser i use the advanced level which incorporates hand weights into the 20 minute aerobics routine similar to a circuit workout with the exception of the abs portion of the dvd all exercise sections keep you moving to provide additional aerobic benefits i own several denise austin dvds and this is one of my favorite i highly recommend it !
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts i thought yeah right '' but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio it is up to you or you can choose from the basic low medium or high intesity workouts this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part i 'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
this is probably my favorite denise dvd it is super easy to set up a workout that i want if i do n't have a lot of time i just do strentgh training which has three levels easy or hard each lasts 10 minutes it also has two 20 minute workouts easy and hard and a kickbutt 10 minute ab workout the dvd allows you to program whatever workouts you 'd like i started seeing results as far as toned up muscles in two weeks
this was a gift purchase i do know she loves the movie and watches it over and over !
strictly ballroom is a wonderfully campy film that i can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the time heck i may have already seen it more times than that ! as i did the first i 'm not into dancing but this movie has such fun with it that i am considering it as a new interest however do not be mistaken about the film 's real intent it is an excellent piece of satire that has relevance to all aspects of life by the way i am a man who loves john wayne and clint eastwood westerns strictly ballroom may have a title that seems to peg it as a chick flick '' and indeed women will love it but it 's good fun for everyone
ai n't it the truth ! if you have n't seen this movie yet you are so lucky because you get to see it for the first time terrific plot actors dancing villains boo hiss and one of the sexiest men on the planet antonio vargas swoon this is n't a film for most people but i 've probably said as they said in 'strictly ballroom ' 'a life lived in fear is a life ' '' a hundred times sometimes laughing and sometimes crying good and useful and true words
when i 'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should the temperature is near 100 and the casualties from the war in iraq now have reached over the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else strictly ballroom is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile set in australia and directed by baz luhrmann it 's all about winning the pan pacific grand prix ballroom dancing competition besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors paul mercurio and tara morice the story is one that most of us want to believe that in the end after all that 's what happens in romantic comedies boy gets girl ugly duckling becomes suave swan the older generation get a chance to try things again or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children and good triumphs over the cynical bad guys in addition to the fine performances by mercurio and morice the other actors are quite wonderful particularly the hasting parents golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound as does delicious humor leave it to the aussies to do everything right in a movie
australian humor and quirky romantic comedy strictly ballroom is a gem from down under when paul hastings loses his partner because of new moves on the dancefloor he gets the ugly duckling fran who is as gutsy as he is both are brave enough to compete in the pan pacific competition with their new moves and all
what a kooky lovable sometimes just much too silly movie i absolutely love it it is one of my favorite movies of all times in fact after seeing it i immediately began learning salsa i 'll pass on the pasa doble thanks though scott '' is supposed to be the focus of the film fran '' steals the show after she washes her face and puts on something nice in fact she and scott 's father both rather pathetic characters steal the show wonderful ! wonderful ! wonderful ! i think i 'll put the dvd in right now !
brilliant movie the likes of monsoon wedding many little dramas inside the big picture very appealing to see more than once to pick up on all the detail very real people very interesting to see the likes of whom you know in your own community in aussie setting heaven forbid that someone gets it in their minds to do a remake on this one the charm is in the 'tatty ' old fashioned glit
when i first watched this movie i sat there and wondered 'what the hell is this all about ' i sat there and wondered if the cast was on acid then i went away and for the oddest of reasons it kept on coming back into my mind so i bought the dvd and watched it again it 's one of those movies that the more you watch the more enjoyable it becomes and the more you can appreciate it there is a plot of which to speak of though it 's stock standard and waterthin but the plot is incidental to the music dancing and pacing it certainly goes down in my top 10 favourite movies
a movie to enjoy watching many times very entertaining and light
simply wonderful movie ! combination of carmen '' the flamenco film not the opera and if you have never seen that well do and the cutting edge '' with lots of hysterical satire thrown in male lead not bad to watch and a very good dancer his partner was not so skilled they were sort 've like torvil and dean of olympics fame on the dance floor this film won the australian oscar rather formulaic plot the dancing is the thing here
the first two episodes of volume 5 are a little bit uncharacteristic of the usual ghost in the shell emotional range in episode 17 the major travels to taiwan in search of more info about kuze but instead surrenders to her maternal instincts by stepping in between a teenage boy and a local gang war the next episode features batou as the main star as he and the major are taken away from the kuze case to help an international effort succeed in nailing an infamous terrorist bomber batou begins to become attached to a young handicapped girl who mysteriously seems to be looking right at him even when he 's in camouflage mode which should render him invisible to the naked eye even though kuze was a member of the individual eleven which wanted to drive all refugees out of japan it seems he 's switched sides now and is the main driving force of the rapidly escalating insurrection of the refugees when section 9 gets wind that kuze wants to get his hands on atomic weapons the stakes get dramatically higher ! this series gets better and better even outshining the first season since gig is dealing with an issue that is really upfront and center in the us right now if you 've made it this far then you 'll know just how amazing the writing is on this show even after all the years spent with these characters you can still find nuances in their reactions and be charmed that no matter how mechanized their bodies become their ghost '' still remains and makes them human even the major whose body is full prosthetic ! the art and animation is the best i 've ever seen in a tv anime and you have to marvel at how they pulled off the budget to make it classic stuff extras interviews with japanese voice actors who play motoko batou togusa borma and the director kenji kamiyama
i 'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 dvds ago and it continues with this volume as for the episodes themselves they were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs everything comes to a head and resolves looking back on the four episodes the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in japan this was not enough for a point deduction at the end of the day anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons you will not be disappointed
long awaited ! as a big er fan i was was glad to finally get this season ! i wish they would come out them faster
season five was a season of comings and goings in the venerable thursday night nbc drama despite the second major cast member checking out in two years the show continued to be strong and the foundations of one relationship that would continue on for a number of years was set in place at the end of season five mark greene anthony edwards and doug ross george clooney have n't always agreed on the way they practice medicine or how to deal with authorities but they are both great doctors and despite their differences are also pretty good friends season five sees greene trying to walk the fine line of friend and manager as he copes to deal with ross ' basic disregard for authority the pediatrician finally goes over the line with one terminally sick boy breaking every protocal which eventually leads to his departure from the cook county general emergency department clooney was quickly becoming a big star on the big screen and a burgeoning movie career was pulling him away from his weekly television series so when the time came to go he left this was a pretty big blow to the cast the second original member to leave in two years sherry stringfield 's susan lewis left in season three but as has been the case the show continued on with great additions to the cast to take the place of clooney before he left though clooney fought for and got a pediatric er approved with himself as the attending his relationship with nurse carol hathaway julianna margulies continued to grow stronger as the two planned their future together as the season drew to a close hathaway discovered she was pregnant with his twins but when she told him the news he could n't return leaving her to face the pregnancy alone greene got a good dose of being a manager as he and kerry weaver laura innes managed to work the er through a number of problems greene also dealt with his wife being remarried and his daughter having to live far away he does get to spend some time with her early in the season he also treats a hospital janitor guest star djimon hounsou with a horrible history of abuse and helps him to overcome his fears and confront everything going on in his life greene also strikes up a friendship with british surgeon elizabeth corday alex kingston and as the season ends they begin a relationship that would eventually lead to their marriage corday begins her second year in chicago starting over as an intern when she turns down romano 's guest star and future regular paul mccrane advances he cancels her fellowship and she is forced to start over again her relationship with peter benton eriq lasalle eventually ends and as the year comes to a close in addition to her relationship with greene she is going back to romano looking for another fellowship to extend her stay in chicago weaver begins a search for her birth mother a search that leads her to someone who is n't her mother thanks to a private investigator she applies for the job as head of the er but is passed over in favor of amanda lee guest star mare winningham who turns out to actually not be a doctor at all after the lee fiasco weaver does n't put her name back in an the temporary reins are turned over to romano much to the disdain of the entire er staff pa jeannie boulet already positive for hiv comes down with hepatitis c and is also involved in a car accident with ross which puts her in the hospital for a while she also is a key part of the pediatric er with ross hathaway as mentioned continues to grow in her relationship with ross she also opens a clinic in the er catering to the poor of the area her clinic is a great success until she is forced to step down after ross uses her and the clinic to get the machine that ultimately kills his final patient the season ends as she begins what will be one of her finest arcs on the show her pregnancy with twins the storyline is also one that will eventually introduce viewers to abby lockhart maura tierney who is now a regular on the show benton continues to deal with his son 's deafness going to great lengths to learn all he can he is hurt when he learns that his son 's mother is moving to germany with her new husband and basically kidnaps his son in the season 's final episode benton also had a highlight '' episode in the season as he journeyed to mississippi to fill in at a doctor 's office there and had to deal with the racial tensions and also had to find his bedside manner as he stepped away from being a surgeon for two weeks john carter noah wyle had an interesting year he began the year as an ra in the medical students ' dorm but lost his job when the students threw a party that resulted in an overdose he eventually moved into weaver 's basement he also has a relationship with insurance saleswoman roxanne guest star julie bowen but breaks that off in the final few episodes of the season his tryst with his medical student lucy knight the kellie martin is a highlight of the season although it only happened in one episode knight is the new kid on the block in this season the eager medical student with a good brain but a lack of actual skills she and carter seem to have a relationship that comes to full tilt when she accidently kicks him in the chest and helps nurse him back to health the highlight of this season was the episode the storm '' possibly the best episode the show has ever done in the episode jeannie and doug get in a car accident on the way to help at a horrific accident involving a school bus where greene is a hero for saving the kids additionally carter and knight have their tryst in one of the hospital 's rooms and eventually ross calls it quits the two hours were filled with great drama and it is truly a highlight in er 's run the only thing lacking on this set is extras there are a lot of deleted scenes and a great gag reel but no commentaries or other extras that is a little disappointing i enjoy getting whatever access i can to my absolute favorite television show and this set does n't provide anything substantial to that regard despite that this was a great season truly one of the best they did the cast was able to move past clooney 's departure and pull together in the final few episodes all in all a fine effort for one of television 's best dramas
it 's a good season worth owning i assume you already know this if you are reading this the dvd set is presented with good sound picture quality etc i was really disappointed to see that warner cheaped out on the english subtitles this time around seasons were awesome to watch with the subtitles for the hard of hearing as it really helped with the comprehension of all the medical jargon that was being spewed out at 100 miles an hour as a medical professional myself i got a lot out of this special '' feature my fiancee who is not a medical professional found that she was able to get a lot more out of the show by watching the subtitles as well it definitely helps a viewer appreciate the complexity of the show 's writing the show is still great however it is inexplicable why we had to wait 7 months for this dvd set to come out when they obviously did n't put as much work into it as the previous sets ie they did n't want to pay someone to transcribe the scripts and sync subtitles this is especially irksome considering that season 5 has been available on dvd in the uk for quite a long while now i had just assumed warner was spending the extra time and cash to do the job right for north america i was wrong
while the first four seasons of er were superb season 5 takes it up a notch this is mostly due to the addition of possibley the greatest er character ever lucy knight the relationship between her and carter has been the best almost coupling in the shows history the departure of doug ross was devastating and emotional the rest of the cast were terrific as well greene benton corday even romano gave amazing performances every time it 's just a shame that not every season can be as memorable as season 5 was the dvd should be great i 'll be first in line to buy it
i ask again why is it that the series is filmed in the us produced in the us etc and yet the uk is already selling series 6 which was released in april 2006. season 5 was realeased last year you all say you are so excited that the season is about to be released where those fans in the uk are feeling sorry for you because they are ahead yet again i suggest buying a dvd player and buy the seasons from else where aroung the world as they seem to be more with it and
finally season 5 is here i have been checking here like every week waiting on this season to come out i have never watched er until my recent deployment to iraq i went through the first 4 seasons in like 2.5 months and i know if those were really good then season 5 is going to even better
it 's finally here ! the complete fifth season of er is coming to dvd ! season five is one of the most intense seasons of er period ! kellie martin joins the cast as carter 's med student lucy knight also doug ross georege clooney leaves the show in a riveting two parter jeanie 's condition worsens benton realizes his son is deaf and at the end of the season hathaway finds out she is carrying twins that is just the tip of the iceberg of what happens in er season 5 this is a must for any fan also i would like to correct a careless mistake made by the cast members they have listed at the top of the page are not in this season most of them did n't even come in until the ninth or tenth season the entire fifth season cast is anthony edwards george clooney noah wyle julianna margulies gloria rueben laura innes alex kingston kellie martin and eriq la salle as for the cast members listed at the top of the page here are the seasons they came in goran visnjic season 6 maura tierney season 6 mekhi phifer season 9 recurring previously in season 8 parminder nagra season 10 linda cardellini season 10 there have been many other cast members on the show since season five but these are the ones mistakenly listed by amazon as being on the fifth season this season won at least one emmy if not more and earned even more nominations including one for noah wyle patient story lines include an a man who has strapped a bomb to himself a girl who needs a transfusion of a rare blood type a man dressed as an elf who has a heart arrythmia a school bus accident a shot stripper and a dui victim this set also includes the emmy winning two parter the storm which is the departure of george clooney 's charachter it was watched by over 40 million people when it first aired this is one of er 's best seasons although i have to say they are all great except for the eleventh season oh well at least it got back to being good again for the twelth season keep em coming warner brothers !
kathy ireland gives you a quick warm up 12 minutes of abs 12 minutes of buttocks and 12 minutes of thigh work there 's a countdown clock for each workout during each workout kathy has you switch exercises every 45 seconds which i think is great no annoying and you can focus on working it hard and getting the burn because you know it will be over soon ! most of the ab work is based on the traditional crunch but kathy uses enough variations to keep it fun and deady effective i 'm feeling this one days later the buns work involves some squats some stuff and a little floorwork and it 's pretty effective too though as always you get out of it what you put into it the greatest aspect of the video for me though is the congenial atmosphere kathy seems so sweet and her workout crew two guys a girl and kathy 's mom are nice companions for the workout the guys will keep you giggling they keep saying goofy stuff like this one hurts '' or i 'm gon na eat a big steak tonight '' kathy is a good and motivator and she has a nice way of gracefully humoring those goofy guys in this aspect it 's the most fun i 've ever had while doing a workout video it captures the positive social aspects of working out in a class setting but you get all the convenience and privacy of working out at home the vhs version is called kathy ireland body specifics this dvd has the same workouts but it sure is nice to just select the workout you want from the menu instead of fast forwarding and rewinding all the time
this time i was pleasantly surprised love the short sections as i get bored very easily ca n't believe how quickly the thigh section went when i did it either ! ! ! kathy ireland seems like a really sweet girl and her body is certainly an inspiration to me as i huff and puff on the floor i will be buying more thanks kathy it 's so lovely to find a dvd that i feel like i can work through without getting lost
i had two of the three sections on vhs now i own them on dvd and i love to exercise the target areas in less time i am a full time student and mother of three so exercising is at a minimum
the funniest show ever enough said
arrested development 's rocky history is well known loved by critics and its fans it fought to find an audience and its final season was a short affair however the ride from the shows premier included uncensored and expanded along with the aired version to its conclusion and yes it has a conclusion is hilarious and worth many returns there are so many jokes and resonating gags that multiple viewings are required but your first visit to the world of the spoiled buth family will be a reward for unfamiliar viewers here are three seasons of laughs the series begins with the arrest of the bluth patriarch and continues as the clan 's only responsible memeber michael portrayed by jason bateman tries to keep the family 's business afloat while his mother siblings and other family members selfishly grab for every freebie and dollar his mother lucille is a cold controlling alcoholic whose loyalty to her family keeps her one step from pure villainy his siblings include an older brother gob a magician of little skill a younger brother buster a mama 's boy who eventually loses a body part to a nasty seal and a sister whose marriage is complicated throw in a son infatuated with his cousin and an uncle who is the twin of his father and you can see how complicated michael 's life becomes not your average family not your average tv comedy this is not a sitcom performed live in front of a studio audience but is filmed more like a documentary with the camera floating around like an unseen voyeur think the old comedy series soap updated a la the office the jokes come fast and furious it 's all absurd and incredibly entertaining for the record the series is presented widescreen and there are deleted scenes and audio commentaries for selected episodes to tell you the truth i have n't even skimmed these extras but i have watched the series in its entirety far too many times to disclose without embarrassing myself it 's too bad that arrested development did n't achieve the ratings necessary to keep it afloat but it has more laughs than comedies that lasted twice as long
this 3 disc box set by criterion contains three of jean renoir 's color films made in the 1950 's the first film is the golden coach '' known in france as le carrousee d'or '' it is the story of spanish colonists in central america the film is intended as a comedy and contains some fine scenes it is very well written and the vivaldi score is great also the film is in english which is rare for french films the second film is french cancan '' which was previously released in the us as only the french can '' it depicts the grand opening of the world famous french nightclub moulin rouge the film has great acting and appearencec by some famous performers including the great french singer edith piaf as anyone could expect the film contains offenbach 's orpheus in the underworld '' in the score and an excellent finale scene of women dancing the cancan i think that the film is one of finest examples of french cinema depicting the performing arts the third film elena and her men '' known in france as elna et les hommes '' is the story of a princess from poland who is very attractive to the men around her some of the elite class begin to fight over her resulting in the instability of french society the film has an excellent performance by ingrid bergman as the princess and has some fine scenery each disc includes special features some of which are very good disc 1 contains the golden coach '' with seperate introductions to the film by jean renoir and martin scorsesse production stills and the first part of a three part interview with jean renoir originally set for french television disc 2 contains french cancan '' with an introduction by peter bogdanovich the part of the afforementioned 3 part interview production stills and an interview with set designer max douy disc 3 contains elena and her men '' along with an introduction by renior production stills the part of the interview and the second half of a 1990 's british tv documentary on renior this box set is a very fine collection of renoir 's films and a must buy for renoir fans
the three color films that mark jean renoir 's return to europe might be surprising compared to his classics 30 's films like rules of the game la bete humaine toni or grand illusion with which renoir became prominent as a master of realism for instance always preferring to shoot on location rather than in studio environments toni was one of the first major sound motion picture to be entrely shot on location with direct sound recording a revolution at the time the golden coach french cancan and elena and her men are deliberately artificial stylized and burlesque note for instance the framings in the golden coach in which claude renoir 's camera is consciously and carefully placed to achieve symmetrical compositions in comparison to the moving camera techniques of grand illusion and rules of the game that allowed him to capture the actions without missing the many crucial details in one continuous long take these three films especially coach and elena may look very static the acting style is also very much over the top one of the supplements the jacques rivette 's interview in which renoir repeatingly insists that truth '' or reality '' can be only achieved through artifice and artifacts of the artistic medium is extremely revealing about renoir 's changing his style and that though the apparent style has changed his philosophy about filmmaking is remarkably consistent these three films are also created as comedies though the contents are some of the most serious themes treated in cinema and have a lot to do with cinema itself as a art form for each of the three films is profound analysis about performing in human life french cancan is about the nature of performers and the difficulties of that profession the golden coach and elena and her men are among other things political farces based on the extremely cynical idea that politics are nothing else but a matter of performance arguably only renoir could depict those themes as comedies some notes should be made on the transfers of this new dvd edition elena was shot with eastmancolor film stock one strip negative and the transfer is created from the original negative excepts for segments dissolves and fade outs fade ins which show severe color fading the dvd represents very much what the film should look like and those color fadings are practically impossible to fix with today 's technology the golden coach and french cancan were originally shot with technicolor cameras this system requires 3 negatives running simultaneously each of them recording one primary color so it is impossible to just scan the original negatives to get the most faithful images the dvd transfers for these 2 films are created from interpositives for french cancan it seems that a vintage print was used and though it shows certain damages caused by age the dvd represents faithfully the texture and details such as the material quality of the clothings that can be only captured on a technicolor print as well as the rather pale color palette that renoir and art director max douy intended to depict the period the story takes place in the heights of impressionism paintings for the golden coach the print used for the transfer is probably from the restoration and in the early 90 's martin scorsese financed the american distribution hence his introduction on the dvd this restoration was important since before that the film was virtually invisible but nevertheless not a perfect one technically speaking it does not have the richness of color of a technicolor prints particularly the reds and the blacks suffer a lot plus certain shots especially the extremely moving and revealing epilogue in which renoir confesses through magnani the sadness of working in performing arts suffer a lot from the different shrinkage of each negatives the colors are nearly dead and they look out of focus it 's a pity that unlike the american studio 's technicolor classics with which a lot of financial and technical efforts are constantly made to put them back into shape the golden coach one of the greatest masterpieces of this is not yet properly restored criterion has already put grand illusion and rules of the game on market with beautiful dvd editions now watching this new dvd sets and especially watching the supplement bbc documentary about renoir 's career after the 40 's i must say that now they have to publish renoir 's first color film the river which is one of the masterpiece of renoir 's as well as a key film for the evolution of his style on a dvd edition as accomplished as these
french cancan renoir 's theme is love in all its frightening vibrancy and i still sit amazed as i watch the first 45 minutes of this film as the film 's great leitmotives desire and jealousy wash like waves one after the other through the characters and through my own limbs renoir shows us love the force of nature that will not be contained gathering strength and finally erupting through the story like a hurricane overwhelming all who wish to control it and leaving in its path destruction and pain but also creation beauty joy and life in spirit french cancan is most like jean 's memoir of his father and one feels oneself in the presence of auguste here more than in any other of jean 's films elena et les hommes politics as show business made at the time that jean was producing and writing plays for the theatre these three films all have in common a preoccupation with the theatrical nature of life shakespeare 's insight that all the world is a stage receives fresh treatment in elena et les hommes as the film contemplates the theatrical nature of politics and worldly ambition politics is just another kind of show business renoir is telling us the film usually disconcerts viewers with its mixture of theatrical styles ingrid bergman fresh off five films with rossellini leads an excellent cast of actors that play in a naturalistic style while the setting and the supporting cast are pure burlesque this interplay of styles perhaps more at home in the theatre creates moments of compelling realism on the one hand against a background of farce on the other perhaps also frustrating to viewers is the way that the film refuses to become a conventional love story despite the presence of established romantic leads gorgeous costumes and sets technicolor and a beautiful score rather than go to hollywood for character types renoir appears to have gone to ancient greece each of the men pursuing elena recalls plato 's anecdote about the three types of men who go to the olympic games some go to compete for fame some go to sell and make money and others of a more philosophical nature go to observe the film also contains several nods to rossellini 's viaggio in italia including the way ingrid is carried along the street by joyful crowds the miraculous love the magician '' ending and the presence of an uncompromising realism that often violates standards of taste witness the scene after the parade which begins as a charming romantic encounter between ingrid and mel ferrer and then leads to a moment when ingrid having had too much to drink no longer knows what she is doing and ends up making out in a bar full of people with a man she has just met ingrid bergman of all people ! and here we see how with respect to an uncompromising realism and the limits imposed upon it by conventional standards of taste renoir rossellini and stroheim were all members of the same school despite varying surface appearances take a close look at the world keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you its ''
golden coach 1953 golden coach is the first film of a loosely put together trilogy with themes of love and life on the stage made by jean renoir this film is also a salutation to the french people as renoir returns to to france after having fled during world war ii and trying to make it in hollywood however renoir had much difficulty dealing with influential movie producers in hollywood as they often kept renoir under strict supervision this supervision made renoir feel somewhat strangled when it cames to artistic freedom which is also expressed in this trilogy the golden coach takes place in century peru where the spanish viceroy of peru has purchased a golden coach from italy in order to symbolically display the might of the colony a small italian theater troupe trails the golden coach as they voyage on the same ship across the atlantic to the new world when the theater troupe arrives to the town where they have been promised a job with several luxuries they find a pitiful small town with no commodities as promised in the employment letter deprived of hope they begin to build a small stage where they can perform and maybe earn enough to return to europe the theater troupes unspoken star is camilla anna magnani whom most men find delicately alluring as her mere presence absorbs all the attention from the audience as she flourish on the stage camilla 's charisma attracts three prominent men 's attention as all three fall in love with her the protective spanish soldier felipe paul campbell traveled with her across the atlantic as he tries to charm her and win her over the fiery and infamous toreador ramon riccardo rioli who has been spellbound by camilla 's stage performance tries to sway her into marriage lastly the spanish viceroy ferdinand duncan lamont is drawn to her as he finds himself being prepared to give up the golden coach to her felipe ramon and ferdinand find themselves in trouble as they are all attracted to camilla who never will belong to one of them as she loves the stage jean renoir hired a small italian family circus to perform in the film as the theater troupe the only film actor in the theater troupe is anna magnani who performs brilliantly as renoir entirely built the film around her the film becomes a tribute to italian theater as much of the film surrounds theater and the is symbolically a theater set however the strongest tribute to theater comes through camilla 's love for the stage and the audience 's love for her renoir was also influenced by vivaldi 's music which inspired the script 's italian zest which offers a terrific cinematic experience that is both witty warm and full of valuable lessons french cancan 1955 the second part of jean renoir trilogy about the love for the stage is a colorful story about the vaudeville manager henri danglard jean gabin and his rejuvenation of an old frolicsome dance called the cancan danglard is more of an artist than a manager as his ultimate goal is which he projects to the audience through the performances of a large number of artists these artist have all been discovered through danglard 's incredible instincts to find talent among ordinary people and turn them into celebrities over night the skillful danglard also loves the critical audience as he seeks their approval through a violent flow of applause the story begins in successful cafe le paravent chinois with vaudeville performances that heavily depend on lola de castro 's mara flix performance lola is also danglard 's mistress but what the audience does not know is that danglard spends every penny to improve the show in order to conquer the audience 's approval this leads le paravent chinois into bankruptcy but it does not bother danglard as he is aware of the existing financial potential in paris this means that danglard is in that he will find another sponsor for his new project which is the french cancan the quest for the french cancan becomes a difficult struggle as danglard must face jealous mistresses and boyfriends physical harm and much more however this does not prevent danglard to continue to strive to create his final masterpiece which will become the initiation of the moulin rouge jean renoir 's french cancan becomes a root for as he nose dives into his own artistic talent where he uses the cancan dance as an allegory for freedom and artistic originality the film also became a reunion between two cinematic titans gabin and renoir as they made some brilliant films together almost two decades ago gabin becomes renoir 's alter ego in this cinematic event as he displays renoir 's love for the arts through rejuvenation of the cancan it should be mentioned that gabin was personally offended by renoir 's escape to united states during world war ii and his delayed return to france after the war nonetheless these two men came together and created a brilliant cinematic experience that honors the arts and stage performances elena and her men 1956 elena and her men is the final film in renoir 's trilogy of stage performances this is a film with serious undertones loosely based on general georges boulanger 's attempt to reverse the popularity of the republic in france with his own popularity in the the history books reveal the truth of general georges boulanger 's failed coup as he was strongly supported by orleanist and bonapartist princes in this story general georges boulanger is renamed general rollan jean marais but the story is focused on the main character elena ingrid bergman the liberal polish princess elena seeks to change the world for the better by her standards by inspiring men to pursue their dreams and urge them to seek a higher calling in the initial scene it becomes apparent that elena has already succeeded once as a composer and has received an immense career boost through elena 's ' encouragement but the composer 's marriage proposal is declined by the elena elena 's independence and liberal mind is noticeable as she mingles on the crowded streets of paris as the people celebrate general rollan 's return from a successful campaign elena is strongly affected by the people 's cheers for general rollan as she begins to pursue a way to meet general rollan when they meet it is obvious that general rollan has strong affections for elena which will play a large part in the films outcome film viewers that have seen other films by jean renoir will easily detect the as it reproduces a staged atmosphere which produces theater atmosphere nonetheless it will not ruin the film as renoir tells an intelligent story with different plots and schemes as he also did in rules of the game 1939 which has several similarities with elena and her men these different plots are all told in a delicate satirical light as they convey a serious message that will offer much thought for the viewers that engage themselves in elena and her men criterion criterion does a stunningly skillful work to put these three films together in a box that symbolically matches the colors presented in the films any film enthusiast will recognize the good work done by the criterion company lastly the additional information on the dvds will further the cinematic education of the audience
i just saw french can can minutes ago and after seeing it i can honestly say purchasing the set was worth it orson welles was once asked to name his three favoite directors to which he responded john ford john ford and john ford after seing french can can i respond for myself jean renoir jean renoir and jean renoir i ca n't remember the last time i laughed so hard i loved a picture so much and cried so much and so hard well no that 's noy quite fair i can remember the last time i felt all those things it was after seing grand illusion by jean renoir ! it 's heartbreakingly beautiful
early this year criterion issued the definitive dvd of jean renoir 's 1939 classic the rules of the game '' now the label lightens up with stage and spectacle '' a boxed set that makes a trilogy out of the splashy technicolor films renoir made upon returning to europe in the renoir was in a mood to party he 'd survived an unhappy decade exiled in the hollywood studio system the director felt liberated much like his homeland france and so we have two bawdy celebrations of life and theater the golden coach '' starring life force anna magnani 1953 and french cancan '' a snappy and wise backstage comedy 1955 elena and her men '' 1956 exudes romance with ingrid bergman as a savvy and desirable polish princess toying with french politics plots are thin spirits are high all of the films are filled with boisterous dizzying crowd scenes the frames remind me of his father 's paintings '' martin scorsese says in an introduction to coach '' it 's like standing in the presence of a great fresco and being overwhelmed the use of color is extraordinary '' alas renoir 's palette has withered all of these restored films show their age witness the sustained flashing in coach '' abrupt shifts in color tone in elena '' and the oddly scenes in cancan '' but making allowances the visuals remain magnificent memorable the films are all full frame mono audio is bright and serviceable renoir who died in 1979 loved talking about his work clips of him are featured throughout the dvd set the filmmaker sits with new wave director jacques rivette for a subtitled interview a monologue really that 's spread across the three dvds it 's a terrific but lecture on the craft of filmmaking the bbc documentary on renoir 's career that began on the rules of the game '' dvd continues here covering mostly the director 's hollywood years under the thumb of darryl zanuck and other studio chiefs the making of the three joyous films found in this set serves as a happy ending of sorts
french cancan one of three renoir films packaged by criterion as stage and spectacle is a marvelous movie the story is simple but the execution is amazing a belle epoque impresario down on his financial luck is going to open a new club the moulin rouge with a new dance the french cancan he encounters a working girl and makes her a dancer she 'll become a star there are several crises to overcome before that happens the movie is jean renoir 's tribute to show business and he puts it on the screen with color verve humor and humanity there are wonderful performances by all the actors the leads are jean gabin as henri danglard the impresario francoise arnoul as nini the girl who 'll become a star and maria felix as lola de castro an overwhelmingly tempestuous beauty and danglard 's lover at the start gabin exudes confidence worldly humor and dedication to show business he even dances a bit arnoul is first rate too it looks like she was doing her own dances and as an actress think of a young leslie caron with brains and charm the climax of the movie is the opening of the club with felix 's star dance comic songs a whistler a singer all moving toward the introduction of the french cancan the crises happen and are resolved then the cancan explodes dancing girls come bursting out from the stage the front of the theater through posters down ropes from the balcony the house swirls with the black tie and tails of the swells and the garish colors of the dancers ' gowns the cancan number lasts probably ten or fifteen minutes or so all music and gaiety all high kicks and splits it 's amazing when row after row of the dancers moving toward the camera through the audience leap up legs extended straight foward and backward backs arched then land on the dance floor in full splits i did n't know whether to shout or wince the last scene of the movie is outside the club shot from the cobblestone street looking at the entrance it 's a medium shot and from the side street a happy inebriated fellow in black tie and top hat staggers across pauses to tip his hat at the camera then staggers off a completely charming ending this really is a marvelous movie peter bogdanovich has a good filmed interview he usually puts me off with the ego the ascot and the dyed hair but he does know movies and his insights into renoir and this movie are good there are several extras and the dvd transfer is first rate the golden coach what a charming movie i started smiling at the opening curtain and the good feeling lasted to the end the dialogue is often amusingly worldly with an epigrammatic style the look of the movie is so lush and theatrical and anna magnani is a powerhouse as camilla one critic said that watching one after the other of the golden coach french cancan and elena and her men the three movies in the criterion renoir pack would create a sensory overload he 's right i think but taking each at a leisurely pace is proving very rewarding the theater is life renoir says and he 's proving it in these three movies
pbs did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together it covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films the documentary includes many interview pieces with kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like also there are comments from noted japanese film historian donald richie as a kurosawa fan watching this on pbs when it aired the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour it is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century
i saw this on pbs ' great performances this documentary is about film genius akira kurosawa the documentary charts akira kurosawa 's early life in japan to the end of his life kurosawa brought japanese cinema to a world wide audience i recommend this dvd for anyone who is a akira kurosawa fan plus the dvd has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the pbs program and kurosawa filmography
putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that 's not what matters this film is amazing
a little cerebral and a little slapstick and all shakespeare it is how shakespeare would have written the story of hamlets friends
this is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something but those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most films of all time there is n't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the crowd but it has some of the best acting serious and comic writing imagery of any film you 're likely to come across
i have to admit this movie can be slow and strange hence minus 1 star but to me and this is just to me i was able to pay attention because of gary oldman who is my all time 1 favorite actor he 's such a chameleon and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way shape or form or is just eccentric or crazy lol he 's just brilliantly funny in this it 's interesting gary 's character as 'rosencrantz ' not guildenstern lol is a 'slow ' fella but he 's imaginative inventive but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you 're talking about then to top it all off you 're thrust into hamlet but from another perspective so you got ta get into the shakespearian linguo which i have n't done fully since grade and that was 6 years ago fortunately ros guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or as thickly as the other regular hamlet characters do it 's just worded strangely it 's like they 're poets the chemistry between roth oldman is wonderful and the extra 's are interviews with dreyfus oldman roth stoppard himself then they also have a photo gallery that 's it but for me it was enough to hear oldman talk for 58 minutes ! SMILE they 're interviewed separately the dvd i got came with 2 discs i suppose this is the only release to dvd so far so they all will be 2 disc quality was very good SMILE if you 're a big fan of gary 's i highly recommend this flick very amusing and interesting and good shakespearian fun
this is a work of genius it is creative original funny and well done that being said it is probably not for everyone this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare 's hamlet these are the stars of the show in hamlet they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet 's melancholia they appear briefly and are gone the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince in this work the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them as they discuss existential questions the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them it is quite funny but some background helps it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style it helps if you are familiar with hamlet that makes understanding the context easier it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn it 's is fun
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of shakespeares works it does help to have an idea of hamlet and i would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost it gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players rosencrantz and guildenstern however it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of hamlet
after taking several years off the cult hit tv show strangers with candy returns in all its glory most of the original crew are represented which was a feat unto itself the original tv show was maybe the funniest show ever the characters and dialogue are so well done and with little an almost underground following we have this last episode in the life and times of jerry blank this movie does not disappoint there are so many funny lines in this it does the show justice onyx blackman is back in trouble with his gambling addiction and needs to show the school board that he can produce intelligent students meanwhile jerry blank has just enrolled after a 32 year prison sentence to further complicate his goal science teacher turned religous chuck noblet is at his best in this one he must decide whether his new found religous beliefs are more important to him than his love for the flamboyant art teacher geoffrey jellineck so many great moments when chuck teaches his class eyes to the back of the room there is even a celebrity couple who play roles in this one if you have seen the original series then what are you waiting for and if you are new to this series you may want to watch some of the dvds from the original seasons to brush up on it a bit they add some background to some of the humor and jokes part of what makes a show so good in your mind is the fact that it ended before it should have and thats just what happened to strangers with candy this movie is for the true fans who got it and needed one more for the road
strangers with candy the movie is pretty funny in fact it is funnier than most major comedy releases but maybe not as funny as the tv series that spawned it problem is the same as for the movie rather than changing the game plan coneheads for the new arena they went with their usual formula that gets watered down on the big screen that being said in my worthless opinion amy sedaris is the funniest woman in the world and it was wonderful and wonderfully funny to see so many of the original members reunited one other problem may have been that on the series they would several shots to tell a joke and did n't have that liberty in the movie as it cost so much more another may have been with paul dinello directing the movie he shortchanged his role as jellineck still strangers will be hysterical for any ardent fan but not sure it 's the best introduction for a newcomer as strangers with candy like a fine wine is an acquired taste
out of prison unleashed on flatpoint once again for the first time a prequel to the best politically incorrect tv comedy perhaps ever at least besides all in the family laughs galore as jerri tries to adjust to life outside the harsh penal system it is not easy especially for everyone inside jerri 's chow zone '' you may take a beating or perhaps loose a finger but jerri is loyal to her bitches if anyone messes with her friends she 'll stick 'em with a shive in the showers violent slapstick vulgar sexual content and other delights await
hey i 'd just like to say that i 'm one of the kids in the video and its great to read all the good feedback on the video i 'm glad you guys like it because we put a lot of time and effort into making it crazylegs and robin are two of the best teachers in new york and it was great to have them collaborate on this video for the public thanks again
i got this video for my 5 yr old to begin to get some experience in party '' dancing the moves are very easy to follow she loves the video as does her younger 3 yr old sister they have watched it 5 or 6 times now and still love it while the oldest is not a master of the moves yet it is exactly what i was looking for it is a video that introduces her to some dance steps while encouraging her to create her own it allows her to have fun not sit in front of the tv and learn some dance moves at the same time i would expect that if she continues to watch the video that it would help her get some confidence and be able to dance although the video is not necessarily for 5 year olds she is able to try '' the moves and should be able to get them down after practicing i think this video has staying power '' they will use it for a few years i would recommend this for someone looking for a basic dance video it is good for 5 year olds on up to early teens my husband and i were even trying out some moves ! keep in mind it is hip hop not the waltz it is good for kids learning to dance with other kids and i agree with another reviewer i was pleased that it is not too racy for childen it is in quite good taste after they get the moves down i will try the hip hop shop 2
this got my old nephew up and dancing when another vid did n't decent instruction i thought was worried that it might be too for his dad 's taste but seemed fine happy with the purchase
we just got the dvd about a week ago and my kids love it ! my boys love videos and dancing and this was perfect for them they are 10 and 5 and both were able to do all the steps after the first 2 viewings my 2 year old daughter even gets up and does some of the easier moves with them ! ! ! fun easy and great exercise ! ! ! i 've done the tape with them and it 's an awesome workout that the whole family can have fun doing together ! much better than sitting in front of the or playing video games all day ! ! ! SMILE
this is a great dance vhs or dvd for kids that want to learn some updated dance moves the format is not boring the music is clean '' and the presentation is very upbeat and fun ! my 10 old and her friends love this video ! ! ! i highly recommend this video as a very good buy
i was very happy with getting strangers with candy from this merchant it was a good deal on a product that is often hard to come by many merchants were selling the seperate seasons for the cost i bought the total series and there were bonus features on top of it i also like the mock note pad packaging and besides all that i got my shipment early so all in all i 'm quite happy
this material is classic ! the cast is classic and i had to have it as a complete series to watch over and over brilliant comedy !
nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even william shatner would envy and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical as anybody who has seen this show knows the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for british comedy although as children '' of the three stooges americans are i think accustomed to somewhat comedy for those who do n't know this series it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids i would n't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20 by which time they will probably find this material boring if you are assembling a comedy collection however this series fills a unique niche my only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate it does n't even come in a box but rather in a little '' package which is neither aesthetic nor practical ca n't stack nor particularly protective it is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them i chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape works fine
this series is funny and it really does push the envelope i love the cast of characters especially jerry blank and who has n't dreamed with great terror ! of going back to high school again amy sedaris is wonderful in this series and so are her counterparts even though i was late in dicovering this show i still consider it to be a gem i only wish they had made more seasons i thought it was a great show 5 stars buy this dvd set ! ! ! ! ! it has all 3 seasons on it ! ! ! ! ! ! you will not regret it ! ! ! ! ! ! long live flatpoint high ! ! ! ! !
never really watched the series but saw the movie amy s is hilarious pushes the envelope on decadence with such a sense of humor ! enjoyable and funny even as you grimace
im a huge fan of strangers with candy when it was originally on tv and this was a must have it still is hilarious as it was back then being a huge stephen colbert fan made this so much fun to watch along with amy they are great comics and i wish this had another season they need to bring this show back
this was a series with hilarious supporting characters and a penchant for the weird it 's a dark comedy that you 'd never see on network tv amy sedaris is awful in a good way and stephen colbert paul dinello and the rest of the cast is fantastic episodes can be uneven and plotting was n't exactly the show 's strong point but nonetheless each episode is filled with great character dynamics scenes and dialogue it 's one of my favorites mar
for any fan of dark inappropriate humor this is the best buy in a long time the episodes themselves are brilliantly funny and the extras are even better if possible you get a very long blooper reel commentary from amy paul stephen on 9 of the funniest episodes an interview with the cast from the museum of tv and radio archives and so much more the packaging is a bit unusual but it 's less unstable than one would think a definite definite purchase
martin lawrence is one crazy man anything he is or will be in is worth watching
i had n't seen this movie in 10 years until this past weekend when it resurfaced on tv whew ! ! ! what a welcomed blast from the past martin lawrence was still in his heyday as a comedian in this movie 's 1996 release a sober bobby brown delivers an entertaining performance as martin 's pseudo sidekick regina king plays a believable it girl '' role and lynn whitfield totally delivers an oscar performance as a woman scorned and determined to make her man pay for all the heartache that comes from lies and deception this is one of those movies for playaz who manipulate relationships just to get some '' and move on the story is easy to follow there 's tons of subtle but gutbustingly funny scenes the movie moves along at a great pace you wo n't go to sleep on this ! for anyone male or female who 's ever had an adventure in dating '' with a nut you later question why you ever dated this movie 's for you as the movie 's theme song says the sweetest woman in the world could also be the meanest woman in the you make her that way '' you 're just gon na have to watch this movie to get it
a thin line between love and hate '' stars martin lawrence lynn whitfield regina king bobby brown and della reese this is easily one of my favorite movies i often watch it when i 'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times someone is always going through something worse than you the movie is a about a player womanizer named darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants he was able to get women easily because he was charming and of a hot club in town so he was looking for a challenge he found that challenge in brandy webb brandy is not your average female she is high maintenance and rich she does not deal with men like darnell for they are players darnell wants brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her while he is chasing brandy though his old flame mia is back in town from the army darnell still has feelings for but mind you he is still chasing brandy and mia is dating a well to do man darnell finally is able to get a date with brandy and after spending lots of time with her he accomplishes his goal and hits it '' after he hits it he loses interest in brandy and pursues mia however brandy is not going to let darnell go that easily she does all she can to get revenge on darnell the whole while darnell 's mother is warning him about playing women but he always brushes her off in the end darnell certainly learns a lesson i absolutely love this movie the comedic performance is wonderful i love the plot i have never seen a black movie with this type of plot so it was different martin lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie it is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled a thin line between love and hate '' the song and movie are about the same subject the sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world if you make her that way '' this is a line from the song i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama
a cross between lawrence humor and hitchcock suspence martin plays the playa '' and uses his comedic style to provide the humor this time there is less of the absurbed humor than in some of his previous movies the hithcock suspense is lynne whitfield 's character how many ways will she make the man pay and in the end to what degree does the playa learn his lesson for the martin lawrence fan there is no disappointment maybe his best to date
i like this movie it is pretty good this is a movie about lynn whitfield having a fatal attraction for martin lawrence i liked it i thought it was good bobby brown in this movie alongside martin lawrence i liked this movie it contains drama action and suspense also lynn did a ateriffic acting job she played her role very well five thumbs way up ! ! ! ! !
this is funny martin lawrence is hilarious i loved when his car windows were broken in front of the police station how funny
i thought this movie was a mix of boomerang and fatal attraction it had a nice cast martin lawerence lynn whitfield bobby brown small role but he did his thing regina king ladies man gets caught up when he plays the wrong woman and becomes a victim of her revenge the movie is not super great but it was a fun movie there are parts that will make you laugh
this film reveals the complex relationships of four chinese families whose roots from the past intertwine within the present causing conflicts and misunderstandings in their lives once the stories from the past are told and understood within the context of ancient chinese culture and values the bonds of love become even stronger and indestructable the stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film the viewer learns boys are more revered than girls a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her the expects a grandchild and blames the for failing to produce offspring not recognizing or accepting her son 's part in the problem this particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the who used superstition religion and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage in another life story a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman her parents disown her not believing this story they thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth to sustain herself she became his fourth wife a concubine but also produced a son an heir whom the first wife took ownership of as if he were her son the real mother was not allowed near her own child eventually she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother later she reunitd with her first child a daughter whom she raised within the businessman 's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice all the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the chinese daughter 's are experiencing in their adult lives through flashbacks in time each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother trying to please her yet feeling unworthy the film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based june one of the chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away the roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about june 's mother 's life in china june learns the expectations her mother had for her the hopes and dreams for her american daughter were part of an unresolved loss her mother never spoke about to june june learns about a very painful experience in her mother 's life which forced her to make decisions no mother should have to make however due to a letter written by auntie lindo to june 's relatives in china june is reunited with her mother 's secret past this is the point where everyone who views the film will need a handkerchief or tissues erika borsos pepper flowe
the joy luck club '' in my opinion is about as close to a perfect movie as i have ever seen i would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten the mostly chinese american cast is absolutely superb in their performances my favorite character is june the daughter of suyuan at the beginning of the movie her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to china to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died the movie centers around four chinese women and their daughters the experiences of the women in china apparently between the two world wars were often filled with sorrow and suffering their stories are told in chinese with english subtitles the experiences of the women in china as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the united states i have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie one is that the women as young females in china during the 1930 's are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them while as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender i generally applaud most of their actions it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of chinese women during that time period the joy luck '' is a great film in all respects the peformances by the actresses the general storyline the cinematography and the music this is a movie i can watch over and again enjoying very much on each occasion the ending to this movie when june meets her two sisters apparently in shanghai is a great scene and very moving one of the best endings to any movie i have ever seen
this movie is a beautiful story about four chinese women and their four daughters the stories deal with identity survival sacrifice love respect pride and forgiveness i cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship we carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives i have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of asian men after drying my tears from watching this movie something struck me hard because i felt this movie made asian men look bad yes there were two positive asian male characters in this movie there was the stereotypical asian father who played june 's father one of the daughters then there was lena 's second husband but he came across as a token it felt like the producers threw him in to keep the asian community from getting upset because there was no story development about him and lena 's life and their love but you knew exactly what happened with waverly rose and their white husbands the one character that really bugged me was rose her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an asian wife she put her husband 's needs before hers and as a result he wanted to leave her which she tries to stop it is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her worth '' after learning her worth she and her husband stays together the movie is blaming her and her culture for why her husband cheated but blames asian men when they do the same thing am i the only one that sees this i am a black female how odd for a black woman to be defending asian men and i have studied the asia culture so i know this movie is bias what strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to the color purple '' at least the black men like mister are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men of any race for their happiness as this movie does there is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man i am a traditionalist in that perspective but rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy if you want a more balanced portrayal of asian women and men check out the movies from asia however this movie is still a must see !
i was told to watch this film after i told someone i loved memoris of a geisha and i really liked this one told through mostly flashbacks the film tells the story of 4 elederly chinese women as they look back on there lives in china and then when they live in the us the story then goes on to there children and they show how they live there lives the film shows how the mothers are all in there children and then show the heartbreak and joyfullness of family the story is wonderfull and will get you hooked from begging to end the acting is great from each actress but the flawe is the film is long and i was ready for it to end but overall it 's agreat film to be watch by everyone
the joy luck club had stayed with me all these years even when i examine my own personal life in the current time i had read the book when i was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher she was lattimer and yes she was white a harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where i used to grow up sometimes i wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now still it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze the class was actually an advance seminar class even to this day i am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated r '' movie it was a never '' to watch a rated r '' movie the only movies that i can remember watching that were rated r '' were movies in my former ap english literature which actually contained nudity it 's funny because from what i recall i had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated r '' movie shown in an educational setting perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges even though i was never identified as gifted '' i was recommended it just seemed that every book my classmates and i read in ap english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element indeed the literary works were very great and of course sex is also shown in this movie besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters it was certainly a movie about survival presently as i sit in my comfortable room i could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss life is about survival the word survival '' will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind it is a word that summarizes the very essence of life when you 're child or an adolescent it is about surviving through school once you graduate from high school a new level of survival comes into play and that is to make a living let 's face it life really does center around making a living we all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable in times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds the desire to be married to wonderful wife or husband the desire to feel safe living in a dream home the desire to not feel frieghtened when you are heavily sick the desire to give your children and your grandchildren the best possible life and the list can go on forever let 's face it money may not be everything but it is certainly something we all strive to obtain in its various forms money does have its value contrary to the popular belief that you hear about how money is n't everything or how money ca n't buy love like the feather of the feather may look like any other feather and seem worthless but it comes from a far away distance and contains all of my good intentions
this movie has stayed with me since i first saw it almost 8 years ago i 'm very happy to have found it to add to my collection this movie explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter and though the story focuses on chinese mothers and their american daughters the struggles are timeless and so is the love
being first generation in an asian american family my sisters and i can really relate to this movie we watch it about once a year with our mom who is chinese and we always laugh and cry my favorite part is the scene with waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash we made our boyfriends who are all white watch that scene especially so they know how to act the part that always brings the most tears is the scene with june and her mom after the crab leg supper very typical of asian american families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch
flawless and beautifully rieveting '' the joy luck club '' has to be the best movie i have ever seen and probably will be the only one of it 's kind the story is beautiful and timeless and i encourage everyone to see it it makes you think of the relationships of your family and how even though this is a movie it can impact you beyond belief it will rock you to the core of your being and i am living proof
having asperger 's syndrome i was having trouble picturing what is in the book so when i watched the movie i finally had an idea of what the setting was what came to a surprise to me was that rosalind chao keiko o'brien in star trek was in it i liked that but i also liked the emotion behind the mothers when they were young especially it was saddening when we saw why suyuan had to leave her two babies behind i ca n't tell you why that would spoil it i liked this better than the book
who cares about the facts the truth i do evidently robert greenwald does n't this documentary collection '' will live historically as evidence that greenwald et al have distorted the facts for purposes of promoting their own self interest this is the kind of thing and the type of people that gives our party democrats a questionable odor in this respect their efforts have failed to attract the intelligent portion of our party to support their project i give it 4 stars for production quality and for distortion of facts which seems to be the real purpose and their true goal also 4 stars i 'm sure there are some who will disagree with my review be advised i simply call things like i see and hear them
at the risk of sounding like an old salesman you ca n't afford not knowing this information period the documentaries here are of good quality and well put together from start to finish they are a great place to start good for adding on to your civic library they discuss some weighty topics and glimse into things are being done around your consent we spend a great deal of our time feeding into the madness by not voiceing our opinion by not voting but at what price by and large a great deal of people have become complacent to the crap going on around them and the watered down news they are among other things it 's full of the underlying message that things are just the way they are '' do n't bother '' there 's no use trying to change things do n't rock the boat but what purpose and who does this message serve selling has gone from being in your face on the street to being beemed into your house packaged slick all contrived by guys with phds after their name the big corps know how to get their message inside your head '' information is a product and the best defense to be had by the best sales team that money can buy information begets power ultimate power leads to corruption and so on also check out the movie the corporation '' i think you know whos winning so far it can be scary stuff to comtemplate for sure and with threats that exist today on account of liberty we need to be cautious that our intentions are not misconstrued when we question authority figures but look what just hapened with enron becuase of a very long chain of people refused to question and demand proof of the spin that the ceo rank and file was putting out for years this chain included many bankers and many attorneys for many years enron execs got away with it until a young journalist stood up and said hey wait a minute ! i understand very well how large corps operate and what your telling me just dose n't add up ! this young woman wrote an article for a magazine that got the whole ball to start unraveling ! and in terms of the business world she was a nobody ! besure to see that movie enron too it explains a lot of things as well well we really live in exciting times in more ways than one ha scary maybe futile no i do n't believe so but what you do n't know about can hurt you and worse ! thats a fact ! these videos are a of a growing movement of people in all walks of life that are trying to get out and share what they know a veritable movement you 'll never see these or anything like them on television if you ca n't afford the money or the time to read all the books being written on these subjects there are so many these days than videos like this are a great alternative many of the facts and topics discussed can be verified and check to a great degree a lot of videos like this one use footage taken right from the news and reports that did n't get aired twice before they were yanked a lot of people are connecting the dots and lets face it videos are way more entertaining to watch ! this set includes 3 dvds plus a bonus one with lots of extra footage there are well worth the modest price
this collection brings together three movies produced by robert greenwald in one inexpensive box please note these are movies produced by greenwald he driected two of the movies but one unconstitutional was directed by nonny de la pea the three movies are 1 uncovered a selection of experts comes together to comment on the merits and logic of the intelligence on wmd that led us into the war to topple saddam hussein though the experts are not equally of one mind they seem to agree that the arguments for war were unsound and the war is unjust please note this is the original version of this film from late 2003 not the version released in 2004 2 unconstitutional what were the circumstances behind the passage of the usa patriot act what are its provisions what are its ramifications the sad fact is no one seems to know the language is muddy and incomprehensible and as it is with your auto loan so it is with your government if you ca n't read the language and understand it yourself someone is trying to hoodwink you 3 outfoxed media mogul rupert murdoch has his own idea what news should be and it 's not just cold hard facts media critics journalists former fox employees and others come together to dissect the fox news network and shed some light on the inner workings of its politically motivated machinery that take place out of sight of the public this collection also includes a disc of bonus content that embellishes on the content of the documentaries showcases the publicity that has accompanied the films and details some of the process of making and distributing the movies in a timely manner this disc is frankly boring not everyone will appreciate these films robert greenwald and his creative team start with a position in mind and marshal evidence to support the conclusion they want people so firmly entrenched in their beliefs that they do n't want to hear other arguments will shut their eyes and ears while people who agree with the positions in these films will only be ratified in what they already think but in a media environment that has fallen in love with the documentary film as a means of communicating ideas back and forth robert greenwald has perfected the concept of reaching out to an audience without resorting to the slick urbanity of morgan spurlock or the smirk of micheal moore this collection is a good way to get your hands on a thorough introduction to greenwald 's work this collection is recommended for political fanatics documentary afficianadoes and film lovers looking to learn more about the world around them
not quite as funny as i remembered but i was a lot younger then it still gets me to chuckle and is more clever than most children 's entertainment
this is always the question raised by fumbling but faithful companion pinky to his counter part the brain '' where on every episode are off from the laboratory to take over the world '' little lab mice with big intentions go out each night in hopes that this day will be their day but to no avail other characters appear in this collection that are equally runt smart singing cat not so bright dog both unwanted by society trying their best to carve out a good life for themselves also mindy buttons mindy a youngster basically being by her faithful dog finds herself in many compromising dangerous positions buttons saves the day usually getting the brunt of the pain too with very little if any reward from mindy 's mother spielberg cartoonists do a fine job on this project
pinky and the brain are hillarious as good as looney tunes were back in the day
wonderful fun stuff laced equally with stupidity humor for the and media addicted and humor for those with rather developed the only problem is this is only vol 1 there 's more episodes and they are n't here and of course you 'll want them now not later
pinky and the brain are my favorite and the collection is fantastic i have waited for years for this great job
this is a superb collection of one of my all time favorite cartoons
great selection of the best cartoon series ever video and sound quality is good special features are unusually interesting
this is soooo good about time that pink and the brain came out on dvd
i 'd always try to catch this show as a kid every time i watched it i was busting a gut with laughter the show was okay when on animaniacs and then became awesome when it sent solo well at least until the third season imho anywho seeing this show any time i want to via dvd is great and i 'd recommend it to anyone who 's a fan of the sho
after dvd 4 in this series turned into a recap it is quite a relief to find the story underway again with all of the characters following one path or another towards jaguera 's keep most viewers do n't realize that this is a 30 episode series the last four are an ova but even with that much remaining these episodes are tense and exciting as we build to our first chilling meeting with the darkest of the nobles the opening episodes follow tsume toboe and hige in their search for kiba as hope dims their irritation with each other mounts only the discovery of a native tribe calleed the hmong very much echo our own navaho and hopi cultures manages to keep the peace there the wolves are accepted and we first encounter the legend that it was wolves that were the first people from whom humans were made this experience makes so great an impression on toboe that he feels a strong urge to remain with the human tribe kiba in the meantime seems to have wandered into a version of paradise it is a beautiful world of woods and water where he meets a beautiful feline my who seems to be his soul mate gradually we realize that for all his happiness he is in danger of forgetting both cheza and his quest finally they are reunited and the wolves start out again after cheza somehow closer together for all their experiences the wolves come upon a battle between jaguera 's troops and the remaining soldiers of a large city the join in and are directed to jaguera 's castle when the seek clues about cheza 's whereabouts next attention moves to the fates of cheza blue hubb and cher several battles trigger a great deal of path crossing and the four are first reunitied and then split up to make their way to the final confrontation then we are back with the wolves on their trip across a sea of ice this brings about one of the most dramatic fights of the series as toboe suddenly comes of age as a wolf and ceases to be the runt of the litter in one spectacular moment finally we come to jaguera 's keep for one final chilling image once again we know why this has been a consistently excellent series one of the things that make this series so memorable is the consistent attention to character development so many anime hold themselves to a minimal amount of character writing we rarely see characters like go through the kind of development that quent yaiden work 's through as he realizes that blue is a wolf not the family dog or toboe 's remarkable turnabout in this dvd we wind up caring as much about the characters as we do the plot as much impressed by their depth as we are by the artwork and music wolf 's rain turns into a memorable experience rather than just an entertainment i can not recommend this series enough
this episode was just as good as the other five oh who am i kidding it was awesome ! ! ! the minute it came out i immediatly bought it these episodes were truly amazing the first episode was about how kiba thought he d found paradise and met a pretty girl there named mew but something was wrong their and he couldnt seem to remember much youll find out when you bye it meanwhile hige toboe and tsume are trying to find him hige seemed depressed i think its because they cant find blue i dont want to spoil anything else i guarrantee youll love this volume and you can tell its good by how much stars it has so please bye it and please see if this helped you it helps me alot to know if something is good bye ! ! ! youll love it ! !
i really enjoyed the wolf 's rain series but have not seen the final episodes fortunately some kind reviewer shibby decided to reveal some terribly important points about the ending in review as if it was totally irrelevant i will never understand the human race oh well i 'll get over it watch this show do n't read anymore reviews lest thy eye be stricken skip which are recap episodes if you can
after darcia 's keep is destroyed by another noble lady jaguara most of the main characters are seperated from each other kiba wakes up to find himself in an idyllic wilderness paradise with a creature named mew who can assume human form like the wolves kiba feels at peace and begins to forget about the past present and future has he found paradise or is there something more sinister working underneath it all as his friends desperately try to locate him they encounter a human tribe who look suspiciously like native american indians whose legends say they are descended from wolves as the human world begins to descend into warfare hubb and cher continue their search for cheza who was captured by jaguara 's forces along with blue and let 's not forget about quent the whose life just might be saved by the creatures he hates after being infuriated by the last volume of wolf 's rain which consisted entirely of flashbacks and recycled animation this was a welcome return to a series that i rank as one of the best like cowboy bebop this anime has a very american feel to me at times it seems equal parts fairy tale and visionquest in an interview with one of the shows creators it is stated that some people just wo n't get '' this series in other words they wo n't comprehend it and get behind it and support it but i promise you if you let yourself go and get involved in this story you 'll enter a world more incredible than any other film out there once again yoko kanno 's score is majestic and ethereal and elegiac with a few electric guitars thrown in for good measure masterpiece of animation and music and characterization the subpar extras continue as the only thing we get here are 3 textless endings audio is english 5.1 and japanese english subtitles if you want them also recommended cowboy bebop escaflowne there is also a manga version of wolf 's rain
i am a huge anime fan and this is by far the best lem me just say god i ca n't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan a few hundred years ago the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct there are people there even today that report wolf sightings occasionally SMILE if you 're a fan of wolves or looking for something a little different check this dvd out ! the musics great the drawing is perfect not just a random bunch of stills like most animes but actual movement ! you get 4 episodes per dvd each is a little over 20 minutes long this dvd includes 19. a dream of an oasis this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep kiba finds a place where he is truly happy and wonders if he has finally found paradise 20. consciously this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series it has gorgeous music and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever just brilliant 21. battle 's red glare orcom 's men are fighting against an enemy and the wolves are caught in the middle we see a lot of blue in this episode she 's so cute as a puppy SMILE and cher 22. pieces of a shooting star the group decides to cross a sea of ice but it turns out not to be such a good idea toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff i ca n't say enough about this series unless you 've seen the whole thing you ca n't judge it it 's made by the same people as cowboy beebop '' and this dvd is preparing us for the typical bones conclusion SMILE the next dvd is way sad and very depressing no matter how tough you are you will be crying by the end
i have seen plenty of anime but out of all of them wolf 's rain is by no doubt the best the plot is very well written and keeps you interested till the end dont listen to those who tell you the wolf 's rain is a stupid and simple plot because its not its only stupid and simple if you do n't understand it to get most enjoyment out of wolf 's rain you would have to know a bit of japanese mythology but its not necessary to still love it sadly the final episodes are n't out yet and those are the saddest you will ever see all of the characters except kiba die off in the saddest ways imaginable and the ending leaves a lot of open ends for you to consider i would give wolf 's rain a 10 out of 5 if possible
i 'm glad that i found this anime because it is unique and has a good story the actors are all good and the characters well fleshed out there is a good mix of drama and action in the episodes the animation is also very good
kiba tsume hige tolboy and blue head towards the city of the noble villeness jagera while along the way running into some familliar charactors the world it seems is rapidly coming toward the end as hubb cher and quint are in persuit we begin to learn of each 's background and it seems as though all including blue and cheza continue to run into circumstances where they trade off traveling partners and wat 's up with hige hige begins to suffer strange bouts of headaches and dementia all to do with his past there is a lot to it but as they used to say in the prisoner '' that would be telling '' again the storytelling soundtrack and animation are fantastic this series is something quite different than any other anime series i 've ever seen my only real complaint about the series is why we do n't seem to see too much of the wolves in their true wolf form i know there are a lot of idiots out there who like shows and games and who would equate stories involing animals as di neyesque yet this is a story as admitted by keiko nobumoto about a pack of wolves on a journey that fact alone makes this story unique i suppose they are trying to suggest that the wolves have human like emotions and feelings i 've raised and have been around wolves most of my life and in my opinion true wolves are probably the closest thing to humans in the animal world on a side note many of my friends have asked what 's up with the way the wolves are dressed in their human guises what i read into it is that the wolves do n't really understand the concept of fassion to them cloths are just scaps of cloth and leather that cover the body from the feet to the neck my suggestion to the producers is that if and when they make a film or season 2 the story would be alot more interesting and challanging to show the pack in their true wolven forms at least half the time if you have seen most of the episodes so far this disk is the build up to the fianl five episodes pay carefull attention because what happens in most of these episodes has meaning in the final five episodes if you 've only seen this series on adult swim pay attention to the opening credits never shown on the saturday night airings of adult swim through 2004 it has a lot to do with the final episode if you are about to order the entire series or just getting ready to recieve the final disk go out and get a couple of boxes of tissue to go with it it 's going to be a trademark studio bones ending ie cowboy bebop though more open to a film or a second season
this dvd possesses some of the best editing and production that i have yet to see in a child development product each of the sections cognitive physical and language is well researched it 's easy to understand and highly accessible just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development
this series of to walk '' to think '' and to talk '' is a great resource for development it portrays current research in a brief yet engaging manner i use it in my human development course and students consistently find it helpful informative and interesting in demonstrating concepts and research that we 're covering the second series of to feel '' to belong '' and to relate '' is also a great one
my profession is in child development particularly autism and i have been searching for many years for an effective teaching tool for parents and students that is enjoyable and informative at the same time i have even tried rather unsuccessfully to video typically developing infants and children myself to use as tools nothing can even remotely compare with this series of documentaries to walk '' to talk '' and to think '' i can not wait for the release of the baby human ii which includes to relate '' and to belong '' not only a great teaching tool but a wonderful baby shower gift ! pauline filipek md uc irvine school of medicine director for kid
i saw part of this series on cable and had to see more unfortunately they have n't come out with the full series on dvd yet i think this is the only one available it 's extremely interesting viewing and shows a lot of research done with infants as support i have n't seen any other programs like it
this was very well done the dvd presents various topics like movement speech perception related to infant development they include clips from some very interesting research studies the dvd is very fun to watch the true highlight of the dvd is the many many babies ! ! ! will give you some insight into infant development truly even if you are infant specialist and know everything there is to know about infants and toddlers this dvd is worth it lots and lots of cute babies in action
true this is n't a series for parents looking for advice as one of the previous reviewers critiqued but this is my favorite baby show and i am very glad that i can ditch my tapes now that it is out on dvd there are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single dvd let 's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all ! the episodes present classic psyc experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating if you are taking an intro to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep get this dvd ! actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the will help you remember the different cognitive stages they are just too cute ! and it is neat to see what tricks '' you can play on your own little fellow
a wonderfully insightful program whether you have kids or were one which i think covers just about everyone you learn not only about babies and toddlers but also about yourself and how you developed my only complaint is that there are not enough episodes available for purchase
this show is absolutely fascinating it is one of the most interesting and educational shows i 've seen about childhood development the show does a great job of showing various experiments being done at different universities around the country and then talking about the conclusions from the experiments the only reason i am not rating this a 5 is because they only included 3 episodes on this dvd i am pretty sure that there are more episodes in the series i 'd love to see the whole series on dvd
masamune shirow 's ghost in the in all of its is an exceptionally literate and stimulating franchise but the best of these incarnations is the second season of stand alone complex directed by mamoru oshii even at the most superficial level the visual and sound design of the series are pathbreaking but shirow 's vision for the manga was deeply informed by artificial intelligence theory and philosophy of mind this series continues to explore these themes even as oshii has added on layers of international politics speculative history diplomacy systems theory law bureacratic infighting japanese culture the final product is even richer intellectual and dramatic material than its closest rival the new battlestar galactica unlike the matrix this series gets better with each installment with a bit more of the puzzle revealed in each installment this is because also unlike the there is a point this is not an endless symposium on the dualing natures of technology and humanity it is and these questions are ultimately resolved the stories are so complex and the pace of the series is so quick that many viewers complain that it is impossible to follow but this is merely an invitation to multiple viewings and they repay the effort with interest
the seconf gig is trying to be good i only watch the show just to see the action the story is boring i love the being opening scene with the music playing even the animation is a little better then the first season and its a bit more mature then the first season
the second season of ghost in the shell gets off to a very slow start filled with talking heads that inform us how the political situation has changed since the previous series ended it could n't be more topical to contemporary america you see the main conflict of the show is being caused by a refugee problem after the last war lots of asians immigrated to japan in search of a better life since their countries were poor and japan was relatively rich they were welcomed at first as a cheap labor force but over the years the japanese began to think twice about the situation and realized that the immigrants are a huge tax burden a new conservative government has been formed promising to deal with the problem once and for all but there are elements within and outside of the government who are not prepared to wait for legislation so in the first episode here a group called the individual 11 '' takes the chinese embassy hostage to protest against the parasitic immigrant population section 9 is called in to rescue the hostages and if no innocents are killed they are promised full reinstatement by the new prime minister in the second episode another human scarred by the war and its effects fantasizes about mattering in a society that does n't recognize the need for love in individuals he constantly daydreams about killing all the people he despises and even falls for the major who he mistakes for a prostitute in the third episode cash eye '' is the name of a thief who is so good that she even tells her victims when she is going to rob them ! it 's up to section 9 to stop her from robbing a who will be busy giving a soiree at the appointed time attended secretly by very dignitaries lastly in an episode reminescent of an early episode last season an attack helicopter whose pilot has had a heart attack is taken over by its ai and suspiciously is joined by other unmanned aircraft in the immigrant district of the city their purpose section 9 is called in by one of the government intelligence services who seem very aware of the situation as though they knew about it before it happened gig has a very different feel from the first season which seemed obsessed with catcher in the rye references and cyber crimes of sometimes enron complexity this first volume seemed firmly grounded in problems namely what do you do when the equivalent of a slave labor force begins to revolt against its masters and demand more rights some people believe they have the right to be here some that they should all be kicked out when a population sees itself as threatened they fight back whether this population are the legal citizens or the immigrants of course this show came out in japan long before the current immigration issues that are now plaguing america but it 's just eerie seeing this the situation in the us could very easily slip into the conflicts we see in volume 1 of gig everything about this second season is maybe the writing the second episode in particular is really slow since section 9 is hardly in it at all while i liked the experiment they did by doing that it 's too early in the show to take the focus off the main characters yoko kanno 's music while masterpieces seemed to strain to make boring scenes dramatic but most of her score improves the show especially a homage to the first ghost in the shell movie when the major falls backwards out of a turning on her camouflage as she descends after blowing a terrorist 's head off this show looks like it might be great once it gets past the exposition extras interviews with the director and two designers who worked on the show i would also recommend the first season of ghost in the shell sac the two gits feature films the second edition of the manga which features panels cut out of the original american release the matrix trilogy
well i thought that i was the only one who 's dts disc was freely moving in the box i 'm shocked to read i was n't but even though the package had to travel to germany i was pretty lucky because the dvd made it here without scratches i hate to say it but this is typical for manga video just think about the poor quality for the nge movie disc 's they tend to mess up either in production or packaging
for a little more background movies the puppet master plotline ghost in the shell ghost in the shell innocence tv series the puppet master in the movies never existed season 1 ghost in the shell stand alone complex season 2 ghost in the shell second gig manga ghost in the shell different than the first movie but related ghost in the shell innocence i have not read it ghost in the shell man machine interface a story set a few years after the first movie it follows the major in some later activities it appears to take place after the second movie but the second movie was published afterward and they do n't refer to each other as far as i know the second movie picks up after the first movie the puppet master affair plotline i have seen almost the entire gig series it possesses a more gritty and tight feel and story than the first season the animation style is markedly different in fact the whole production value while quite high was still lower than the first season this was something of a disappointment to me as i had expected them to exceed the past not fall behind it the story though is still interesting as section 9 fights for its own life and survival we learn a great deal more about the past and every episode is like the first season crafted with what i think is a certain sort of genius i await the end of the second season with great anticipation
i 'm in the uk and therefore it cost me quite a lot to have this package shipped over the atlantic but it 's the only way to see this series until way into next year as has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the dts disc the very one i want is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last 4000 miles ! the disc surface is now scratched and damaged i see no point in sending it back to amazon for replacement because the chances are it 'll happen again so i 'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance this item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it 's a great shame
the series starts right where the last one left off for those new to ghost in the shell universe it works like this ghost in the shell movie which launched it all ghost in the shell 2 innocence movie the sequel to the first movie ghost in the shell stand alone complex seven volume series on dvd available for purchase here on amazon in a box set ghost in the shell sac gig basically season 2 the movies have the same characters but the storyline and arcs are different from the series the second season or gig delivers more of what gits fans want including the great soundtrack by yoko kanno the music from the series is definately a big part of the series and the opening title music is just as good as the original we welcome back the entire cast in the season and introduce several developing plotlines in the first four episodes from watching the first four episodes it looks like we are in for more great from the creaters of the season
it 's a nice package overall definintely worth buying the ony dissapointing things are first the package design often you 'll find the first dvd loose in the metal case as both dvd 's pop onto the same spindle and often the outer one is n't pushed down far enough to click into place they end up fairly scratched by the time they hit the stores or your mailbox second the box promises a bonus of a textless '' opening which does n't actually appear to be on the disc note only one of the dvd 's has the bonuses not both
this is one of the best sci fi animes out there and the colour transfer and quality of the dvd picture is smoking ! the storyline seems better than the first season but i did n't really like how the two disc stick on top of each other ! other than that everything else is fine
i think we should all just pretend that john hughes died tragically in 1990 shortly after working on the brilliant uncle buck '' he was not at all involved in such films as baby 's day out '' or home alone 3 '' he did however make several great movies in the including sixteen candles '' the breakfast club '' and weird science '' the films enclosed in this lovely collection a lot of people have been very critical of the inclusion of weird science '' in this collection but i am not one of them it 's true that this is not really a brat pack movie but it is a john hughes film and it is great it 's also the third movie he directed the breakfast club '' is the second sixteen candles '' is the first so basically this collection gives us the first three classics that john hughes brought us so i do n't see the problem sixteen candles '' 1984 this will always be my favorite of the john hughes movies it 's a bonafide classic of the with wonderful performances from molly ringwald and anthony michael hall this is my favorite because it 's really funny long duk dong especially and anthony michael hall 's team of geeks but also sorta touching anyone can identify with samantha baker 's sadness and how she does n't really know why she 's sad just that she is sad that 's really quite touching in my opinion there are some great scenes like the one between molly ringwald and anthony michael hall in the shop room or when molly ringwald and her dad paul dooley recently on desperate housewives '' have a nice conversation at night in the living room it 's scenes like this that make the movie truly great more so than other teen movies the breakfast club '' 1985 while not my favorite of the john hughes films this is also a classic and quite possibly the most famous of his work i 'm a sophomore in high school and i still hear people talking about this one all the time which proves just how enduring and timeless the work of john hughes really is this movie is a wonderful ensemble with great work from molly ringwald emilio estevez ally sheedy anthony michael hall and especially judd nelson also paul gleason is the perfect jackass great fun with plenty of touching moments and a wonderful ending weird science '' 1985 this is just plain wacky fun it 's different in style from the other two films in this collection but i love it just as much it 's crazy and wild and out of control and it 's just great anthony michael hall and smith make the perfect geeks and kelly lebrock is so wonderfully sexy a noteable part of this movie is the incredible oingo boingo theme song weird science '' which is just about the coolest song ever so what about this set it should be noted that the three disks in this collection are the same three disks from the previously released high school reunion collection '' and even come with an ad for that collection the quality is great the movies are all remastered in anamorphic widescreen and look beautiful the cool thing is that sixteen candles '' and weird science '' come with their original theatrical soundtracks and not the changed vhs soundtracks which is really nice the thing that makes this collection distictive is definately the gorgeous binder package looking at the above picture is not the same as really seeing it this is just a beautiful piece of art it really is a binder with clasps and everything and the movies enclosed in little slips on the clasps it 's truly lovely and looks very noteable on the shelf this set also comes with an extra cd featuring eight great songs including true '' spandau ballet if you leave '' orchestral maneuvers in the dark weird science '' oingo boingo oh yeah '' yello '' and do n't you forget about me '' simple minds this set is definately worth buying for this cd i listen to it all the time i love these songs so much and each one is good although my favorite is by far if you leave '' followed closely by weird science '' trust me if you get this set you 'll find yourself listening to this cd all the time it 's just great so the only thing that this set lacks is special features i for one was very dissapointed to see that none of the deleted scenes from the tv versions of the film made it here all three have some footage that can only be seen on tv but universal was not generous enough to bestow it upon us which is a shame basically there 's nothing here in the way of special features except for trailers on the breakfast club '' and weird science '' so if you 're into special feautres you 'll be severely dissapointed however aside from that this set is great all three movies are classics and they 're presented with their original soundtracks in a lovely special case with a wonderful music disk how can you say no recommended
this is a great set although the extras are lacking and it would have been perfect if some kind of wonderful was included as well but the cd is a real catch for all the 80 's nuts like me cheers
first off these are the same editions as found in the high school reunion collection set of dvds if you own those no need to double dip the transfers are the same no extras and yes these are only the universal owned brat pack '' movies nothing has been changed to the three movies proper original soundtracks are here for sixteen candles and weird science tv versions often replace many of the songs as did the vhs copies all of them are in enhanced widescreen with 5.1 sound mixes the packaging is indeed a very cool little binder it includes an 8 song cd with the following songs '' true '' spandau ballet '' tenderness '' general public '' if you leave '' '' weird science '' oingo boingo '' oh yeah '' yello '' pretty in pink '' the psychedelic furs the soundtrack version not original recording '' do n't you forget about me '' simple minds '' i go crazy '' flesh for lulu if you bought them the first time around i would suggest just heading over to itunes or a similar service and downloading the 8 songs for less than 8 if you did n't buy the set the first time then it 's a neat repackage and will be a fun item for collectors and fans i do like the packaging a lot but it is bigger than your average dvd case so it wo n't fit easily in a holder if you have one that conforms to the standard release size the films are great ! sixteen candles the breakfast club and weird science are all fun even after two decades they do n't make teen movies like this anymore and all three films are like totally awesome i ca n't see anyone having a problem with what 's here sure it 's not the entire brat pack '' but it 's most of them besides you can always buy more inserts for the binder and add the ones you want to the collection
i 'm fairly sure the reason elmo 's fire and pretty in pink are n't in this collection is becuase they were made by different studios
okay when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago both sets were released by universal fear not i am here to tell you about the differences the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies like it 's closest cousin the high school reunion collection the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same '' the breakfast club '' sixteen candles '' and weird science '' the cover art on the dvd 's is the same no new bonus material with each film that i detected it has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off no one even really pegged this acting group the brat pack '' until around 1985. molly ringwald was one of the best known brat pack members and sixteen candles '' helped to start the whole brat pack phenom but no one ever considered weird science '' a brat pack movie trust me i remember the 80 's it always seemed like it would make more sense to include st elmo 's fire '' or pretty in pink '' in with this set this is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included the music cd includes the following '' true '' by spandau ballet tenderness '' by general public if you leave '' by omd weird science '' by oingo boingo oh yeah '' by yello which was in ferris bueller 's day off '' pretty in pink by the psychedelic furs do n't you forget about me '' by simple minds and i go crazy '' by flesh for lulu why include music from pretty in pink '' and not include the movie on to the packaging the packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning i own over 100 tv on dvd and box sets and nothing is like this the dvd 's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the dvd 's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases on the back page of the binder is a pop quiz for the most part it is very similar to the highschool reunion collection but it 's nice to have the bonus cd and the cool packaging however it would have been nice if universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection one must assume they must not own the rights to pretty in pink '' it 's listed as a parmount dvd because that is easily one of the best known brat pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term brat pack associated with it
i just have to ask how the other reviews can comment on how sloppy the package is when it is n't even released yet they have n't seen it the package is very cool it is a notebook 3 ring binder with 3 protective sleeves for the discs and 1 for the music cd this is a great package for those who grew up with the brat pack era i know what the packaging looks like because i work for the company who made them
my teenage daughters are fascinated with everthing '' which is of course fine with me seeing that it was my '' time SMILE this set of movies was a big hit ! ! !
kevin kline and sigourney weaver give outstanding performances in this film they are a delight to watch a very well written screenplay and a surprise that hollywood would turn out something so wonderful given their usual depictions of politics in general this is without a doubt my favorite film dealing with a political topic the character of dave '' is so real and perfect for the oval office he manages to turn around a corrupt government balance the budget using down to earth every day person tactics and unites the country during his short term in office as an imposter he exposes those in high places who are trying to turn things to their own advantage and brings a forgotten unpopular vice president to the fore front to take the helm at a very crucial time for america many of us have often thought that the presidency should be given to someone who is just a normal every day american without the wealth and prestige that is almost always associated with it dave '' gives us that chance if only fantasy you will be surprised by every turn of this adventure it is hilarious dramatic romantic and fun to watch you 'll find yourself wanting to go vote after you see this film highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
dave '' is a lot of fun as a gets to pretend to be president gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power and makes enemies i am a big fan of sigourney weaver and she is very good here kevin kline does well as well the forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love definitely worth a rental if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag
i 'm starting to think that the number one requirement for the job of president '' should be acting experience '' we seem to do rather well when we have an actor in office whether in fiction or in real life i also love ben kingsley 's character in this film someone with his integrity in the white house perhaps that 's too much to hope for we can always dream though and dave '' is quite a pleasant daydream even if it could never happen in real life
great plot ! a crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs a good hearted man named dave who thinks about others and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while two of the presidents regular staff try to get dave to do things that is contrary to dave 's character so the story goes on from there who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the white house this dvd picture was good and clear the sound was great and the case was in excellent condition if you like warm hearted type movies then this is the one for you i know i have enjoyed it over and over to me dave is about character good or bad and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us
it might be time for everyone involved in the bitter partisanship of contemporary american politics to take a few hours away from arguing and laugh a little bit there is no reason two people of differing ideologies ca n't get together for an evening and enjoy a very astute funny comedy as a way to break the monotony of anger and mudslinging pervading america 's political debates dave may just be the answer to all our problems
this is a great story entertaining fun with laughter and pathos mixed in much like life itself you 'll find yourself watching it over and over again it is a '' movie that will leave you smiling kline and weaver give outstanding performances
one of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel how they make us react dave '' a wonderful ivan reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time kevin kline shines as the president 's sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the the chief executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide the rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully the relationships between dave and the first lady as well as dave and the head secret service man at the white house are especially touching i absolutely love this movie you will too
movie the same tone as groundhog day '' immensely enjoyable kevin kline was just right
it 's a nice 'chick flick ' i like the way it plays out and i like the actors it 's worth owning
this documentary takes you inside the robin hood hills case and for me it made me doubt the outcome and imprisonment of the three teenagers it is honest graphic and sad but i think it takes you inside better than most other documentaries i 've seen
everyone should see this movie also everyone should buy it so they can show it to their friends so the word can keep spreading and hopefully and finally justice will be served
this is by far the best purchase that i have ever made i knew a lot about the case even before i saw the documentary and it even solidified my confidence in the innocence of damien jason and jessie even more after watching the testimony of dale griffis the mail order doctor john mark byers is full of crap and because of that he would make an excellent actor in hollywood
one of the best documentries in its genre '' paradise lost '' will keep you rivited till the then it 's not over cause you will start thinking about what you have seen and wonder what in fact really happened i know that loads of people firmly believe in the innocence of the and i wholeheartedly support a retrail but never have i wished more for something like a time machine '' so one can go back in history to this incident and see what the truth is to see what really took place there we must guard against the notion that the are without any blame and keep in mind that they have troubled backgrounds i firmly believe that someone like damien did dabble with various cults and unsavoury influences and i thought it was a mistake to try and deny that outright for instance i do n't believe for one moment a rebellious teenager would change his name to damien in honour of some priest who lived amongst lepers that just doesnt ring true and maybe that was their undoing to try and paint them as misunderstood totally spotless youngsters but please i am not implying they are guilty not in the least you have to watch paradise lost 2 once you have seen this one as it is a compelling to this tragic story
this film motivated me to do my own research and i read as much material on the case as i could possibly find especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty to be honest i had a natural skepticism about the west memphis three 's claims of innocence a coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her friends '' who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder i refused to believe it at first but it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends ' innocence when all is done and said it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts first please allow me to correct a few misconceptions from some of the other reviewers the michael moore mentioned in the credits refers to one of the little child murder victims not the filmmaker a couple of reviewers mentioned a necklace worn by damien echols which supposedly had blood on it from some of the victims actually nothing more determinable than common blood types was found one almost microscopic spot on the pendant was consistent with the blood type of damien echols one of the accused the other was consistent with the blood type shared by both jason baldwin one of the accused and steven branch one of the victims as well as 11 of the rest of the caucasian population of the united states all experts agree that tiny of blood can be transferred by a number of ways especially a teenage boy wearing the necklace against their bare skin police photos verify that jason baldwin had also worn damien 's necklace police photos taken two days after the crime show damien without his shirt and reveal absolutely no cuts abrasions or scratches whatsoever the closest thing to credible evidence the prosecution could manage to produce were four very tiny fibers found in the houses of damien 's family and jason 's family which were deemed by the prosecution to be microscopically similar to fibers from two of the victims but even the prosecution 's expert witness lisa sakevicius a criminologist from the state 's crime laboratory acknowledged that this was inconclusive and could have just as well come from products obtained off the shelves of the local furthermore charles linch of the southwestern institute of forensic science in dallas refuted the claims of microscopic similarities in his testimony no fibers whatsoever were found in the home of jessie 's family during the appeal process forensic scientists examining the crime scene photos and autopsy photos identified human bite marks on two of the victims this was confirmed by a forensic odontologist teeth impressions were taken from the three young men in prison none of these teeth impressions from damien jason and jessie matched these bite marks found on the victims the highly coerced confession '' from jessie misskelly a borderline retarded boy with an iq of 71 was so filled with obvious errors that it is an obscenity that it was treated as the basis for making these arrest i should mention that this confession '' came after submitting this boy to a 12 hour grueling without lawyers parents or counsel of any kind and included a polygraph test which he had passed but was told by the police that he had failed judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear about these interrogation techniques jessie misskelly refused to testify in court against jason baldwin and damien echols stating that he simply was not going to get up there and tell a bunch of lies '' this was in spite of an offer to remove his life sentence read dan stidham 's jessie 's lawyer case synopsis by copying and pasting the web address below http the scenario painted by the police and the prosecutors against the three teenagers is simply a scientific impossibility how on earth could there have been the massive blood loss caused by ceremonial satanic cult killings of three persons in the middle of the night without leaving one single of blood or any other body fluids at the scene did they sneak in the fbi forensic team to clean up after them when nobody was looking luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where the police had laid or transported the bodies it should also be mentioned that none of the scarce shoe prints at the scene matched jason jessie or damien either for a scientific view see this crime scene analysis and profile by one of america 's leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight on who might have actually committed the crime i must warn you it is a bit gruesome to say the least copy and paste this web address http so let us briefly summarize much of the evidence was based on the notion that damien admitted an interest in the wicca religion and the occult which many local people perceived as satanism this is not evidence of committing murder you can go to any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere in middle america and find plenty of books on such subjects furthermore neither jason nor jessie had ever expressed any particular interest in wicca or the occult both damien and jason wore mostly black clothes and loved heavy metal music so what the police actually confiscated 15 black from jason 's home as evidence to prove god knows what damien was undoubtedly a troubled teenager from a troubled family he was a bit of a teenager he wrote some morbid poetry so what a couple of young girls claimed months after the fact that they had heard damien say that he committed the murders any person listening to those testimonies would have found them implausible to put it politely a young addict who was in the juvenile detention facility claimed that the shy and reserved jason confessed to him the second time they ever met ghastly stories about drinking blood from the genitals of a murdered child while worshipping the devil the counselor from that facility warned the prosecution that this young man was not credible and gave them detailed reasons and there is no evidence that jason and this young man ever met even if they did the story is ridiculous still judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear or information that could have challenged the credibility of this witness the confession '' of jessie and the scenario put forward by the police and prosecution would have involved massive amounts of blood left at the scene there was not even one tiny that is a physical impossibility the simple fact is all forensics were either exonerating or completely inconclusive there was a lack of physical evidence to tie anyone or anything to the crime scene '' john fogleman prosecutor of the west memphis three sadly the west memphis police would not do anything more than a cursory and disinterested investigation of the most obvious suspect see the forensic profile mentioned above probably because that obvious suspect who had a violent history including family violence and a lifetime as a career criminal was also an undercover narcotic informant who was in a very tight relationship with the west memphis police anyway for god sakes see this film along with paradise lost 2 and read devils knot this is not a political film this case has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative democrat or republican left or right or even whether you support or oppose the death penalty i hope that we of all political persuasion agree that locking up the wrong people and letting the real killers get away is a very bad idea for an analysis of all details of this these two websites and if it touches your conscience please consider trying to help http http
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three the film 's strengths are that it does n't preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim 's families what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them the victims ' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone i hate them i hate them and the mother 's that bore them '' is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child no quite natural really but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in i 'll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time on the issue of the prosecution they had next to nothing a very questionable confession from a terrified kid jessie with a 72 iq hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind damien 's house which does n't match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because damien read about wicca he must be a satanist to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq damien is the key to everything in this film though the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no 's the second reason and the most important is that damien is obviously extremely bright normally this would n't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world damien scared them all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't
this film is a good overview of the case and primer for the book devil 's knot '' by mara leveritt it 's tough to present the details in the 90 minutes or so that it runs but it does a pretty darn good job of it while the echols necklace evidence is n't presented in the documentary it should also be noted that judge burnett 's incessant denial of every motion made by the defense while at the same time placating the prosecution at every turn is n't presented either it should also be noted for the benefit of some of the other reviewers that the blood specimens recovered from the echols necklace could n't be analyzed for dna only blood type one was a blood type match for damien echols and the other matched both jason baldwin and steven branch it seems highly implausible that 3 young men one mentally handicapped could pull off this horrific crime and only leave secondary fiber transfers and a spot of blood on a necklace the blood type of which matched one of the alleged perpetrators and only one of the victims if the documentary is biased it ca n't begin to the bias of the trial judge who would later also serve as the appellate judge the documentary is gripping but at the same time fails to show that the miscarriage of justice was almost entirely the handiwork of an anything but impartial prosecutor in robes named judge david burnett you need to read the book too
i watched this movie documentary with my husband a couple of days ago and i ca n't get it out of my head it 's one of the best documentaries together with paradise lost 2 revelations i 've seen i 've read lots of reviews on amazon about what people think of these three guys and i see that lots and lots of you think that they are innocent i just do n't know what to think this is a very difficult case but i found some things very disturbing like when damien said he changed his name because of religious beliefs i actually think it 's because he 's probably watched the omen i also think that if they did it that he was the leader because when you look at jason baldwin when he was interviewed alone he came across as this cute boy who has n't hurt a fly in his life well i sort of have my suspicions because when you see him together with damien he immediately starts talking like damien and taking after him saying the same things as damien and laughing nervously as for the father i think he 's innocent i know that there have been cases when people fool a lie detector and comes out clean '' but i actually do n't think he 's guilty the supportgroup that they showed in the second paradise lost movie revelations has this blond woman who 's talking about damien echols as if she 's in love with him i want to know why they did n't put the west memphis three through lie detectors they should have done that from the start i also would like to know if they knew the boys they supposedly killed since police found fibers from the boys clothing at the crime scene now what does that tell you ! ! i know that there are lots of people who wo n't agree with me on this but this is my opinion also if i was the one wrongfully accused i would n't sit and look like nothing happened as i think they did they could have at least showed some feelings but if they are innocent i feel very sorry for them but i 'm going the other way one this one
seriously guys if this film says anything to you then it is your duty to do something these young men were wrongfully imprisoned im not saying you have to donate your college fund but atleast spread the word tell people about tell people about awareness day july 23 go to events tell everyone you know about this cause and while you are saying i do n't have time for this '' remember that what is 5 minutes to you could help these boys have 5 minutes more of freedom seriously think about it
this story is so fascinating that i could n't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one 's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer arenas to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in cuba under castro johnny depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting drag queen
i read the book many years before seeing the movie both are testimonies of the mystery of the human spirit the wonder and love of life and the ugliness of human hatred
this is truly one of the finest films ever made exposing the tyranny of the cuban communist state over one of its weakest subjects the irony of the film is that the effeminate homosexual poet is actually the bravest the strongest and the most heroic man in the film the only real man '' is reinaldo arenas while the latin 'macho ' heterosexual males are actually cowardly accomplices with no honor guts or bravery reinaldo is a patriot a real man who does not lack the courage of his conviction this film will make you rethink the concept of manhood as our homosexual hero stood firm against the castro dictatorship continued his conviction in the world of literature which is dominated by a pro castro left thus guaranteeing that his works would never be published unashamed of his sexuality he faced death with the same conviction he faced injustice while living in castro 's communist cuba see this film one caveat i suggest you buy the dvd and see the film with the english subtitles the poetry and the dialogue will make the experience something you 'll never forget the imagery of the film is outstanding the musical score is perfect the scene with johnny depp both as a transvestite and as a gestapo like communist interrogator are in my opinion one of his finest performances especially memorable is lezama lima explaining to our hero that since the tyrant can not govern beauty he wants to destroy it allowing 400 years of cuban culture go down the drain while everyone applauds there are so many universal truths in this film that one simple review can not possibly elaborate of them however i guarantee that you will never forget this film just remember to use the english subtitles and it will stay with you for the rest of your life
it is hard to describe this movie because it brings out so many emotions without going into the story you can read that already let me just say on the negative side that it was a little difficult to understand in some parts because of the heavy cuban accent when the actors were speaking english johnny depp has a small but very memorable part it was a surprise actually to see him in such a camp '' part he makes a very pretty girl ! in parts you feel a sense of urgency you laugh you are disgusted and you heave a sigh of relief it also brings back memories of history when castro shipped out all the undesirables imagine your homeland having a moral cleansing '' branding you a pervert or disowning you because of what you are and what you write about without their censorship ! so much for communism ! you will probably come away a bit sad but better for it
director julian schnabel an artist himself has centered his two films on fine misunderstood artists basquiat '' with jeffrey wright was and lovingly portrayed the life of fernando arenas in before night falls '' was a little more complicated but true artistry shows through this writer a victim of castro 's cuba had a tough time dealng with his own personal situation as well as his powerful desire to write a fearless powerful performance by javier bardem carries this beyond any simple story schnabel managed to get johnny depp to provide a dual role or was it one as a gorgeous transvestite and the other as a nasty lieutenant of the guard olivier martinez unfaithful '' was strong so many beautiful men in one film acting against type very intriguing cameo appearances from sean penn and the great old character actor pedro armendariz as the grandpa were the great director hector babenco kiss of the spider woman '' also has a small 's bardem who carries this to greatness with schnabel 's sure hand cinematography was remarkably beautiful for an independent film here 's the influence of schnabel always the artist extras on the dvd include a real interview with arenas a short video recollection by schnabel 's daughter lola taken during the filming in mexico another longer extra includes a tour of schnabel 's art studio which i thought might be a trip but is actually quite insightful into the mind of this talented it 's the remarkable beautiful javier bardem that is the 1 reason to see this film he 'd won many awards for it including the independent spirit award and an oscar nomination i 'm very impressed
this film is really intriging for someone who does n't consider herself a drama fan this film me in and kept me hooked the story of this writer really made me think about how art and drive and will to live can help someone overcome the most stacked of odds it is also a very interesting look into gay politics in that time and place in the world as a person studying glbt studies as a degree i recommend you view this film as a human being i recommend you view this film most people see it because of johnny depp 's performance as 2 characters but that fact is very minor although he does an excellent job the main actor is astounding and makes you believe what is real even though it is so unbelievable
actor javier bardem gives a staggering performance as cuban poet reinaldo arenas which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film in fact he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit piecing together as it does the various episodes of arenas ' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process at the same time this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the persecution experienced by cubans more effectively than either carlos eire 's memoir waiting for snow in havana '' or hollywood confections such as sydney pollack 's havana '' or richard lester 's cuba '' director julian schnabel an artist himself who had previously directed a film about celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat jumps back and forth like an abstract painter clarifying time periods by employing captions we first see arenas ' birth in 1943 rural cuba followed by glimpses of his childhood the story then moves forward to 1958 just before castro rose to power and when arenas becomes a revolutionary living in eastern cuba by 1964 as both an open gay and an intellectual arenas ' writings have made him anathema to castro 's regime for the next fifteen years he shuttles back and forth between jail and freedom and arenas ' story sheds much light on the difficult of living as a member of not just one but two minorities in highly visual terms schnabel creates a striking tableau of life in cuba that shows how getting out of cuba was not an easy decision for natives to make and arenas like most cubans makes it only begrudgingly at first imagine having to give up everything and fleeing there is a vividly filmed sequence of an party in an abandoned convent that houses a homemade balloon shades of jules verne by which one of them decides to escape selfishly and fatally there are also some powerful scenes that show the humiliating torture arenas experienced in prison ending finally with his escape and ultimately his departure from cuba in the mariel harbor exodus of 1980 as one of castro 's undesirables '' arenas then went into exile in new york living with his former lover lazaro sadly soon after his arrival in america he became ill with aids the american sequence is short allowing maximum time for the cuba ordeal that makes up most of the film the charismatic bardem is superb capturing the emotional combustion in his character 's life there are a few guest appearances that somewhat undermine the story 's realism a nearly unrecognizable turn by sean penn as a cuban peasant and in dual roles johnny depp as a sadistic closeted lieutenant and a transvestite named bon bon who entertains prisoners in el moro prison and the use of english versus spanish seems to be more at the director 's discretion than the actual circumstances within scenes but these are forgivable indulgences since schnabel has made a valuable film telling a tale of cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly do n't see that often in film at 133 minutes it does seem a bit overlong but arenas packed a full life in his 47 years most importantly schnabel successfully paints a picture depicting the influences behind arenas ' writing his difficult childhood his conflicted feelings for his mother coming to terms with his sexuality the revolution in cuba and the pain of being an outcast in his own country as one might expect from a painter schnabel uses images as effectively as words to advance the story most are simple and quite beautiful such as an early scene of a rainstorm that turns into a raging torrent of water a later shot of countless prison inmates dangling bars of soap outside of their jail cells or flashes of snow falling in new york as arenas and his friend lie on a speeding convertible nevertheless because arenas as a writer dealt in words it is impossible to tell his story without embracing this component and bardem 's economical voiceovers attest to that aspect in a dramatically effective manner strongly recommended in spite of the relatively minor flaws the dvd also includes an interesting french television interview with the real arenas from 1983
successful in describing what cuba is all about this film is also about life it made me think that not only in this writer 's case but great writings or other creative works were made in prison there is something about prison that can force us grasp the nature of life or perhaps it can also be said that nothing can kill truly liberal mind in the movie english was spoken among cubans in cuba whereas suddenly they start speaking spanish without translation i find it very annoying it makes a perfect sense if they spoke spanish in cuban prison and start speaking english after he left cuba i live in miami and am surrounded by thousands of cubans so i know that cubans in cuba do not typically speak english to have conversations among themselves i do n't mind subtitles while the scene was in cuba and i wish what was what they did unfortunately this language is the reason why i can not give 5 stars
i initially wanted to see this movie because i am a huge oliver martinez fan and i wanted to see more of his work the fact that oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me i was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that i hardly noticed oliver was missing javier bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors i have ever seen i was mesmerized by his protrayal of reinaldo arenas and while this movie may not be for everyone i would say it is the best biographical movie i have seen in my lifetime as added bonuses there was oliver martinez for me of course also sean penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen johnny depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer his facial expressions alone are pure comical genius and while i am a huge johnny depp fan as well i am glad his parts were minimal as javier bardem is the true acting genius in this film i am now going to further investigate reinaldo arenas and javier bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me is n't that the true motivation of a movie or writer you want more from them
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest '' woks the way it does billy nighy gives an performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars '' yes i prefer pirates '' over tlotr although perhaps my comments are premature since at world end '' has n't even been released yet should that be a dud then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates '' on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out
as a teenager i have to say that this movie was was awesome yet still def ca n't wait for it to come out on dvd
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind '' or even lord of the rings '' you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh to gross you out to surprise you with its clever twists of plot to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates ' treasures
i loved this movie i did n't think the plot was patchy at all and i did n't think it was hurried either what i do think is that people forget that the movie company had the third movie already in the makes when the second was in theaters i was taken away with the plot it was so deep and there were so many threads of different and different ties that would explain something later that i was breathless like for one what is with his hat does it too have magical powers his compass ! i loved how that took a whole knew leap ! heck i want to know if the little dangly coin in his hair by his face has a significance everything about jack sparrow has a reason him carrying the gun with one shot you did n't find out why he kept it till the very end kept it to pay back barbossa anyway people should not view this second movie as a no view it as you did the lord of the rings 'll take more than one movie to get the entire plot told what i think is that the script was so long but so good that the company decided not to cut they did n't want to cut out all the originality of the story they decided to just cut the script in half and have it told in two movies i believe all those 'plot holes ' people complain about in this second movie will be answered in movie three that 's what i think anyway i loved it though i do agree that the love triangle with will elizabeth and jack was weird even had me tilting my head in confusion but again there 's probably a reason for that the hat ! hah ! maybe the hat keeps the women away SMILE who knows ! we 'll find out in may aye but like i said do n't view this movie as a see it as the first half of a continuation that it is i loved it and i 'm anxious for the third movie to come out i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good long that have hidden meanings in words and actions and twists in a plot that will shock you and yet excite you at the unexpectedness of it i think everyone 's questions will be answered in movie three 's the whole point to having a 'to be continued ' at the end of the movie right it means there is more to come and there is more that needs to be explained so enjoy this movie and enjoy that feeling of excitement and dissapointment that you have to wait for the third to come out in order to see the conclusion to this plot i loved it i 'm a writer maybe i 'm used to seeing things like this because i do it myself why cut off a story at a point where a reader will be satisfied nooooo you cut it off at a cliff hanger so that they will come looking for answers and to see if the characters will succeed it 's an old trick used since the beginning of time it builds tension and i think ontop of people forgetting it 's a story they did n't want to be left hanging and forced to wait face it we are n't a patient society and we want everything now but our patience will be rewarded in movie three so enjoy movie one with it 's completeness and enjoy movie two as the beginning of the grand adventure because it 's just the beginning everything will be answered soon and the plot will only thicken least in my opinion
my expectations were high for this film they were met but just barley with another jack sparrow produced adventure this film suffers the weight of a confusing script a bad performance from orlando bloom and the sheer amount of volume they attempted to cram '' into this picture the visuals in this film are fantastic the music is and the sound is rich in detail the script however seems to be attempting too many plot lines to keep a precise view on the major storyline i 'm sure they needed to get some necessary material out of the way and developed in time for the third film but it seems to me to be too much ! plot spoilers the characters also suffer in this film jack sparrow and barbossa are the only and well performed characters will and elizabeth seem more like composted studio produced nonsense this film is no exception bloom did not live up to my expectations on character development by any means for example when will finds out his father is alive it is as if it does not surprise him all that much after seeing him successfully command a siege and engage in a love affair with a king 's wife in kingdom of heaven director 's cut i expected so much more from him knightly on the other hand seems to fair a little better with the material her performance in this film was much more dynamic i especially love johnny depp 's conversations with her she seems to be getting a handle on her character by the time we get to the end of the film i feel like i 've been at la fitness all day i feel pumped but i also want to sleep asap overall this is an average film heightened only by its technical achievements and a few good performances recommended but proceed with caution the third film might get a little shaky since it bears the weight of the first two and the high expectations of a good original plot payoff
i did n't notice it was a bad movie all i saw was johnny depp seriously it 's a great movie i think maybe people are forgeting this started out as a childrens ' movie
cheap trick is one of america 's greatest contributions to pop culture they 've never stopped touring or recording and as great as their records are this band really has to be seen live to be appreciated go see them as soon as you can in the meantime the fabulous songs and the band 's image overcome the relatively poor video and inconsistent audio production on this dvd although the editing is not bad you do get to see pretty much what you want to see when you want to see it the boys are playing hard here in support of the lap of luxury release whose hits do n't be cruel '' and the flame '' put them back on top where they always belonged on top of the world '' the song of the set drives up into the starfield with 5 giant bun carlos snare thwaps as robin zander rears back for one of the great codas these guys deliver on so many levels and it 's great to see them performing songs you may not have seen them do in a while big eyes '' and clock strikes ten '' in particular along with the core list of big hits big elsewhere hits small hits album favorites and zander is astounding as usual and it 's really cool to hear him talk in the short clips of the band hanging out in sidney and compare his seemingly normal speaking voice to the roaring and endlessly diverse controlled juggernaut of his singing voice although never had a lot to lose '' sounds like it was recorded on a microcassette after repeated listenings i 've decided it may very well be zander 's vocal monitor mix recorded straight from the mixing board although the sound quality is jarringly inferior to the other songs in a way it 's pretty interesting because zander is loud in the mix with no reverb or delay effects so you really hear every little thing presumably the same way he hears it on stage for example on the bridge when he sings 'not 'til daylight ' you hear his vocal cords break into harmonics something you 'd never be able to hear normally rick nielsen is at his goofy finest tossing flatpicks brow sweat and a guitar wall of mastered mayhem tom petersson inventor of the bass doubles the height of that guitar wall by generating more tones than a color wheel while simultaneously anchoring the songs tightly to carlos ' elegant but playful foundation the silver '' and music for hangovers '' dvd 's are superior productions overall but this one is a very good 's snapshot of a magical band an absolute for true fans
real funny performance especially as steve performs without cussing '' sent a copy to my family in england who enjoyed it as well
i brought this dvd and can seem to stop watching it it gets better each time i watch it ! ! ! ! you have to see for yourself be blessed
this is a wonderful dvd entertainment you can see with your family as well as take it to church i am so happy he decided to perform clean humor is already a comedic genius his is much more funnier
my friend told me about this dvd but i was a bit skeptical for i have never listened or watch anything by steve harvey however i was glad i bought it it 's funny and it 's clean i will be watching it with my grandchildren and it is something to add to your collection for retirement age
he is not a new comedian right now he is the man ! what a range with clean or dirty harvey is one of the best out oh this dvd great
i have enjoyed steve harvey 's comedy for many years and was really happy after watching this that i could finally share this with my children steve 's jokes surrounding the church my offend some but having been brought up as a church kid '' i find them accurate and hysterical i thoroughly enjoyed this and have already watched it a few times i hope he keeps up this style of comedy
i got a chance to see this dvd on a trip to new york this summer watching it on the bus ride i decided right then and there that when i got home i would purchase this it take 's a lot of courage to change your style that so many are use to yes i liked the foul mouthed steve but i also love the clean mouthed steve i think the dvd is worth purchasing just to see him introduce god if given the chance and when he come 's i pray he allow 's steve harvey to introduce him
i usually do n't find most comedian fall down funny but steve harvey brought his a '' game to megafest with this know for his foul mouth steve harvey proved why he is one of the king 's of comedy ! ! !
i loved this dvd ! although it was n't his funniest it was still side spliiting funny ! he proves that you can be funny without cursing
this movie will become a family classic favorite and the music is superb great music script acting photography and directing all without the hollywood scat treatment a fun and uplifting movie that all ages can enjoy if you wish to see charlotte church be an angel and sing the music that she has become famous for forget that she plays a daughter with a golden voice hidden from her mother she sings a classical piece as well as george gershwin 's summertime aria in a manner to rival ella fitzgerald that is great praise for a welsh lady singing a southern american classic all of the the actors were awesome in their british quirkiness the ensemble of actors brought this script to life and obviously all had great fun doing it for most of them i do not think they were acting they were themselves dressed up to play and work with friends it is they that lift this movie from the ranks of good family entertainment to superb family entertainment i have purchased more than one copy of this dvd movie many as gifts to family and friends who had never heard of it in american theatres five stars for good entertainment
this is the best of the craig ferguson 's films saving grace is a close second and the big tease is a third favorite he is a middle age rock star on the edge of losing complete control his saving grace '' that pulls him back from the edge is to find out his has an unknown child a teenage daughter the whole movie is funny and touches us in lots of ways a great movie and worth your money
i put off watching this movie for some time i 've had a hard time accepting the fact that the charlotte church so many of us fell in love with seemingly one of the last remaining bastions of wholesomeness and purity in this world has caught a virulent case of and has actually sunk even lower than britney in a fair number of ways and is seemingly lost to us forever i 'm really quite saddened by the whole situation nevertheless i can still adore the girl charlotte church used to be and happily there are traces of that girl immortalized forever in this film i was actually quite surprised by i 'll be there charlotte 's no jodie foster but she 's a far better actress than i expected her to be and this really and truly is a good movie it does n't take us anywhere we 've have n't been before but it 's a fun ride charlotte plays olivia edmonds a teenaged girl who finds out that her father is actually famed aging rock star paul kerr craig ferguson just after he makes headlines for driving his motorcycle out a second story window of his home olivia 's mother never told her the truth about her father because the relationship was kerr never even knew he had a daughter and she resents the fact that her own father was never there for her growing up she wants olivia to join her hairdressing business and stay away from musicians at all costs we all know charlotte has the best singing voice in the whole bloody kingdom but her mother does not realize just how talented her daughter olivia really is anyway olivia and kerr slowly develop a relationship with one another helped immeasurably by kerr 's decision to stop drinking but dear old mum wants nothing to do with the man she 's obviously still in love with everything comes to a head when olivia 's talent is made manifest and you can probably fill in the rest yourself as i said i 'll be there does n't break any new ground but it 's a movie that succeeds extremely well craig ferguson makes it all work and injects a lot of comedy into everything he does as writer director and star this really is ferguson 's baby and should have enjoyed more success than it achieved it even supplies the somewhat disconcerting sight of the buffyverse 's rupert giles anthony stewart head playing a smarmy music agent earrings and all of course you also have the added attraction of several charlotte church songs even if they do represent her early foray into pop all told i 'll be there is a surprisingly entertaining motion picture and those are few and far between these days
a low budget film yes but it really works and i really enjoyed it which surprised me no end once again a plot that is not rocket sciene which is good when you want something ease on the brain to watch a 80 's pop star paul kerr craig ferguson who moves to wales on a spur of the moment decision and in doing so discovers that he has a teenage daughter olivia charlotte church living in his new backyard olivia was the result of a weekend affair he had with her teenage mother during the height of his fame and his arrival in the small welsh town unsettles the orderly but now very boring life of his rebecca jemma redgrave we are treated to fun galore as paul tries to get to know his daughter whilst trying to woo her mother back into his arms olivia in turn is having her own problems with her mother rebecca does n't want her to become involved in the music industry her own father is an aging rocker who is always on the road with his band and the man she loved seemingly abandoned her for his career anthony head giles in buffy the vampire slayer as paul 's foul breathed manager is a treat there are some great funny moments like when paul finds out that his best friend 's girlfriend is scottish and she just happens to be called nessie the scene on the motorbike when paul and rebecca race to london to rescue '' their daughter is hilarious you can see the sparks of attraction flying between them and the scene in the hospital is hysterical along with the pub scene when the locals worry about the possibility of americas moving in '' not to mention the soundtrack to the film is lovely especially with all the songs that charlotte church brings to life with her glorious voice this is a lovely film with a cast of fine characters look out for joss ackland as rebecca 's father phyllida law as olivia 's teacher and imelda staunton in rippingly good form as the dr bridget
after a drunken accident beginning with a dance in ya underpants a la tom cruise in risky business rock star paul kerr formerly with the love rats a hard rock outfit with fluffed out 80 's hairdo discovers that he had fathered a child through a woman who attended a concert of his in 1987. that child olivia is now sixteen guess who and has a gift for singing and it 's only because of his accident that her mother rebecca still nursing a bitter grudge and a broken heart reluctantly admits that paul is her father rebecca 's bitterness comes from the fact that she wrote paul letters that she was pregnant letters never answered furthermore her father a tough bearded septuagenarian who plays 50 's rock and roll and blues goes by the stage name evil edmonds fronts a band called the was on the road too much to be a good parent to her and as a result rebecca is barely civil with her own father in fact rebecca was born on the tour bus the bobs use for their gigs ! she is a single mother and also an entrepreneur running a hairdressing salon named cheeky chops nice name ! with a gay colleague paul 's accident leads him to turn his life around the love rats ' a chipper australian named digger hears the news and tries to get his bandmate off the wagon olivia who wants to sing instead of doing nails and hair visits her father to get to know him better however her mother associates the music business with the same atmosphere that led to her pregnancy and protective of olivia forbids paul to see their daughter after all where was he when she was raising olivia the best way to get to know her father is to listen to her music and olivia buys the love rats ' hit album lost woman the rear of which has the dedication to rebecca '' meaning that paul did care but rebecca sees that as a sign that olivia 's traveling down the same road as her father as an acting debut it 's not much for charlotte church but she acquits herself in that she does n't play the usual pouting rebellious teenager railing against mum dad and grandpa she 's cute driving around in her pink moped with matching helmet to boot her welsh accent comes through not a debit as she 's playing a and oh yes does charlotte sing ! apart from summertime '' from porgy and bess which can be found on her eponymous album she does three new songs in hebrid seas '' the creamy ballad would i know and an acoustic and versions of the four tops reach out i 'll be there '' that latter is rebecca 's favourite song hence the title walter afanasieff of mariah fame produced and arranged those new songs with diane warren penning would i know '' and if charlotte decides to record again that sounds like a logical next step in her career i was used to seeing jemma redgrave as the progressive romantic idealist female doctor in the victorian era series bramwell quite a change for her especially with blonde hair as rebecca she does well portraying someone who is still stung by the past which affects the expectations she has for her daughter ralph brown digger has a great rapport with craig ferguson paul and interacts well with charlotte but it 's joss ackland as evil esmond who 's the real surprise after playing heavies white mischief lethal weapon 2 sherlock holmes copper beeches he 's quite a delight as a still singing songs like the standard trouble '' and that 's phyllida law emma thompson 's mother as williams charlotte 's vocal coach this cute comedy sadly did n't make it my local theatre given that it was charlotte church 's film debut i would 've gone on opening day not a classic by any means but it 's still a delightful number benefiting from the performances and some funny lines all around most people might give this 3.5 stars but fans of charlotte might boost this to 4 or 4.3
i 'll be there is actually a good movie ferguson is funny and has some great like like silence of the lambs line church 's acting is good and her singing voice is even better a totally enjoyable movie
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic which i found utterly depressing more to the point though who cares about the problems of these rich kids not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film check out less than zero another gloomy but solid underrated film the worst film is bright lights big city do n't say i did n't warn you !
i love this movie admittedly it looks better after all these years than it probably did back in the cinematography is great molly ringwald looks great and it has a dark and peculiar charm all it 's own i was never into the brat pack movies but this interesting failure came out at the tail end of the brat pack era and as such perfectly captures a moment
i love 80 's movie and this is one of my fav cryer did a great job in this hiding out in a school attenting the school when he is way over age it was just
hiding out has been hiding out from the funny 80 's teen flicks it has been lost in between the brat pack and john hughes finest but it is just as as the rest of them jon cryer plays andrew a stockbroker running for his life from the mob and the feds who are attempting to protect him after narrowly escaping from the mob andrew assumes a new identity in a new town what is not planned ahead is the fact that he will be a again the interactions with teachers fellow students love interests and his dorky cousin patrick make this movie quality for the genre it belongs in good soundtrack and memorable quotes round out this lost flick
this movie was cute back in the 80 's and it still is today jon cryer is wonderfully charming and annabeth gish is one lucky girl keith coogan is funny as always one for the collection
i ca n't say enough about this movie it 's clearly one of the most underated movies of the 80 's and sadly it was considered one of his worst movies along with many others by pretty much every critic umm it rarely airs and not many people have seen it before like the viewer before me said it needs to be 've enjoyed this movie on vhs for years 13 years to be exact and have finally just gotten it on dvd with his talent he deserved alot more than he got out of his acting career in my opinion hollywood is and always will be overated bring back some people who can act ! ! he 's great on his show but i 'd love to see him in more main stream movies and hell i do n't care if they tank i 'll watch them anway ! ! how can you not love jon 's quirky yet enjoyable acting style and those cute dimples of his ! ! ! yeah i 'm a girl ca n't help it give this movie a chance you 'll love it if you do n't something is seriously wrong with you SMILE 22 year old viewer
once upon a time there were some very interesting movies made this was during the some directors had some interesting ideas about showing how high school can have quirky moments and be educational sometimes but also give life lessons that will help down the road even the teachers have political viewpoints not just parents maybe not anymore after all that would n't be politically correct any more to talk about that in class i feel sorry for students today so many things are not allowed i do n't know how they can learn anything about life and having a personality well back to this movie it is jon cryer 's best from all his movies that i have seen funny and suspenseful with some love thrown in for romantics cryer is a stock broker andrew morenski that finds himself on the run from hitmen he hides out with a nephew and finds that being high school student max hauser is a good cover cryer is excellent and the rest the supporting cast are great as well any fan of movies like ferris bueller 's day off '' and the breakfast club '' will probably love it
a light hearted but still kind of sas movie poweful
this movie was superb i wish it was available in pal not just 's ntsc format i was both inspired not only with it 's hysterical insightful humour but with it 's global appeal it brings out themes that everybody can relate to not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes the movie has great wit and side splitting humour it 's such fun to watch and this man is a star ! he really should be more widely recognised a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character time to come and do a show in south africa too ! what a talent ! ! !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we do n't have the same taste in movie
great entertainment for the whole family tyler perry can present the most serious problems in this country today and still make you laugh
anything madea is in is worth watching ! this movie had it all i loved it
a large cast of well known actors such as cicely tyson do an outstanding job in this movie tyler leaves you with that warm and fuzzy feeling
this is a good movie ! it is better than diary of a mad black woman
blair underwood own 's this he plays an abusive fiance with a passion for getting his kicks off by beating the love of his life everyday bret fetzer movie reviewer is not abreast to the diversity of blair underwood 's brilliant performances such as just cause 1995 and asundar 1998 in which he plays a psycopath be it psycopath sociopath you name it and blair underwood will claim it ! !
to those who hate '' this movie please forgive us culturally depraved lowly scum for daring to appreciate the pure entertainment and moral value of a polished movie that seeks to depict the good and bad within our diverse attitudes and ways of life let 's not forget that this is just a movie and tyler perry has ingeniously used this medium in a way that does n't take itself too seriously only someone with more of an open mind could appreciate that and know that there are some things you simply wo n't get '' not being that does n't mean everyone who 's black will like this film but clearly by the majority of reviews on this web site there 's a reason this film rates so highly among us po ignorant '' dark masses ! SMILE tyler keep doing what you 're doing ! signed a lover and participant of all legitimate art both high '' and low '' as long as it 's relevant peace
a real achievement i 've been a fan of gondry 's from his music video but this film is a whole order of magnitude different the most heartfelt of any of kaufman 's which tend to be sort of cruel and unrelenting at times despite their structural brilliance not a jim carrey fan either but he 's wonderful as is always kate winslet one the best things aside fromt he lush visuals particularly as their dreamword begins to decay is the special features which outline the stunningly simplistic use of camera tricks to achieve such innovative effects without leaning too much upon the convolutions of cgi technology absolutely one of my all time favorite films
eternal sunshine '' was my favorite film of 2004 and one of my favorites given that jim carrey starred that 's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people screenwriter charlie kaufman and director michel gondry in particular involved with this delightful and imaginative project both carrey and kate winslet play skillfully against type he shy and introverted she way their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to like eyes adjusting to a darkened room but it 's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view other treats include elijah wood frodo role as junior memory erasure technician and kirsten dunst spiderman 's girlfriend quoting pope alexander 's '' poem that gives the film its title my strongest recommendation as long as you can handle a little well a lot of time shifting
the title of this film is taken from a poem written by alexander pope entitled eloisa to abelard '' pope based his poem upon the lives of two real people who were involved in an illicit affair the poem is written from eloisa 's point of view and illustrates the conflict the woman has between her deep love for abelard and her devotion to god the movie takes it 's name from the lines how happy is the blameless vestal 's lot ! world forgetting by the world eternal sunshine of the spotless mind ! pray'r accepted and each wish resign 'd '' in which eloisa wonders what it would be like if she had never fallen in love with abelard and had the affair erased from her life that idea of being able to erase one 's memories is the plot structure in which eternal sunshine of the spotless mind revolves the film stars jim carrey as joel barish a shy man who usually keeps to himself but who thought he had found the love of his life in a woman named clementine kruczynski kate winslet clementine is everything that joel is not and the two individuals discover that not only do they complement each other but that they complete each other as well however after a particular messy argument joel receives a notice that clementine has had all memory of him erased from her mind joel tries to force the relationship afresh and fails he realizes that he can not live knowing that the love of his life has no memory of him and decides to have the procedure done himself while undergoing the joel begins to remember all the good times he had and everything about clementine that made him fall in love with her in the first place he then tries to fight the erasing by hiding out with clementine in other memories in his mind think of a bizarre and quirky it 's a wonderful life that might sound very confusing and that 's not even taking into consideration that 's not how the plot of the movie takes place because we see the story in reverse kind of like memento from the time joel and clementine had their last argument until they first met of course the movie actually begins more towards the end rather than the beginning and ends at a new beginning the film also has a small subplot about the in charge of the procedure tom wilkinson and one of his employees kristen dunst despite the labyrinth structure eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is one of the best romantic movies of the past decade it 's a very honest film full of emotion and heart it does n't sugarcoat the hardships and sometimes seemingly dullness that a relationship can bring but illustrates that the good times far outweigh all of that and that even if they did n't those difficulties are important because they make us who we are and help us to become better people besides the story and wonderful script written by charlie kaufman eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is notable for a couple of other reasons first the movie is one of jim carrey 's best performances ever carrey has given some performances before the truman show man on the moon but his performance as joel is his best to date if you had never seen jim carrey perform before you would never know that he became famous because of his comedy you would think he was a actor he should have been nominated for a best actor oscar here too but was n't secondly the film is a great example of how a movie with a lot of special effects can be made without using a lot of cgi all of the bizarre scenes were created using good old fashioned tricks through manipulation of the camera set props editing or lighting eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is one of those films that people are either going to love or are going to hate i enjoyed the film immensely it stayed in my head for weeks both the story and filmmaking are inspiring but that 's just me maybe you 'll hate it if that 's the case you might want to visit lacuna the dvd includes an informative featurette explains how some of the best stuff in the movie was n't really scripted some deleted scenes a conversation with carrey and director michael gondry a lacuna infomercial a music video and a commentary
this is one of my favorite films of all time a man jim carrey in his career best performance finds out his ex had him erased from her memory so he sets out to do the same this is a powerful film that excels on all fronts acting direction sound and editing screenwriter charlie kaufman being john malkovich adaptation finally turns in a script that is as emotionally stirring as it is offbeat and intelligent
you almost ca n't put this movie completely together the first time you see it it takes the whole film to get it '' then the second time is amazing since i 've had the dvd i 've watched three or four times and each time i 'm blown away by the concept the visuals and the message best lines spoiler stuff clementine i 'm not a concept joel i 'm just a up girl who 's looking for my own peace of mind i 'm not perfect '' joel i do n't see anthing i do n't like about you '' clementine but you will you will think of things and i will get bored with you and feel trapped because that 's what happens with me '' joel okay '' clementine okay ''
eternal sunshine proves that there can still be originality in today 's hollywood charlie kaufman conquers the very difficult task of weaving an intricate touching tale about the complexities of love and how in a moment of anger or heartache we can take for granted our most precious memories and destroy the very best things experienced in life michel gondry and his team saw to it that every trick of the lens every visually stunning moment worked to enchance the heart of the story and therefore deserves every one of the five stars celebrating their celuloid triumph same goes for the actors who do such a beautiful job with their performances you 'd never know their characters came from words on a page jim carrey deserves special attention as his performance was an understated tour de force in my opinion as was kate winslet 's and the unlikely pairing making the story all the more surprising and enjoyable i recommend this be a film in everybody 's personal film library the message is universal and a story as well executed as this one will live on for generations never growing outdated or stale
this was absolutly brilliant ! if you 're a thinker or philosopher this movie is for you !
it 's true ! the more times i watch this movie the more i discover ! it 's like peeling an as each layer of skin comes off it reveals yet another layer and so is so much more than meets the eye each time around the story is centered on a couple jim carey and kate winslet who after 2 years together have a nasty arguement and winslet goes to a company that specializes in erasing unpleasant memories and has carey erased totally from her memory after he realizes what she has done he is too hurt to go on without her and he in turn has her erased during his procedure is where most of the movie takes carey 's unconcious mind the deeper they probe into his memories to erase her the more he realizes he really loves her and do n't want her erased unconscious though he is unable to stop them so begins a dillema in his mind to hide her in other parts of his memory and that is where the story gets so original ! ! ! as we see them mapping his brain on a scanner we see the couple running crazily from them through his literally ! we are also treated to other characters stories kirsten dunst mark ruffalo and elijah wood the staff at the company that does the erasing and thier characters add a lot of flavour to the movie too i seen another reviewer say that they kept track of time by her hair color which changes from one bizarre color to the next and that is also how i kept it skips in a lot but in a good way i just absolutely love this movie and loved seeing jim carey in such a serious role he is so awesome in this ! the only reason i only gave it 4 stars is that though it was directed good i think the directing could have been better i think we should have got to know them as a couple a little better before the break up not during the erasing procedure the first time i seen it i did n't really sympathize with carey while he was grieving toward the beginning of the i think some of thier closeness should have been revealed earlier on over all though this film is pure entertainment ! genious ! ! i will watch this movie over and over for years to come and always reccomend it to others
i have to confess i love nyc ! surely this feeling sustains an intense urge to watch the movies in which as much new york city as possible it is definitely being shared in common by millions nyc admirers worldwide and a very beginning of the movie does gratify viewers and from a very start scores a positive credit by gradually dismantling a panoramic picturesque icon of the big apple seen through a window of a approaching manhattan via brooklyn bridge from a dvd jacket 's summary prepared to see a next story of an american boy coming on age usually drugs fighting possible shooting girls some sex and car driving madness was surprised by a real context of a story about an art college student coming out of closet searching the right man while befriended by a mature at the time locally prominent impoverished writer having suddenly passed away in his room enchanted with homoerotic romantics this sad cheerful tale differs very much from of contemporary ny films such as for instance an musical rent '' near classical only in america '' tv serial sex in the city '' and even allen 's manhattan '' insight into ny lifestyle mix of histories occurred with nowadays civil right achievements limbo surrounding a main character played convincingly by mackie being mercilessly bushed and injected an unknown substance impress a viewer much although all actors those playing the young personages especially look very natural and relaxed one could suggest that oncoming years will bring about opportunities to create more movies and be remembered not only for recently really professionally performed scenes of an interracial sex
from the description on the dvd jacket i thought this was going to be a boring movie but i was wrong i was pleasantly surprised with the film i immediately cared about the main character anthony mackie there 's just something about him that made that role come alive i could feel him his anger and his pain he was n't flaming not that anything is wrong with that but he was just a man an honest black gay man the first intimate scene was exactly what i was expecting when i saw brokeback mountain but was disappointed with it was n't raw it was n't too much it was just enough this movie made it authentic but even more important than that were the 'flashbacks ' which really pulled me in and kept my attention it was wonderful to see the portrayals of langston hughes and zora neal hurston i 'd never even heard of fire '' magazine before interesting entertaining very creative and inspiring is what this film was the ending was slightly predictable at least to me but it did n't take away from the movie at all i 'd recommend it especially if you 're a lover of literature and the arts
this film as many have expressed was indeed wonderful it gave a convincing depiction of what it could be like being black and gay with the unnecessary confusion and apprehension linked with coming out '' the film depicts a young man who is already comfortable in his own skin and not struggling with his sexuality that was refreshing the acting was riveting and enthralling the historical portions the flash backs to the harlem renaissance was absolutely believable a part of me wished that perry 's played by anthony mackie and jim 's played by alex burns relationship could have worked out but that is the way life goes sometimes overall this film was enjoyable and it continues to reinforce my dislike for the big hollywood trash that is coming out these days
this touching drama lets you see how growing up gay has changed over two generations in the african american community in the united states i believe that this movie was one of the most under exposed looked movies of the year
i am not a movie buff but i enjoyed the movie as it was superbly entertaining i even watched the scenes that were cut from the movie and appreciated that the director took the time to do so he explored many avenues and hit the nail on the head with his chosen direction and we are all the better entertained for it i love history as well and got a kick out of the historic references the tender friendship stories with black faces was comforting to see
names we all recognize langston hughes zora lean hurston wally thurman but what is their connection to life in the 1920 's to life in harlem and their role in the rights movement and what is their role to us today rodney evans ' inspiring independent picture brother to brother '' atttempts to answer that question anthony mackie plays perry a young gay black artist struggling to find his place in this world and his own community supported unconditionally by his best friend marcus and another friend jim perry spends the early part of the film wandering around seemingly going through the motions but unsure of the meaning behind it all then he meets bruce nugent an aging artist and writer who attempts to guide perry through this tricky path of in doing so bruce illuminates his life back in the 1920 's in harlem during the grand renaissance when blacks unprecendentally began to blossom in all areas the film is the most effective in these moments of flashback an convention that works very well in this film as bruce tells his stories we see parts of harlem and the people who worked to buck conventions in trying to produce art that accurately reflected their authentic experience the actors playing the main people of bruce 's social set are incredible from daniel sunjata who plays langston hughes to aunjanue ellis who captures the zeal and life of zora neal hurston it is baudy risky and works to great effect as we see perry affected by these stories we as an audience are also equally affected this definitely has all of the hallmarks of an independent film adding a rawness of realism to the story rodney evans first work is a promising affecting tale one that reaches beyond race lines and will land deftly into your heart soon after watching brother to brother '' i found myself on amazon looking at the works of these people and ordering them for myself you will too as well as wanting to add this treasure of a movie into your collection
one of the best movies i 've seen lately it 's not so much the plot but a picture that is drawn in great detail and with affection it 's all about the encounter of a young gay artist and one of the last surviving writers of the harlem renaissance
brother to brother '' packs a lot of ambition into its compact running time director rodney evans has interwoven the story of perry a young gay artist anthony mackie living in new york struggling to find love and a sense of identity with nothing less than a brief film history of the birth of the harlem renaissance literary movement with its seminal figures langston hughes wallace thurman zora neale hurston and bruce nugent shown in flashbacks an aged destitute but still witty and unbowed nugent roger robinson befriends perry in the present and becomes his touchstone brother to brother '' is perhaps at its best in the flashbacks which vividly capture the excitement and sense of limitless possibility that briefly existed for nugent and his compatriots as they founded the radical literary journal fire ! '' they make one want to know more about these people the narrative has its virtues as well shedding light on the special problems of gay as well as the struggle to maintain one 's artistic identity and integrity the frankness with which sex is treated without prurience or heavy guilt is most welcome curiously as another reviewer has mentioned however the couplings shown almost exclusively involve black with white men which undercuts the film 's contention that black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness moreover evans ' protagonist has too many issues to contend with homophobic parents and classmates trying to make a living as a painter boyfriend troubles for everything to fit comfortably within the short allotted time finally it must be said that an actor with greater emotional range than mackie may have been able to bring out more facets of perry who too often seems merely a handsome glum cipher still despite its flaws brother to brother '' succeeds at illuminating corners of the human experience long neglected in mainstream filmmaking and for this certainly merits praise
i bought this dvd with some trepidation as some of the reviews i had seen had been less than complimentary on the whole but i was pleasantly surprised not only did i find the movie deeply engrossing and highly entertaining i also could n't fail to be moved by its in my view huge significance anthony mackie was truly mesmerizing and achingly beautiful to watch just the kind of black gay character i 'd been yearning to see on screen all my adult life he played the part with absolute conviction and thankfully he did this while managing to completely avoid any of the grotesque and stereotypical caricatures that we see oh so often in so many other gay parts i felt he played the part with a quiet and honest dignity and showed us a talented young black gay man who just wants to live and love i have no doubt that many black gay men will identify with him he is us and we are he the director made a point of stating makie 's heterosexuality in one of the bonus pieces but i feel his real sexuality is irrelevant straight gay or in between he 's a young black american actor with no doubt a long and successful career ahead of him taking on this role showed courage on his part and i take my hat off to him denzel and will take note roger robinson was a joy as well i 'd not seen either he or mackie prior to this and will be going in search of other works by these actors almost immediately she hate me '' which i had hitherto avoided and million dollar baby '' are first on my list i was also pleased to see larry gilliard jr and lance reddick in this movie after two seasons of the wire '' still waiting for season three on dvd i feel like they 're family great actors both of them the end was very poignant and the langston hughes poem that accompanied it very fitting i cried and yes it was unfortunate that all the black gay characters in the movie seemed keen on white men only in the light of marcus 's evil white men '' rants this aspect of the movie not to mention marcus 's later attempts to pimp perry off to a white soho art gallery owner seemed rather contradictory but all in all i thought the points around the issues of interracial relationships had been well made i look forward to future works by the director and all his leading actors male and female
a delightful based on the children 's classic by e nesbit 5 children are sent to spend the summer holidays during the first world war with their loopily obsessive uncle very well played by kenneth branagh some excellent set pieces such as when for example it '' the odd creature they discover on the magic beach succeeds in cloning the 5 children to perform the tedious household chores devised by their barmy uncle and some splendid clashes between the occasionally irritatingly sensible children and their nerdish overweight cousin i 'm sure if this film had been made in america more would have been made of the absent father fighting in the trenches who is only slantingly referred to in a rather sort of way but this is after all a british film and very faithful to the period
okay i will say that i 've never read the book although my 9 year old wants to after this movie ! we have watched movies every friday night for over 2 years 4 kids current ages 9 and 9 months and this is one of the best ones by far no questionable language at all and the sand fairy has some hilarious dry humor and comments but entirely appropriate for a kid 's movie it 's not rated which worried me at first i 'm still not sure why it did n't get a rating however i 'd say it 's a definate g '' there 's some scenes that younger kids might think is scary but is mostly suspense i really enjoyed the learning process the characters go through even if the characters were a little underdeveloped i thought for children they were decent actors yes there are a lot of similarities to narnia especially the opening of the film however if you enjoy each movie for what it is and not compare the two it 's very enjoyable as for the review that slams the graphics and audio we watched it on our 32 inch tv with no problems maybe he had an hdtv or something my daughter commented at one point how life like the sand fairy looked i do think a commentary or trailer would have been a nice touch but as for the movie itself it was one of the best we 've seen i do n't say this often but this time enjoy the movie first and then read the book
i must say that i was so pleasantly surprised by this movie my young daughter asked to rent it and not having read the book we did n't know what we were in for it captivated the imagination had great effects thanks to jim henson studios all the while showing how youthful siblings manage to handle each other while living without their parents and how innocently children can live in the midst of fear of losing their father in war it was not too serious if your children like fantasy without overdone drama and scary effects see this
i found this movie to be thoroughly fun and entertaining it had a great mix of whimsical mischief misguided wishes and an over all theme of the power of love and family i have not read the book and i most likely would be much more critical if i had a movie version of a book rarely does the book justice much to the disappointment of the fans of the book therefore i understand the criticism of those already established fans however for those of you who have not read the books i would highly recommend the movie i for one loved it
i recommend this clean movie which kept us all entertained ages 6 to 14 and mom as well we were so engrossed that we forgot to make popcorn ! first a caveat if you recently saw narnia you might think the movie is copying '' two boys and two girls and their toddler brother are sent to an uncle 's house in the country as their mother is a ww 1 nurse and their dad is a fighter pilot there are similar issues the older brother in charge '' and the younger brother not happy about it but the stories are n't copies of one another and did n't intend to be ! they are both just movies of really good children 's books we are big fans of nesbitt and were a bit dubious about seeing this movie as to staying true to the original novel there are liberalities however there are a number of scenes which are similar and some which are just for the movie the psammead sand fairy makes some amusing comments but thankfully none of his jokes or anyone else 's descend into that crude humor which is so prevalent in children 's movies today yes the acting is a bit weak the kids seem to always have smiles on their faces for some reason and the girls are n't developed very well as characters and i never really enjoy talking puppets in my movies but with all that said we still enjoyed the movie quite a bit
y'know i do n't care what anyone else says 'bout this film i liked it so there g it was a good bit of childish fun at times as well as a lot of drama i cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war it 's got funny stuff with the cousin and it '' which eddie voices ever so brilliantly and i loved the i knew she was something special siding with the children and helping them i loved her ! kenneth brannagh was hilarious as well i do n't know i just loved it i think you should give it a dry i think it 's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like cs lewis or even tolkien at times the moral of the story wishes ca n't last forever but you 'll just have to see the movie to see what i 'm talking about now wo n't you
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids and quite possibly yourself entertained during an holiday i laughed i cried really i did and i just really enjoyed it
this is another film based on a philip dick story spencer olham gary sinise portrays a weapon 's designer the year is 2079 and earth is at war with an alien race called the centauri hathaway vincent d'onofrio portrays an agent with esa earth security agency in the film this future world of ours is protected by a structure to help deter attacks by the centauri however the centauri have become devious in this war for instance the centauri use human clones who do not know they are clones about to discharge on a selected que but real humans typical and great dick theme of altered reality maya olham madeline stowe portrays spencer 's wife she works at a hospital treating the wounded soldiers fighting this war and her role in the film is extremely important when spencer returns to work he finds himself being accused of being one these destructive devices about to detonate when his time is ready the clones are programmed to detonate on a certain que while he is about to be tortured by hathaway spencer frees himself and sets about to prove that he is innocent and not the centauri robot he is accused of being there is a good mystery element in the film although we never see the centauri other than their warships blasting at earths protective shield the film 's focus is mainly on the identity of a man and his attempts to prove himself innocent this is a very effective film i will not give away the film 's ending and although this film follows a typical dick ending in its resolution it is still surprising nonetheless the film is action paced and the supporting roles of d'onofrio as the agent in pursuit of spencer sinise and maya stowe as spencer 's wife are great highly recommended you will enjoy it especially if you are a fan of philip dick stars 4.5
i had never heard of this film until i rented it then purchased it after watching originally it was to be a 40 minute film tied together with 2 others to make one giant film about the relationship between humans and aliens the story was then expanded upon to make it a feature all by itself the story taken from an excellent short story from philip k dick involves a not to distant future earth at war with an alien race we never really see earth cities are protected by domes as the aliens seek a way to get to us this leads to a paranoid society trying to do anything to protect itself sinise is excellent in his role as he takes us on one adventure after another as he tries to prove to the authorities that he is not an alien plant the twist ending was also a plus for the movie the pciture is not perfect and the extras suck but this one is a good watch
lets keep this short i 'm not writing a novel just giving my opinion first off this movie was very enjoyable keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish there was n't one slow or dull moment which is always a plus for sci fi movies it was filled with intense action along with a solid story there were a few twists thrown in too overall i 'd recommend impostor to any sc fi buff who loves futuristic elements society lifestyles and my favorite gadgets
the author was not your classic story teller he streched the boundaries of the genre with each new publication and it is a shame that he was not as popular living as he is now his tales had a spooky this is not happening quality that is only rarely visible on film the movie is based on the novel with some cinematic licenses thrown in it does not have little green men ordering us to surrender or else what is does have is gary sinise and madeline stowe husband and wife lovers and friends caught in a mad future of alien wars and an increasingly totalitarian society sinise is with the authorities when he is capture and told that he is not who he thinks he is but is instead an alien creation made to resemble his old self in all ways the inquisitor was perfect as the bureaucrat with a mission determined and relentless the majority of the film involves sinise his escape from the authorities and his battle to prove he is not an alien creature the ending totally unexpected hits hard and stuns things do not always work out for the best and the good guy does not always win stowe and sinise were near perfect in their edginess in this nameless timeless existence of which the viewer gets a small slice it is intentionally murky think twelve monkeys '' yet the viewer feels the anguish pain and frustration
there is something insidious about a pkd plot many of them lend themselves to movie adaptation for instance do androids dream of electric sheep blade runner we can remember it for you wholesale total recall and of course minority report it 's been 30 years since i read the story but it was still pretty fresh in my mind the script seems to stick pretty close to what pkd wrote and that may be the problem it distresses me to admit that a movie can go wrong by being too faithful to the story on which it is based but that seems to have happened here the lack of insight into the protagonist 's feelings and thought processes limits the empathy you can feel for him so the plot ends up as a kind of telescoped futuristic the fugitive '' gary sinise does what he can with the lead role with madeleine stowe even more muted as his wife the two most colourful characters are vincent d'onofrio as the ambivalent major hathaway of security and mekhi phifer as the streetwise cale bottom line this is a story set in 2075 but written in about 1960 and that harms its credibility our surveillance techniques today are just about as good as those in impostor surely a dictatorship locked in a struggle with merciless aliens 70 years in the future could do better when it comes to tracking a runaway perhaps a little more explanation and less action would have helped when all is said and done it 's still a pleasure to follow the precise mechanism of pkd 's scenario as it works itself out
love story meets dark comedy cameron diaz said it best in there 's something about mary '' harold and maude is the greatest love story of all time the story is great the humor priceless and the soundtrack is fabulous
after watching this movie one friday night i immediately watched it again did i just see that '' was my initial reaction a fantastic film that sticks with you for weeks initially rented from a local blockbuster before purchasing it via amazon i watched it over 6 times before returning it back i loved the cat stevens soundtrack and it makes me sad that there is no harold and maude soundtrack that has all of the songs especially tea for the tillerman '' you appreciate the brilliant directing and although it has been considered creepy '' it is never truly unsettling but rather it makes you examine how you add value to life and for myself created ways to be !
on the face of it a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a attachment to an ancient woman seems about as niche '' as you can get but do n't overlook this film the relationship between harold and maude is truly endearing and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic through maude ruth gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit we get a truly unique perspective on life told in such a gracefully sweet way that we can not help but fall in love with her if you like igby goes down a modern interpretation of catcher in the rye you 'll get much the same feeling from harold and maude which is not so much a coming of age '' movie as a look at love in all its splendours
prior to vhs or dvd back in when movie theaters remember those the ones where it was only 1 for two films and a short and the films were shown in big theaters so what if the sound was n't dolby or dts films were still films not just 1 of 10 stock plots enhanced by computer special effects well this film was so absolutely brilliant and profound innocent and ageless that i saw it every time it was advertised in the newspaper '' in the movie section i believe i lost count at around 75 now with the dvd in my closet it just is not watched as mcuh but remains for times when it is necessary to remember that people are really alive and giving souls whether they represent the protagonist or antagonist give me an l '' give me an i '' give me a v '' give me an e '' l i v e live ! else you 've got nothin ' to talk about in the locker room '' a hint to the seeing of this work of art '' allow no preconceptions of what it will be or what it is just let it be observe without judgement and you will know
this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it does n't feel as audacious as i 'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all love stories as a old depressive connects with a old woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play '' and nine to five '' allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters ' actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of cynicism it 's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold 's mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens ' soundtrack has n't aged as well as say simon and garfunkel 's music in the graduate '' but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included
people who watch this movie either love it or hate it
harold and maude is simply the most joyful movie i have ever seen not only is it funny it is touching and moving and odd if you have n't seen it in a while see it again
i love this movie so much i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance i know so random when i was in my teens i went out and rented it right away and i have watched it about 100 times since then i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon it 's such a sweet touching story it 's a bit off the wall but that 's of course what i love about it
harold and maude '' is one of those movies that 's hard to categorize it 's a black comedy an offbeat romance and a little morality play all in one there are some really hilarious scenes my favorite is the part where h m outwit harold 's uncle a crazed militarist and also some touching scenes between the two protagonists i ca n't quite give this movie five stars however for several reasons first the production quality is mediocre at best second while maude 's antics are amusing at a distance she 's not really all that loveable a lot of her advice '' seems too much like late do what feels good '' drivel apparently it 's ok to steal cars if you 're 79 years old the cat stevens songs are often intrusive and annoying and finally the scene with h m in bed presumably after having sex is just creepy
the aids situation is far greater than we are told corruption in africa is horrific the situation is beyond any horror film 's scare anytime this film of lecarre 's novel bears great importance to our future our destiny one of the most important films ever made ! actors like ralph fiennes rachel weitz need more commendation for it and director fernando merelles is a genius agripping thriller for the serious 50 stars
the constant gardener is an interesting case of strong direction and performances managing to paper over plot holes and some serious lapses in credibility it 's hard to imagine the two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but in a writer 's wishful thinking and the investigation into drugs ' companies faking trials in africa relies perhaps too heavily on slips of the tongue or the odd incriminating document or conversation yet between the edgy but genuinely energetic direction the better performances and the subject matter it 's surprisingly powerful and involving and definitely one of the best john le carre adaptations perfectly cast ralph fiennes and rachel weisz 's limitations work for the roles for once his awkward shtick and her head girl act are as right here as they are irritating in too many other films not all the casting or performances are as good however with bill nighy showing again why he 's better in light comedy than in straight drama danny huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them and fully inhabiting his pathetic role as a spineless lovestruck embassy official the accent seems a little too affected at first before wearing in well worth investigating
this movie is a thought provoking exercise in conspiracy and reality drenched fiction it is a story that could well have been headlines all over the world the journey of an activist in africa can easily be frought with danger exposing a conspicacy that compromises public health is a powerful subject one mans quest to uncover the truth and honor his dearly departed partner is a moving trip through the twists and turns of a complicated crime the coverup is something that could easily happen in real life it would n't be the first time that corporate greed compromised the public good while there is heartfelt vindication in the movies conclusion it is still sad there is no happy ending or lasting satisfaction but it is a grim reminder that courage no matter how worthwhile can get you killed in the modern world the value of human life is something that powerful people denigrate on a daily basis it is hoepful that this movie will strike a chord in the minds of the public opinion question all motives at all times keep a vigil out for the sick and helpless sometimes a crisis in underdeveloped countries will go on festering for years it is on our watch that people everywhere should have someone to count on when there is a crisis the world owes those less fortunate to have a helping hand extended towards them this one man teaches a lesson we should never forget always question those in power and hold them accountable activism is a altruistic crusade that is much needed and deeply appreciated this movie makes you remember that and is must see viewing it is a sad reminder of what can go wrong in the modern world if only there was retribution more often in the real world for those who live in countries they have much to be thankful for and much to be expected of them only when widespread disease and hunger are eradicated can we call this a civilized world always be suspicious of those that profit from the plight of the poor man and never give up in the quest for truth and justice

these are the issues that are explored in this film directed by alan pakula adapted from the best selling novel by scott turow it is the story of chief deputy prosecutor rozat rusty '' sabich ford in the fictional kindle county whose seemingly normal life is shattered by the murder of a female colleague carolyn polhemus scacchi a colleague with whom he had previously engaged in an affair and whom he had stalked when she had broken off the affair any illusions you may have about the integrity of the criminal justice system in this fictional world are swept away quickly sabich is coerced into heading the investigation of polhemus ' murder by his boss prosecuting attorney raymond horgan dennehy that is until horgan loses his reelection campaign and new prosecuting attorney nico della guardia mardirosian and his second whip tommy molto grifasi charge him with polhemus ' murder one of the great aspects of this movie is that sabich while heading the murder investigation seems very conflicted about his previous encounters with polhemus who we only see in flashback sequences during the film we do n't know if this is because of his emotional and sexual connection to polhemus or because he is the murderer himself suspicions are raised concerning sabich 's guilt throughout the first third of the movie his obstruction of his lead investigator detective lipranzer spencer by ignoring fingerprint evidence this becomes ammunition against him later when he becomes the defendant sabich 's wife barbara bedelia throws gasoline on the fire by constantly nettling rusty about the previous affair and most important rusty 's obsession with polhemus which even her death could not end barbara tries to reconnect to rusty during the movie but it is clear that he deeply hurt her by the affair and rusty knows that he has a lot to atone for the net starts closing around sabich fairly quickly in the second third of the movie everyone except lipranzer is ready and willing to believe that sabich is the murderer luckily sabich hires former adversary sandy stern julia to defend him stern is an outstanding defense attorney and his instincts eventually lead to a winning strategy that results in the dismissal of charges against sabich but as stern asks sabich later in the film was justice done '' the forensic case that is prepared against sabich is interesting because it predates the active use of dna in criminal investigations also the actions of the medical examiner painless '' kumagai shimono alternate between the comical and ridiculous nevertheless the trial that is the centerpiece of the movie is truly engrossing the trial judge larren lyttle winfield is quite amusing and speaks his mind what we come to realize by the middle of the film is that political intrigue blackmail and sex influence in the film anyone even tangentially involved in the case is dirty in some respect no one is innocent although you may guess the true identity of the murderer before the trial ends i promise you will never forget the speech delivered in the denouement of the film as sabich says in the final minute of the film there was a crime there was a victim and there punishment '' the john williams score is quite haunting and will stay with you for some time all of the principal actors ford bedelia julia winfield spencer mardirosian dennehy grifasi deliver powerful performances as a bit of trivia mardirosian and grifasi later had guest appearances in the second season of a fledging tv series named law order julia showed that he could play a serious role unlike other roles in street fighter and addams family as a previous reviewer noted julia should have garnered an oscar for best supporting actor as his performance carries the film from the second act forward buy this movie and appreciate its subtleties with a second and third viewing i promise you wo n't be disappointed except of course by the lack of extras such as director commentary on the dvd maybe one day a collector 's edition will be released
while presumed innocent is competent filmmaking one ca n't help but look at the star system '' and see how a talented actress like bonnie bedelia is relegated to merely a talented actress and not a star had this role been taken by meryl streep jessica lange sally field or numerous other stars the direction on bedelia 's pivotal speech would have enabled the viewer to see more of her delivery than the reaction of star '' harrison ford this is truly a shame as bedelia is riveting in her performance of ford 's wronged wife ford himself is competent but his annoying sneer is a little too forced brian dennehy raul julia and paul winfield are very good too and the adaptation of scott turow 's complex novel is well thought out and executed a taut and intense thriller nonetheless
this movie has much to commend it where to start first it 's based on a great book a in its own right second great casting and acting from top to bottom harrison ford is at the top of his game perfect in his range of emotions and fitting into the role so well you have to struggle to remember he 's acting likewise bonnie bedelia is a terrific actress my generation mainly thinks of her as john mcclane 's wife in die hard i and ii bring her back for iv ! and my parents ' generation thinks of her as ruby in they shoot horses do n't they '' but we all need to see her in this role where she shines in her ability i also must commend the penultimate scene of the movie bonnie bedelia 's the destroyer is destroyed '' monologue wow what a speech ! what a perfect reaction from rusty sabich ! gasping saved '' sometimes one or two scenes make a movie think for example of the and the scenes in true romance '' sometimes however a movie that is otherwise strong in all its parts is made even stronger by a certain scene presumed innocent '' is such a movie and bedelia 's monologue is just such a scene this movie is definitely worth purchasing for your home collection
putting it simply this film is the work of a genius as a tom stoppard fanatic i adored it from the moment i read the play which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with he was significantly more satisfied with the movie and there is very little doubt as to why he clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working any being who has ever had a single existentialist thought should see this film they may or may not like it but that 's not what matters this film is amazing
a little cerebral and a little slapstick and all shakespeare it is how shakespeare would have written the story of hamlets friends
this is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something but those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most films of all time there is n't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the crowd but it has some of the best acting serious and comic writing imagery of any film you 're likely to come across
i have to admit this movie can be slow and strange hence minus 1 star but to me and this is just to me i was able to pay attention because of gary oldman who is my all time 1 favorite actor he 's such a chameleon and seeing as how he usually graces the screen as a bad guy in some way shape or form or is just eccentric or crazy lol he 's just brilliantly funny in this it 's interesting gary 's character as 'rosencrantz ' not guildenstern lol is a 'slow ' fella but he 's imaginative inventive but philosophical once he gets a grasp on what you 're talking about then to top it all off you 're thrust into hamlet but from another perspective so you got ta get into the shakespearian linguo which i have n't done fully since grade and that was 6 years ago fortunately ros guild hardly have to talk in such a strange manner or as thickly as the other regular hamlet characters do it 's just worded strangely it 's like they 're poets the chemistry between roth oldman is wonderful and the extra 's are interviews with dreyfus oldman roth stoppard himself then they also have a photo gallery that 's it but for me it was enough to hear oldman talk for 58 minutes ! SMILE they 're interviewed separately the dvd i got came with 2 discs i suppose this is the only release to dvd so far so they all will be 2 disc quality was very good SMILE if you 're a big fan of gary 's i highly recommend this flick very amusing and interesting and good shakespearian fun
this is a work of genius it is creative original funny and well done that being said it is probably not for everyone this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare 's hamlet these are the stars of the show in hamlet they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet 's melancholia they appear briefly and are gone the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince in this work the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them as they discuss existential questions the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them it is quite funny but some background helps it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style it helps if you are familiar with hamlet that makes understanding the context easier it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn it 's is fun
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it would be an excellent addition to any library where one would find other film adaptations of shakespeares works it does help to have an idea of hamlet and i would recommend reading or watching any version of it before this film or you can get a bit lost it gives a new spin to the play and makes you see the play through the eyes of two of the minor players rosencrantz and guildenstern however it is nonetheless an enjoyable film and will only add to your enjoyment and understanding of hamlet
just because you are paranoid does not mean they are not out to get you the title says it all and you have seen it a million times you have to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are shades of the bourn identity '' appear as jerry fletcher mel gibson must find out not only who they are but also who he is and will alice sutton julia roberts believe him or not or is she the bad guy or a target aside from the plot is powerful acting by powerful actors how do they handle trust
quite obviously this movie did n't get any oscars but then again if you 're watching this kind of movie you 're not expecting oscar material the plot was slightly above par the not so much but this movie was fun personally i think it should have been in theaters longer it 's no worse then any other teen horror movie that was out at that time remember the travesty that was i still know what you did last summer '' and i believe it could have done reasonably well so if you 're looking for a fun movie and not an oscar winner you ca n't go wrong here also the commentary is hysterical i 'd but the dvd just for that
i have to admit that i normally take my nephews to see all these movies however we had skipped this one because we were told it was a madagascar '' and we did n't really find madagascar '' very funny on a whim i bought a copy when the movie was released to dvd and we love it ! the story was much more appropriate for kids then madagascar '' and much funnier ! we loved the soundtrack bought that too and for anyone who loves eddie izzard he was even funnier then in concert hearing that comic timing and remarks coming from a koala was priceless look i 'm a starfish ! ''
verry nice movie we like it and love to have more of these movies we like to see more dancing of the animals and have some more songs in it
samson keifer sutherland and his son ryan greg cipes live a comfortable life in the new york zoo they stay in their enclosure during the day but at night they have the run of the zoo hang out and even play games with their friends ryan has a problem however he has n't developed his roar samson has told him lots of stories about his life in the wild '' but they are n't helping ryan every time he tries it sounds more like a cat then a lion fed up with not meeting his dad 's expectations he decides to stow away in a crate bound for africa at the last minute samson discovers what 's going on and sets out to rescue his son helping him in his quest are benny the squirrel jim belushi nigel the koala bear eddie izzard bridget the giraffe janeane garofalo and larry the snake richard kind their quest takes them from the streets to new york to an island off the coast of africa along the way samson 's secret will be revealed and the gang will face a volcano and a dangerous pack of wildebeests led by kazar william shatner unfortunately i missed this movie in the theaters the movie is absolutely hysterical i watched it with a couple friends and the three of us laughed the entire way through yes there are some absurd situations but most of the humor comes from the snappy dialog the jokes are quick and it takes a couple watches to get them all the movie has been compared to dreamworks 's madagascar but i did n't see it what i can tell you is while this movie has some familiar plots it kept me entertained from start to finish with a couple twists along the way the actors do a great job with the characters and the animation is top notch i am truly sorry i missed this gem on the big screen but am glad i bought it i 'll be enjoying this one for years to come
it does n't take a movie critic to realize that there are several similarities to the movie madagascar ! as another review so clearly points out i too think there are only so many subjects one can make a movie about and maintain some level of appeal to the masses this movie was mainly purchased for the viewing and enjoyment of my two young nieces and i was delighted that it kept them entertained they have very strong opinions and are quite capable of expressing their displeasure but did n't complain about the movies subject matter therefore i am a satisfied customer overall i would have to say this movie scores well with me and i would recommend it to others
in the post wwii environment of japan the line between becoming a criminal and a cop was a very thin one the prospect of upholding any myths or nationalistic fervor must have been slim for soldiers returning home after a brutal war one which ended in the most barbaric of ways and effectively castrated and humiliated a proud and rigid culture a lifetime of pride in your homeland could evaporate as quickly as a backpack being stolen in stray dog master kurosawa wastes no time in setting up the film 's one story line that of rookie detective murakami who on a sweltering and packed bus loses his gun for the new detective a former soldier the transition between war and domestic soldiering proves the mettle of the film and the depth of it 's story comes in that difficult place unfamiliar with procedure departments as well as the 's of tokyo 's underworld the search for his strength his pride his manhood will define him make him or break him with the dogged leadership of veteran cop sato murakami 's mentor in this pursuit he recognizes the significance of his position seeing himself and perhaps allowing for hope in a fractured society toshiro mifune legend is murakami frazzled humiliated frequently an emotive wreck though an early sequence in which he goes undercover as a soldier to search out black market long sequence that is completely without beautiful and powerful in it 's exposure of the seamy world of desperate people stray dogs '' who suffer the dregs of a crowded uncomfortable world takashi shimura is sato the other lead and his presence is a strong calming one as the knowing cop the rudder perhaps to murakami 's windy sail an interesting deep cop film it is very stylish naturalistically made and acted though it 's print is visibly aged it 's shadows seem to be less sharp than a noir allowing for the light to get in
this early akira kurosawa film is outstanding what captivated me about this early kurosawa film was the way in which he allows us to see japan it is truly remarkable that we are seeing the streets that just a few years before were being laid to waste by massive bombings the character played by toshiro mifune is also a great glimpse into what will become one of the greatest actors ever to come out of japan and there is the presence of my favorite japanese actor takashi shimura and with shimura guiding the young mifune through the maze of police work and suggestions on how to proceed with his obsession in finding his missing stolen handgun we see a wonderful study in character development in this early kurosawa classic criterion did a wonderful transfer with this film this is a truly great classic just looking at japan itself is a cinematic masterpiece highly recommended
akira kurosawa 's 1949 film noir stray dog '' is a gritty crime drama shot on the streets of a sweltering post tokyo young homicide detective murakami played by a youthful toshiro mifune has his colt service revolver pilfered from his pocket on a crowded bus unable to catch the thief after a futile chase he returns back to the station in self imposed shame his superior suggests that he go out on the streets and interview known pickpockets for insight into the stolen gun market mifune wanders the streets in disguise trying to procure clues at this juncture director kurosawa does an excellent job giving us a view of the late 40 's japanese society it 's decimation and subsequent attempt at reconstruction is portrayed quite effectively as mifune skulks through the decadent underbelly of the criminal element after his investigation stalls he partners with veteran officer sato played by takashi shimura shimura acts as a voice of reason to the despondent mifune after they learn that his gun has been used for a series of crimes one involving a murder of a young woman mifune and shimura discover that the gun has wound up in the hands of a criminal named yusa they learn of his habits and haunts through his dance hall girlfriend sato confronts him at a hotel he 's been quartered out and winds up getting shot mifune feeling grief and guilt over sato 's plight is now ready to crack from the violence spawned by his stolen weapon he learns of yusa 's whereabouts and has a confrontation with him where he is shot but finally apprehends the elusive criminal we see the maturation of mifune as a law enforcement officer as he is schooled by the wise sato who thankfully survives his wounds kurosawa uses his film to depict the fragility of the redeveloping japanese society after it 's upheaval following the war years
stray dog '' is a story about a japanese veteran who comes home to a destroyed world after many veterans returning home today could probably relate director kurosawa did a magnificent job relating a world in total colapse and illustrating the strugle that everday people had to go through to survive and go on living being a history buff i found the scenes of life in japan after the war to be very enlightening
actually i give this 3 stars i 'm a big fan but the extremely slow start of this movie really took it down a notch or two i thought the expository monologue in the beginning was rather dissapointing i would have expected kurosawa to just show '' that happening rather than have it explained to you also the sequence with murakami mifune walking through the rough parts of tokyo was a bit longer than it had to be the footage was very interesting but it just seemed to slow the pace of the movie down to a crawl however once murakami picks up the trail of his stolen firearm the pace pf the movie picks up as well you could feel the atmosphere of sweltering heat as murakami and sato shimura make their way through the investigation it 's also interesting how sato has a view of the criminal mind whereas murakami can see the shades of grey for murakami not all criminals are just bad people '' sometimes they 're just average folks pushed to the edge by harsh circumstances both murakami and the man he is pursuing have had similar experiences yet both men made completely different choices when they found themselves at a crossroads this is a fascinating story about despair choices and consequence any collaboration is worth checking out while this one does n't measure up to others quite as well it 's still worth a look lastly criterion did an excellent job with this movie great transfer good subtitles commentary a 32 minute documentary and great interactive menus all brought to you in a very handsome package a great buy for those who want more bang for their buck in their dvds
knowing that stray dog '' was a movie by akira kurosawa gave me high expections and i was not disappointed the movie starts out as a sort of beaurocratic comedy as a plain clothes officer named murakami has his pistol stolen by a pick pocket despite the embarassment it was a matter that could affect his continued employment with the force as he starts to track down which pickpocket might have done the job it becomes apparent that the gun has been used in a violent crime at this point the officer gets teamed up with an old pro named sato and the two are on the hunt for a serious criminal the plot may sound but as in most kurosawa movies i 've seen the excellence is n't in the story but in its ' telling there are several scenes of murakami wandering through tokyo that reminded me somewhat of the bicycle thief '' there is a lot of psychological aspects to this movie such as murakami 's efforts to reconcile the use of his gun in the hands of a violent criminal in the conversations between the two detectives we hear the hardened outlook of sato on the criminal element in society murakami shows the occassional fine line between cop and thief which may have been kurosawa 's main point in stray dog '' there are many other interesting aspects to the movie and i 'm sure more will emerge each time i see it the movie has the added aspect of being a fairly good thriller toshiro mifune plays murakami and it seemed strange to see him clean cut throughout the movie takashi shimura plays sato and the two work very well together all of the acting is well done as well as the directing and the writing kurosawa shows in stray dog '' that he is as comfortable in the present as he is in the past
rookie homicide detective toshiro mifune has his gun stolen agonized with guilt mifune goes out in search of his gun day and night he pounds the crowded streets of tokyo until he learns that his gun is being used by a mad dog '' that is growing increasingly violent with each crime mifune must stop him this was my first kurosawa film so i ca n't really compare it to his others but i thought stray dog was very well made the script was well paced the acting made me smile and the camerawork left in in awe i actually paused the film a few times just to look at the beautiful image on the screen the movie is also intriguing thanks to it 's realism and use of actual locations in showing japanese life after wwii inoshiro honda godzilla had to secretly shoot the sequences of black markets and flophouses cause they were real
released in movie stars toshiro mifune in one of his earliest roles as tokyo cop murakami who 's gun is stolen which leads to his relentless drive to recover the is being used in a crime spree we actually see very little of man who winds up with the gun and i 'm not totally convinced that the use of the name was not coincidental considering japan was occupied by the at the time perhaps mifunes attempt to retrieve the missing gun and restore his honor is symbolic of japans attempt to restore it 's honor after the war then may be reading into this and it may not be any such thing however kurosawa regard to problems with the american spca and this movie stated i never at any other moment experienced a stronger sense of regret over japan 's losing the war '' regerdless as in other films such as madadayo '' and rhapsody in august '' touched on the conflict and the atomic not implying that he was i thnk it 's a possibility that yusa could have had symbolic meaning that theory aside this is an excellent is preserved quite well considering it 's age and the conditions when it was filmed when neither mifune or kurosawa were major stars and japan was still recovering from the war while mifune is my favorite actor i 'm so used to him playing a samurai that this role took a little getting used to but his performance is quite one would expect ! basically this story revolves around murakami mifune who is mentored by sato takashi shimura and their pursuit of the missing gun and yusa isao kimura if nothing film is fascinating for it 's historical presentation of post war japan any fans should enjoy this movie ! while quite more recent movie with the same basic premise which is very good is the missing gun
a seminal film it has been ripped off several times that shows the first unmistakable signs of kurosawa 's genius drawing on american gangster flicks and the existentialist crime novels of simenon kurosawa weaves in his own special concerns the brutalizing effect of wartime japan 's military dictatorship the corrupting effect of postwar japan 's crony capitalism to create a taut intelligent thriller with subtle overtones setting tokyo summer of 1949. young cop mifune has his gun lifted on a crowded bus and now a stray dog '' a former soldier turned street thug is using it in a crime spree mifune pairs up with wise mentor takashi shimura seven samurai ikiru to track down the stray dog before he kills again a classic montage shows undercover mifune actually a stunt double roaming the actual back alleys of early postwar tokyo 's thriving black market this famous scene was shot using a hidden camera revealing hordes of hungry grubby unemployed former soldiers hanging around street corners and obviously up to no good gritty realism is the keynote stray dog is the only movie i 've seen that accurately depicts a tokyo summer everyone packed together and sweating profusely a constant fanning of faces and mopping of brows in japan 's stiflingly humid climate the steamy suffocating heat becomes an objective correlative for the frustration and hopelessness that gripped the recently defeated nation before the economic miracle arrived lots of wonderful stuff in this film the great montage sequences rare in kurasawa 's oeuvre the clever tracking shots the masterly pacing the elegant construction the and the subtle incremental way the stray dog is revealed to us the brilliant use of ambient sounds and music that mozart piano sonata wafting from an open window during the big showdown and much else the only fault i can find with kurosawa 's directing here is an overlong baseball sequence in the middle of the film but even this scene has a certain quaint quality to it at least for me it does the transfer quality is pretty good for a film this old not nearly as spectacular as the pristine transfer that criterion did for hidden fortress but certainly more than adequate you work with what you 've got i guess extras include a documentary containing interviews with kurosawa and a couple of the stars of stray dog plus a superb commentary by film scholar stephen prince that 's worth the price of disc all by itself unlike other great japanese directors who stuck to one genre and refined it over the course of their careers kurosawa was a restless genius and a master of many genres film noir samurai epics samurai comedies domestic dramas political thrillers social realism surrealism etc there were brief glimpses of this genius in his earlier films but it all starts to come together here in 1949. a year later he released the masterpiece rashomon and his status as a cinematic giant was assured
many of the other reviews have summarized akira kurosawa 's excellent film so i wo n't recap it since you are probably familiar with the seven samurai rather if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release rest easy it is well worth the price having seen the movie many many times i was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details i had missed the supplemental materials commentaries documentaries interviews and the booklet with reminiscences from mifune toshiro complement the movie nicely if you are on the fence go ahead and buy it this dvd is worth it
thank you criterion i just finished watching the new 3 dvd set and it is wonderful ! the movie itself has been beautifully restored as only criterion can the sound is also very well done are not enough wonderful things i can say about the job they did on this film the third disc is a treat it was very interesting watching the interview with akira the back ground on the movie and the rare trailers were a terrific new addition for this release bravo ! i cant wait for more
i 've owned the original criterion version of seven samurai it was nice owning this fantastic movie especially since it had the criterion stamp when the new version came out i read numerous reviews stating how much of an improvement it was from the first edition and i am in full agreement i 've never written a review for before but i feel compelled because of how impressed i am with these dvds criterion has really cleaned up this new version it blows the older version away it looks like it was filmed yesterday the extras are really awesome and the booklet is nice and informative this is the definitive edition of this wonderful movie and kurosawa 's masterpiece well worth the money
akira kurosawa 's masterpiece gets the ' from criterion this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film absolutely no question about it i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras let alone watch the movie all the way through i 'm one of those viewers i have seen the film several times over the years mostly on criterion 's original release of the film this is going way back if you have never seen this film do n't waste your time with any other version than this one it does not disappoint kydu
this film only gets better to me with every viewing and now with this great new release from criterion i can see it in an even clearer light a great transfer accompanied by fantastic extras that give you insight and information on this film that is hard to find elsewhere it 's like seven samurai film school in a box there will never be another release to top this one and probably never another film a must have for kurosawa and film fans
i picked this one up mostly because i wanted to see why directors like sergio leone and george lucas were inspired by this film it 's easy to see why this is an epic in the same vien as the last samuri '' only it is conciderably better and lacks tom cruise which is a good thing the battles and fight scenes are wonderful the wet muddy battles looked great on a very nice dvd transfer the picture looked pretty damn good i usually am not a huge forien film fan and i do n't usually like subtitles but this movie was so good that non of that bothered me if you liked the american version of this film the magnificent seven ' i deffinetly recomend this an all time great
the seven samurai was the basis for that wonderful western the magnificient seven but is in every way a superior movie the lighting the camera angles and acting are all first class the director is brilliant enjoy this treasure
seven samurai is really the greatest story ever told ! i wo n't go into why here because there are plenty of reviewers both here and elsewhere on the internet who do a much better job than i ever could this brand new criterion reissue that improves on the older one in every way so you have no excuse not to buy it right now
since there are over 300 reviews of this magnificent film already posted i would like to discuss some aspects of this film that are rarely discussed the first of these two themes is the various roles and attributes of the heroic male the second of the two themes is the depiction of classism and a stratified society however before i comment on these two themes i must praise kurosawa the director for the incredible battle scenes the level of realism chaos and accident is very high giving the viewer a superb look into battle as the layout of the village is drawn and repeatedly shown to the viewer in kambei 's maps we fully understand the battleground and the rationale for defending specific sites and barrocading others we understand kambei 's master strategy and its execution we understand when it goes wrong or astray and we watch kambei immediate correct the situation if possible we see beserk men hacking at each other rather than an over stylized ballet posing as a battle scene these battle scenes are masterful and rare that being said i would like to discuss the two themes i outlined above first we see three distinct ways or paths of the hero in this film we see the character kyuzo the master swordsman a completely skilled killing machine swift as a scorpion and calm as a cool breeze he is a craftsman sure of his talent and skill he is also serene having obviously attained a detachment from emotion and worries he takes his skill seriously as seen in his first scene where a dueling partner progresses from sticks to swords and kyuzo kills him within seconds a second revealing scene is the great sequence where wildman kikuchoiyo and kyuzo become a team to track and kill the three bandit scouts the third scene is wisely left to our immagination kyuzo learns that three of the bandits hidden in the forrest around the village has a rifle kyuzo leaves the compound alone in the fog of night and many hours later returns with a rifle in hand he hands the rifle to kambei and goes calmly to sleep we see that kyuzo though a self contained killing machine can work in partnership with a wildly unpredictable partner as well as follow instructions from the wise leader kambei kyuzo is seen in all cultures and in all times he is the totally proficient warrior he is the warrior that all younger warriors wish to emulate but he is incomplete because he lacks one virtue purpose beyond himself yet he is wise enough to be persuaded by kambei and to follow kambei 's wise direction it is purposefully ironic that kyuzo is shot in the back by one of the three rifles in the film since no one can beat him face to face with sword technology the character of kikuchoiyo the wild man who wishes to become a samurai the man who can not contain his energy or emotion the force of nature is an incredible character he is the exact opposite of kyuzo the serene killing machine he has little control of his emotions is spontaneous and rage driven yet his character undergoes the most transformation in the film he goes from being a lying drunken bully imposter to a force of great good primarily through the strategic hands off mentoring of kambei we learn that he is not from a samurai family but is the orphan of farmers killed by bandits kikuchoiyo first gives us a hint as to his background when he informs the samurai that farmers always have hidden resources on which to call this secrecy being necessary for thier survival however when the bandits attack the old miller and his family in the grist mill kikuchoiyo comes to the rescue and saves a baby boy from the dying arms of its mother kikuchoiyo breaks down in holding the child in a stream with warfare surrounding him and wails that this exact thing happened to him as a child in the jungian sense kikuchoiyo reclaimed his orphan child self at this point he saves a real child but he also saves an inner psychic child within himself and thus this allows him to be a true samurai rather than an imposter samurai he is a fighting force full of emotion and power he taps into the natural biological forces of injustice in the final battle scenes ironically this is what brings about his end for those who fight with pure emotion exceed their bounds when the rifleman bandit kills kyuzo from behind a wooden screen kikuchoiyo is overtaken with rage and attacks the screen trying to pull it apart to reach the bandit he takes a bullet in the belly but goes on fighting until he collapses this brings us to the final penacle of heroism kambei the mastermind samurai leader with a vast range of intellectual interpersonal and warrior skills kambei has a range of leadership skills including ability to make realistic assessments so as not to support unrealistic optimism ability to use small resources to bring down much larger forces ability to fight on the edges the fringes to deplete the resources and power of his enemy ability to mentor other men by drawing out their unique talent and using that talent for the greater good ability to judge the greater good from immediate gains ability to change course in the middle of battle when the facts reveal that a new strategy is needed abiltiy to recover quickly from loss and mve forward and an ability to use humor and a personal relationship to move men toward action finally he has incredible humility which allows him to make realistic assessments of conditions and resources and dynamics humility is an underestimated asset humility is essential to the leader because egotism and grandiosity cloud a man 's vision humility keeps vision clear an essential for survival and leadership now we come to the second theme of the film which is understanding the actions of all the characters witin a context of classism and a stratified society the meek clownlike foolish farmers gradually are seen as far from timid fools they survive amidst overwhelming odds they hire ronin which were the masterless unemployeed samurai soldiers that roamed japan in the century in the end four of the seven samurai are burried with distinction in the village cemetary but as kambei points out it is the farmers that won the battle they overcame a threat to their existence the samurai being a tool by which they overcame the threat when the village women kill a single bandit in a chicken house using garden hoes we see evidence of the willingness of these farmers to fight for survival however the farmers like the samurai owe much to the realistic strategic leadership of kambei within this epic masterpiece are two subplots of great interest first young farmer rikichi always seems to be hiding something and as the story progresses we learn that his young wife was stolen by the bandits and is now their sex slave rikichi volunteers to attack their camp and we learn it is to find his wife however as he peeps into the bandit lair he sees her despondent and in deep grief when she sees flames at both ends of the shack her first instict is to scream but her second is to remain silent in hopes that she and the bandits will all burn to death she eventually runs from the shack but when she sees rikichi her overwhelming shame forces her to run back into the burning building where she is lost the second subplot was the seduction of the young warrior katshushiro by shino the daughter of farmer manzo i have never seen such masterful body language as is demonstrated by shino as she seduces the young man while maintaining the pretend role of the persued this is a fantastic work of art that almost defies description due to its depth and mastery of storytelling it is a film where many forces of art converge to produce a rare masterpiece
seven samurai is the greatest film made by perhaps the world 's greatest film director the string of films from rashomon to red beard represents an almost unbroken run of classic films all but one starring toshiro mifune not the least for the fact that akira kurosawa was able to infuse humanism and populism amongst the chaos and indifference in a wide variety of settings individuals could make a difference in an indifferent society ikiru red beard or work together for a common cause seven sanjuro while in other films the inhumanity of class culture the lower depths stray dog high and low was laid bare yet at other times it could be seen that kurosawa soured on the idea that society could change for the better in films like the bad sleep well and record of a living being giving way to the chaos of fortress of blood and yojimbo but whether pessimistic or optimistic kurosawa 's films seldom fail to both entertain and inform seven samurai 's principle strength is that it manages to do both on an extraordinarily high level for a film of this length three hours and 27 minutes there is almost no wasted footage nothing here is simply there to be pretty and a slow patch everything has a purpose there is nothing mysterious about the motivations of the bandits the conflicting attitudes of the villagers the quiet charisma of kambei takashi shimura which binds the samurai to a cause for which there is little to be gained besides a meal and possibly death from the beginning there is a logical progression of human action in relation to the problem at had the viewer has the feeling that the film has a completeness that other epic films strive for but fail to achieve although at times it may seem otherwise to a viewer weaned on violence or cheap emotion seven is never a dull polemic humor abounds and conflicts between villagers the samurai are often accentuated to elicit maximum but never melodramatic emotional effect even during periods of quiet contemplation kurosawa wo n't let the incongruities of human existence escape unnocticed kyuzo sits under a tree reflecting on a flower he has picked and an instant later he rises to kill two bandits just as serenely when they come the battle sequences are given over to realism not style watching the attack on the bandits ' hideout we are amazed that unlike the stylized in current films we see men who do n't have time to pose simply hacking away before they get hacked in the final battle sequence kurosawa turns up the authenticity to a fever pitch we become so involved in the fighting ourselves that by the time the innocent katsushiro is overcome with bloodlust we too are disappointed that all the bad guys are already dead unlike the original criterion release the film is split on two discs rather than one apparently to accommodate a slightly improved video transfer and two additional audio tracks one a new 5.1 dolby surround sound the other a new commentary track michael jeck 's audio commentary is a holdover from the first release and for me it is preferable since like the film it is lean and to the point and does n't drown out the film track so that one can enjoy the film with the benefit of jeck explaining cultural idiosyncrasies and film technique the new commentary track is split between a film critics one taking over a particular section of the film from the other this gimmick is at times disconcerting and while it may be of some interest to hear a variety of opinions the fact that they do n't compete with one another means we do n't learn anything much that is new as one might expect from a set there are a few supplements whether they are worth the 49.99 price tag may be a matter of conjecture the most interesting to me of these is my life in cinema '' in which kurosawa discusses the evolution of his art at the outset the interviewer tells him that his tall stature is not typical '' of the japanese as the discussion goes on apparently neither does the conformist japanese stereotype apply to him despite his reputation on the set here we see an often bemused modest and individual foreigners treat us japanese filmmakers like vips in japan we 're treated like tramps '' he jokes at one point two additional documentaries are the serviceable overview of the film from the it is wonderful to create '' series and of the samurai film genre seven samurai origins and influences '' there is also a small booklet which contains a few brief comments from a variety of individuals the one of greater interest is provided by mifune who like some other great actors of our time did n't take himself or his profession too seriously we certainly get the sense that mifune was proud to be a part of seven samurai but as for having fun doing it that was another matter if a film ever deserved special edition treatment it is seven samurai i would have preferred a more thorough and penetrating documentary for a film of this caliber and i suspect the price may scare away all but the most devoted film aficionados still if you have to have it you have to have it
i just loved this set well worth the money spent this is something that the whole family can enjoy tyler perry and his cast are superb i look forward to seeing what tyler comes out with next
my family and i have been fans of tyler perry since seeing our first madea video borrowed from a friend several years ago when i saw this set i had to have it he speaks the language of families and has much better subject matter and language in his productions than many my family could see elsewhere we are making plans to see his latest production what 's done in the dark '' live and know it will be worth it get this set for your dvd library you wo n't regret it
excellent plays by tyler perry they were both funny and inspirational i have watched all the plays over and over again
i will admit to this i love madea got her book dvd 's trying to get the latest ones i am a big fan i go to the movies on opening weekend what i like about these plays and movies is that they have a message a message that has been sort of lost and that is you do n't have to have sex to be with someone you should remember god in what you do ok madea is over the top '' sometimes but how are you going to defute that she is n't getting the message across to the millions of black fans that flock to her plays and shows made the book a bestseller and is basically making tyler perry a household name is she that bad a character that we have to ignore her i do n't think so i can say this and that is we all have a madea in our lives and if you do n't mind me writing this we sure need more ! ! now three years ago i did n't know nothing about tyler perry watched his diary of a mad black woman '' play and though that is n't my particular favorite i was hooked watched his family reunion and got even more hooked went to the movies when they came out and i 'm sorry you just can not tell me she is all bad she is more needed than these plays come highly recommended peace
i 'll admit that i 'm a to the madea '' series finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his the opinionated never lit by the way madea '' have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans mostly nationwide though the stories feature the characters the belligerent teenager the devoted wife the straying husband the vixens the lotharios etc and situations infidelity promiscuity straying from the church comedic funerals obnoxious and overbearing family members perry 's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story 's ending dependent upon divine intervention making things right some of the acting performances are a little over the top and the musical selections though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists are weak in the lyrics department however as a whole the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by hollywood and is having great success on both the stage and screen this compilation lets the viewer experience revisit those stage shows
i loved the movie diary of a mad black woman '' ! i loved the fact that he showed that you can have love and integrity in a relationship by not having sex before marriage all the plays that i have seen have left me laughing and crying keep up the good work tyler
i own the tyler perry collection and all i can say is that i would tell everyone to get his movies and plays i am also looking foward to see more of his work check it out you wo n't be sorry
as the widow of an african american teen i have always tried to find positive male role models for my son in literature art movies etc in addition to friends and family that would help foster his growth into adulthood not an easy task given that i am not only his mother but white too my son and i just happened to go see madea 's family reunion in the theater this past weekend he was so profoundly affected by this movie that we rented another tyler perry movie the same weekend my son age 18 said that the positive male role models in these films and their committment to exposing the truth there are real men out there who love and respect women these men do n't seek to conquer or control a woman but be a part of healing and restoration '' was something that other film producers should be doing
tyler perry is really a blessing in disguise i went to my moms for a visit and learned that he had the plays out all of the plays are hilliarious and have a great message behind them all of my films worked just fine
the bad news is the premise is ludicrous the government opperatives are idiots and if the cia really hires bad guys like these we 're doomed the good news is i have every bad habit known to movie lovers and can still enjoy the fast pace likeable characters and overall entertainment value of this yarn sure cub scout investigators do n't trip over the biggest murder conspiracy since hoffa but hey ! it 's julia roberts at her sickly sweet best perversion has it 's rewards
i ordered the pelican brief for a friend i ca n't stand julia roberts i love the andrea bocelli cd i ordered i received it promptly and there is n't a thing wrong with it i enjoy being able to order used items through your site
the pelican brief is a great story filled with drama and action when something bad happens or someone gets killed you can see the sadness on the face of julia roberts she is a great actor she acts her part in a very very amazing way ! she can continue on being sad and serious at the same time ! you got to watch this movie ! !
this is arguably hayworth 's musical and it has such great dancing in it ! ! let 's start with that title number 'cover girl ' after the male chorus sings and we are presented with about a dozen of the leading models of the day the camera opens on rita wrapped in gold with clouds floating about her she peels off her wrap and slowly floats down what turns out to be a huge winding ramp the size of a mountain slowly gathering momentum as the music begins to boom eventually running down at full speed to join the male chorus at the bottom there she effortlessly does spins backdrops and lifts her red hair flying about her her beautiful body shown off in a flowing strapless gold gown a vision of sparkling red and gold they really do n't make movies like this anymore ! ! this is one of the best and most popular musicals of the forties columbia pictures spared no expense on this film and it shows cover girl is a rich and elaborate film the next most memorable number for me is 'long ago and far away ' a beautiful emotional duet between hayworth and kelly and one of the best remembered songs of the 1940 's there is genuine chemistry between the two you can see kelly 's eyes pop at hayworth as they sing the last verses together and as the music takes them over there 's a long sensuous hug and a number of steps between the two that leads to hayworth swooning deeply into kelly 's arms rapturous hayworth and kelly also have a duet to 'put me to the test ' the two both dressed in varying shades of green ! tap jump and spin all over the stage in a fast paced complicated routine choreographed by kelly then there 's the 'make way for tomorrow ' tap dance with hayworth kelly and phil silvers a joyous tap dance in the streets kelly would later use this theme many times in his career and the celebrated 'alter ego ' solo for kelly i could go on and on the music by jerome kern and ira gershwin is wonderful the scoring of this film won the oscar that year 1944 there 's also flashbacks to the 1890 's with hayworth playing her grandmother really a mini gay 90 's musical is in this film we have 2 films in one ! ! the rich technicolor is stunning the designs and colors of the costumes are incredible kelly silvers eve arden otto kruger all wonderful but the film belongs to the beautiful and talented rita hayworth who truly was a goddess in the flesh ! !
rita heyworth gene kelly phil silvers and eve arden stars in in this lavishly produced musical about a nighclub dancer from brooklyn who leaves her sweatheart after winning a cover girl contest to learn that fame and fortune are no substitute for true love cover girl proved to be a turning point in the history of the hollywood musical for the first time the songs were not merely strung together but were themself vital elements serving to move the story forward cover girl was also a major turning point in the career of gene kelly as it established him as virtouso choreographer as well as a major dancing talent the techically revolutionary after ego '' dance in which kelly dances with himself provided the inspiration of his later singing in the rain 1952 numer and was according to kelly the most difficult film sequence she ever done cover girl also cemented hayworths reputation as hollywood most talented female dancer betty grable herself admitted that heyworth dances rings around here cover girl also boast a sparkling score by jerome kern and ira gerschwin with the enduring ballad long ago and far away '' which won an academy award nomination for best song 1944 long ago and far away '' remains one of the most beautiful songs ever written for a film cover girl also received four other nomonation for best score best sound best color art direction and best set decoration transfer in quality do you neded a better recommendation ! buy it and enjoy hollywood magic fron the past
yes i too think very highly of this movie thematically it 's truly a zero and yet with all the great singing dancing comedy and technicolor who really cares a previous reviewer said that he or she could not find shelley winters i am reasonably certain she is the office girl in the who 's complaining '' number
my wife wanted this movie and i was surprised to find it on dvd was i glad ! if you 've forgotten about how good movie musicals can be give this one a try with rita hayworth gene kelly and phil silvers at the top of their form and with words and music by the gershwins this is about as good as it gets of the great female dancers in movie musicals there is rita hayworth cyd charisse leslie caron and a few others trained as a dancer since childhood hayworth always was right up at the top of the list this movie shows why and of course she 's gorgeous and a darn good comic actor gene kelly 's dance with his in this movie may not be as famous as his singin ' in the rain number but it should be ! try it you 'll like it
this columbia musical may be something of an artifact now but it was designed to showcase rita hayworth it does it so professionally that the movie is still a lot of fun to watch the story is almost irrelevant to the movie rusty parker hayworth is a talented dancer working at a struggling dinner theater danny mcguire 's place in brooklyn danny gene kelly and rusty love each other and danny is determined that one of these days his talents as a choreographer dancer and showman will lead to the big time with rusty but rusty gets noticed by john coudair otto kruger a wealthy high society publisher and he makes rusty the cover girl of one of his most popular magazines vanity and the rest is history rusty becomes the hit of new york a theater producer wants her for a show and wants to marry her and danny seeing this happen reluctantly decides he ca n't stand in her way there 's another story going on too forty years ago coudair had fallen hard for a showgirl maribelle hicks despite coudair 's riches and position maribelle left him at the last minute to marry the poor piano player she really loved rusty does n't know this story and it turns out she was maribelle 's grand daughter what will rusty do well watch the movie if you 're in any doubt the movie however is worth watching for several other reasons first is the performance by rita hayworth in fact just the presence of hayworth she really was a beautiful creature with those long legs red hair and a perfectly natural and friendly personality she also was a dancer betty grable once said hayworth could dance rings around her many critics agree that hayworth was the best dance partner astaire ever had even when doing a fast tap routine hayworth could carry it off with great grace and look completely relaxed as if she were having great fun check her out for instance in the shorty george tap routine with astaire from you were never lovelier she gives that same feeling of joy in dancing while working with kelly second are the songs by jerome kern and ira gershwin long ago and far away was the big hit but the entire score is one classy song after another including make way for tomorrow cover girl sure thing and the show must go on long ago in fact was the biggest money earner for gershwin bringing in considerably more than any of the songs he wrote with his brother he said several times that he did n't think the lyric was as good as it could have been one of the songs put me to the test has a lyric that gershwin originally wrote for a song with his brother it never went anywhere so when he had some trouble with the idea he mentioned to kern that he had a lyric that had already been set to music by george he said he did n't know whether kern would be offended but kern just laughed and asked to see the words third are some nice performances by the supporting players phil silvers as the best friend of both rusty and danny plays comic relief and matchmaker he does a nice job of it otto kruger as usual plays a smoothie but he has a few subtle double takes he handles skillfully he also of course does the right thing by rusty he manages to show regret and affection and it is always fun to see eve arden once again as the sardonic side kick this time to coudair she was so type cast in granite that i always wonder how well she could have managed in a few really serious roles i do n't recall ever seeing her in one fourth is the glossy professional technicolor sheen of the movie everything the sets the costumes the lighting the makeup is handled with the kind of hollywood studio perfection that is n't seen anymore even when the showgirls are putting on their makeup they 're perfectly made up kelly does a good job especially with the alter ego dance he does with himself and which is often highlighted in specials about his career but cover girl remains very much rita hayworth 's movie the dvd transfer is excellent technicolor never looked better there are no extras
if you can get past the zany and tiresome antics of phil silvers and the corny cliched script there 's a wonderful technicolor musical here called cover girl '' gorgeous rita hayworth is rusty parker a nite club chorine who becomes the toast of broadway overnite when she 's chosen to be the cover girl of vanity magazine to the chagrin of the club 's owner danny mcguire gene kelly who 's her boyfriend and her catty hayworth is absolutely beautiful and dances with the most natural grace and elegance ever captured on screen as far as i 'm concerned gene kelly 's acting is stiff but his dancing is what you 're watching here as well boy could he dance ! he has a great solo number on an empty street where he dances with his reflection from an empty store window absolute artistry in motion eve arden as a talent scout brings much needed relief to the tired script with her delivery of brittle comebacks and one liners she 's also outfitted in the most outre ' chic costumes and hats hollywood ever laid out all the costumes by the great travis banton are something to behold but it 's the technicolor that brings things to life and hayworth who brings the technicolor to life in her broadway debut she comes running down a seemingly endless elevated platform in a flowing gold gown like a goddess descending from the heavens long red hair cascading behind her then after a dance number with chorus guys she runs back up the platform through a downpour of shimmering sparkles and into a cloud of pink smoke sheer technicolor movie magic cover girl '' is n't the best musical ever made but as a showcase for one of the most beautiful actresses ever photographed in technicolor and a very nice song called long ago and far away '' it gets 5 stars from me when you watch this you can see there was only one rita hayworth and her grace talent and beauty are captured in splendor on this dvd print
a superlatively fascinating and film i watched enthrallingly such an awesomely produced film acting scenes affects but above all the truth of the truth and the lie '' the truth is the truth even if no one believes it and a lie is a lie even if everyone believes it '' this film clearly shows the extreme and abysmal difference between good and evil or truth and lies it clearly shows that truth has already overcome evil it has been vanquished it is up to each and every one of us to work out our salvation in fear and trembling this movie helps one come to terms with the seriousness of one 's eternal salvation and the dangers which can lie in wait for us if we allow ourselves to be caught up in lies we must pray for truth and discernment so as not to succumb to temptation that endangers our eternal soul
i am a female over 50 and i love to watch all 3 movies there is so much bravery and i love the fight scenes there is no nudity or foul language the movie just is an inspiration for good to conquer all i really do n't know how peter jackson pulled these 3 great movies off they are truly a masterpiece i especially like the elves at helms deep
yes i know i said this was better than the first three star wars movies star wars was a great trilogy but being a tolkien fan these movies were done amazingly i had an idea of in my mind after reading the books but peter jackson makes you believe so vividly in the world that he has created i loved every minute of each movie that is the only movie i can say that about the acting and cg are amazing the casting choices were phenomanal and peter jackson showed us that he is the next spielberg after king kong the funny thing is that the story of how peter jackson got this to the big screen is a lot like how george lucas got star wars to the theatres too at first peter jackson was going to make one movie of the three books because no studio wanted to risk that much money on a dream project new line cinema was one of the last studios he went too and they thankfully told him that there were three books so there should be three movies anyway these movies are amazing and thats all you need to know
i loved these movies and watched the extended versions but preferred to purchase these ones because i didnt read the books so its just the movies for me i think the extended version and extras are for book fans its a little weird that the fellowship of the rings doesnt have spanish subtitles but the other two did i dont know why but good collection great story good performances amazing music incredible scenes
i find it rather amusing how so many kids writing these reviews bash the trilogy mostly because they have no patience and lack the ability to respect a story for someone who has n't read the books i absolutely loved this trilogy the fact that so many people considered the acting in these movies horrible surprises i thought the acting was the best i 've seen in any movie in a long time the beautiful landscapes portrayed in the films are another thing i enjoyed all of the creatures in the films mostly the orcs looked almost hauntingly real orlando bloom did a fantastic job in learning archery for this the battles shown in these movies are a thousand times better than the weak one shown in the newer movie the chronicles of narnia '' as for people saying to watch the shrek series instead of this i do n't even understand why you 're comparing an animated comedy to a long epic in the first place i admit i felt that the end of return of the king '' seemed to drag on but the movie itself is still worth watching the power of friendship is really shown in this last movie as well as the power of the ring i think elijah wood was a bit weak in some parts of this movie but how great he was in fellowship of the ring '' definately makes up for it basically this trilogy is great for anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre in general if you 're all about the newage action movies and comedies do n't bother there may be several witty comments shared between legolas and gimli but that does n't make any of the movies a comedy if you 've read the books get the extended versions of the movies if you think they 're long enough already then you 'd probably get bored so i would n't recommend it
first you have to love the cover art '' review great summary of the music dude i expect this guy has no idea who the twilight singers are much less greg dulli or his tradition of performing covers likewise i 'm sure this went straight over tomer cooper 's '' head second this is a great dvd any singer should n't hesitate to buy it present are the characteristic dulli charisma and rockin ' good tunes you 'd expect but captured live each song takes on new life it 's just a damned good show put on by damned fine musicians i love watching these guys work the audio quality is n't great but it suffices it 's live if you 've heard live performances before you know the deal not great but not bad and two minutes in you 'll forget it altogether buy it you wo n't regret it
this video is just what the title implies a live bootlegged performance there 's no deceitful post production trickery happening here no studio overdubs or cut and paste song arrangement this is a fan produced video you see and hear it just as it happenned the sound is recorded from the camera mics and the stage is dimly lit do n't expect gorgeously mixed soundstage like audio and video and for those very reasons not in spite of this is a wonderful acquisition the band is on top of their game dulli is in typical macho overdrive and the setlist is plump and complete coming in at just under two hours not to mention marcy mays popping in for a of the afghan whigs classic my curse with former whigs members for a faux reunion simply a great documentation of a great night of rock n roll
this movie was excellent and very funny at times i promise everyone that they would not be disappointed in the purchase of this movi
i really liked this film it 's a bit long for most people but most of eastwood 's films generally run a bit on the long side i loved the languourous pacing of the whole thing the film takes its time showing us savannah its people its character and its dark side kevin spacey gives a performance that should have won an oscar john cusack is excellent as well but the most surprising performance here goes to jack thompson as spacey 's lawyer thompson is actually an australian actor who was in breaker morant years ago yet he does the southern style so well you 'd think he was raised in savannah the most intriguing performance if you can call it that goes to the lady chablis an actual transvestite performer who resides in savannah the scene where she goes to the cotillion is one of the best scenes in the entire film she has grace dignity and mystique and clint lets the camera linger on her along with the lady chablis spacey 's character is homosexual in thompson 's final argument during the murder trial he talks about his client 's homosexuality but says if god thinks it 's a sin then god should judge it the generally positive portrayals of spacey 's character and chablis show that a film can contain a message yet be subtle about it and not hammer you over the head with it most hollywood films that have gay characters in them always have that tolerance '' speech in them as if the viewer is an idiot well some viewers are and has to have everything spoon fed to her or him eastwood reportedly got some flack from right wing commentators over this film primarily for his portrayal of the homosexual characters eastwood has identified himself generally as a republican but he seems more of a libertarian than anything else eastwood 's films have always had digs at people who try and dictate your conduct bridges of madison county has a powerful scene in a diner commenting on this and this film is consistent with that point of view some have argued that this film is a horrible adaptation of the book i have n't read it but the film itself is very well done
my husband and i had seen the movie several times before i ordered it from amazon we never get tired of it even tho the movie is of a different sort ! it has love murder and lots of things to keep you interested it is n't a movie just for the girls but i would keep it to adults or older teens
usually when you love a book you hate the movie especially if the book is a great piece of literature but in this case i ca n't decide which i liked better the casting for this movie was just perfect ! i especially loved that the lady chablis played the lady chablis in the movie john cusak 's transgender friend john cusak was great as the author of the story john berendt and kevin spacey was just as great as the antiques dealer on trial for murder the scenery and homes of savanah were integral to the book and they came across beautifully in the movie it was just wonderfully done it is a very funny movie that is also very deep and beautiful you really have to watch this movie you also really must read the book they are both way too good to miss !
inliked the film in the theater and i like the film now the plot does not drag and does not bore
this has got to be one of the best concerts in history we had it on vhs but the dvd is incredible
i 'm not a pink floyd fan i bought this as a gift for someone else he talked me into watching it and i must say i am impressed this is as good a concert as i have ever seen
every song on here is incredible ! ! comfortably numb 's solo is insane and it has the ball drop down and shining light ! ! ! omg ! ! ! insane ! ! get it ! ! ! !
well this is one of the dvds from pink floyd the video and sound are great the extras are not so special but for the pf fan this is a must still waiting for the delicate sound of thunder '' dvd
this dvd is a must have for all pink floyd fans and music fans not only does this dvd bring back to light the incredible energy and creativeness of the one and only pink floyd light show but the sound and reproduction of the music is fantastic watching this dvd makes me glad to know i saw pink floyd once live but it also will make you yearn for just one more shot at seeing this music live who needs roger waters anyway
this dvd set is awesome and well worth the money it was promptly delivered in a couple of days i was actually shocked it arrived so quickly ! if you are a pink floyd fan you will definitely enjoy this concert box set the lighting designers on this show really know how to use the 's to their full potential definitely check it out
omg this dvd is fantastic ! disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is lots of extras some better than others the time spent everything was time well spent the effort that went into this tour is mind boggling a lot of times i just put it on and play it as background music it even works as a 'pink floyd greatest hits ' soundtrack sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends les claypool dvd but everyone i have played this dvd for wants their own copy if you are a pink floyd fan get it ! you will not be disappointed
this is the best of pink floyd i just keep watching it over and over great dvd
pulse is a terrific arrangement of classic pink floyd including pre and post roger waters songs old and new fans alike ca n't help but be enthralled with the selections and the unbelievable laser and light show it will blow you away especially enjoyable are the extra features in particular the bootleging the bootlegers was a nice touch all in all this dvd was worth every penny
when i first saw this movie i really did n't know what to think its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for enjoyment '' that being said i love this movie and here 's why 1. it 's a true story 2. it is extremely patriotic even if it 's patriotism displayed by the wrong '' country how can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country this was in my opinion and i feel the only flaw was harrison ford playing a russian if you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing but i appreciate this film very much for the values it displays
it 's 1961 the ussr has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the east coast of the united states for the purpose of brinksmanship but hold on there is a problem the soviet union is staffed with incompetents ! ! one of communism 's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel the menacing black submarine is doomed from the it leaks and it is cobbled together with substandard parts after heading out to sea there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits the men receive lethal doses of radiation but unfortunately the doctor does n't know anything about radiation sickness he is only giving them aspirin before long radiation begins to permeate the ship the entire crew is in danger the officers are of two minds some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the americans while others want to save face for the soviet union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die as the submarine becomes more and more disabled as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby american destroyer as the submarines 's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat the dread of the crew is really palpable this movie was very suspenseful because i had no idea how it would end definitely worth your time
in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event ! it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the harrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains and as believable as their rebuilt authentic ! kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd bottom line this new kind of sub film is a part of history if you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best if you enjoy thrillers this film delivers enough tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the and in anyone
for those who do n't know russian the title of this was review of thought i 'd be funny there this movie is not so much a combat movie it 's a what happened movie the flagship of the russian navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 captians yea that kinda do n't go over so well they have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys it is quite a gripping movie though this is also one that needs to be bought not just rented
this was a true story and a scary part of our history the book comes to life in the movie i pictured another person as the captain of the sub ford did a good job acting the part
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october '' or crimson tide '' whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian
there are so much information about this movie in description and other reviews so i do n't want to repeat them the only problem in this movie was harisson ford 's style he was acting more american than russian and for moments you may feel that is an american submarine and harisson ford is an american captain he was trying to act like an staborn phenomenon but despite of all of his efforts he could n't deny his american friquent style ! i think harrison ford for this movie was not a wise decision i know starring first class actor like him could guarantee the best selling of this movie and no one can blame the studio for trying to make more money but me myself really dissapointed of such flaw in this astonishing movie
the widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961 when a soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown harrison ford and liam neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense ford portrays the overly harsh commander and neeson the captain in touch with the men probably the best submarine movie there is especially when compared to the ridiculous crimson tide '' and '' the cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown
when i first viewed jurassic park '' in a theatre on wilshire blvd in los angeles i actually walked out it was n't so much because of the film but the speaker system in the theatre were so darn loud i thought i was back on an air force flightline i actually had to cover my ears it was so irritating and i was not alone many others got up to leave too this film has been discussed to the point that i do n't believe there is anything further i can add however i am not a big dinosaur film type person i really like archaelogy and paleantology however as one who is not a specialist but through an interest in the past however when i viewed the film again on dvd i found the film pretty darn interesting and a very fun watch it was exciting and the dinosaurs were done very well and more importantly what i liked about the film is how the scientific community at lest one rich man in particular who is funding them shows their disrespect and arrogance for nature and the natural selection by interfering with what is best left alone this was delved into in a very enlightening and interesting way in the film i highly recommend the film if you have young or teenagers as i do they will enjoy the film it is action packed and a very suspenseful film especially the dinosaur scenes recommended
jurassic park is one of the best if not the best movies made about dinosaurs ever it 's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released it 's also one of the first movies to use cgi in significant scenes throughout the film it 's also the movie that gave sam neill a break and reinvigorated the career of jeff goldblum the movie promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier got the general public and not just kids excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what raiders of the lost ark did to archaeology the premise seeped in pop science is that a john hammond richard attenborough brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber he builds a zoological he calls jurassic park however in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park 's workers hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable thus alan grant sam neill ellie sattler laura dern and ian malcolm jeff goldblum arrive to tour the facilities hammond 's grandchildren lex ariana richards and tim murphy joseph mazzello are also along for the ride as test subjects due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose jurassic park set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it is n't difficult to see why the cgi effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then yet the creatures appear completely lifelike of course spielberg not only used cgi but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well it was a massive undertaking but one that had a huge payoff there 's not much to complain about with jurassic park sam neill is great as grant the role was originally offered to harrison ford and i 'm actually glad he turned it down and jeff goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen after 15 years of directing his own movies richard attenborough came back for the perfect part as john hammond the action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres the movie is classic spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made this dvd includes a very informative documentary about the making of jurassic park some clips from an early production meeting it 's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real spielberg some storyboards and other illustrations phil tippett 's animatic of the raptors in the kitchen '' sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having tongues trailers for all three jurassic park movies a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie some production notes and a list and partial filmography of the cast crew
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way '' in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random '' unpredictable events result from the normal '' because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive '' in a environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict behavior of his animals love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated though i found hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex i prefer to be called a hacker '' uses silicon graphics ' file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice
this movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great the action scenes are particularly terrifying particularly when the breaks through the fence also when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen too bad i was rooting for the raptors but still these scenes in particular were very very real very scary and ! it 's equally interesting to judge what did n't work in this movie the characters not quite as weak as those in the book but close many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake and of course the bulk of the book 's great science got lost but still none of this really matters that much the scary scenes were awfully scary ! those dinosaurs looked real ! i can watch those scenes over and over and over again so owning a quality dvd like this makes it easy ! if you do n't have it already give it a shot !
'jurassic park ' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'best picture ' nod at the oscars now some of you may not agree and then some of you may i feel that 'jurassic park ' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen adapted loosly from michael crichton 's novel of the same name 'jurassic park ' delivers a solid script solid acting and solid thrills that can not and will not be repeated as is proven by the failed attempts in 'the lost world ' and 'jurassic park iii ' both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original before the doors to the amusement park to end all amusement parks is opened the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look amoung these experts is a mathematician goldbloom and dern and neill of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit or i should say a lot skeptical but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned the film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive one of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise this is the film to beat
this movie is the bomb ! i had such a great time with this movie ! jurassic park has always been great ! the videogames where great ! and i loved the soundtrack ! if you have seeen my other reviews you will know i love a movie with a great soundtrack and this one got it ! hey who dosent like dino action over to your left there are man eating dinos they are gon na shread you ! so much action ! this movie couldent get any better ! well if they somehow got lost in the city it would be the bomb ! but hey this movie is great ! i had a great time and you will too
i 'm trying to decide which of the three i love the best but all should be part of one 's home library i often view them while i 'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster ! it 's easy to forget you 're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the jurassic park movie collection chrissy mcvay autho
plot a mafia lawyer commits suicide but before he does he forces old mark sway who lives with his brother and mother in a trailer park into the car and so he tells mark secrets about where loisianna senator boyd boyette was buried since mark 's little brother has a stress syndrome he ca n't see anything scary randy sway had to go to the hospital ever since his father was divorced he tends to believe that lawyers are morons at times they can get in the way and gets his info about courts and judges on mark meets reggie love a woman lawyer who used to have a drinking problem at first he does n't trust her after many pelts by mafia and annoying reporters already sick of elvis sightings mark has to trust her positives mark is told by reggie that he ca n't lie or he 'll be just like them mafia as such the mafia in this movie are seen as a bunch of criminals even though mark was threatened by a very nasty mafia dude '' he tries to tell the truth he did n't tell about where boyd was buried many scriptures from the bible are written in cells and there is a picture of jesus in the hospital though mark can be a pest at times reggie tries to help him because she cares about him negatives for those people who do n't like cursing there is a moderate amount of cussing in the film of them comes from mark sway 's mouth which disturbed me a bit mark also gives a mafia guy the middle finger secretly mark disobeys his mother by going in the woods and therefore getting mixed up with all this mark got his info about an affair like this on and he claims that he saw a guy having his legs blown off because of the witness protection program on though this is n't shown due to medication mark 's mother fights the at one point though you have to watch to find out funnies in the hospital elvis '' complains about his guitar the way reggie deals with mark at times can be humorous conclusion if you can take the negatives then i highly recommend this movie though i 'd like to say that you should n't buy the client '' to anybody younger than thirteen because even though violence is rarely seen
a mixture of characters seemingly inescapable situations mystery thrilling action and truly scary moments make this film a solid piece of work the seasoned and talented cast add the spice that makes this a tasty thriller for any fan of the cinema emotion spills effortlessly into every corner of the film spreading 'human ' moments everywhere there 's never a dull moment
the is an excellent movie packed full of fine actors and a plot that grabs you immediately and does n't let go the young boy who stars with susan sarandon is an excellent actor and plays such a strong and admirable character of not only a boy his age but of any age a movie i will want to watch again
i enjoyed this movie because it had both suspense and entertainment in it and an excellent cast i highly recommend it
it 's been years since i 'd seen the client but i found the performances of susan sarandon and tommy lee jones as adept and entertaining as ever bradley whitford was playing josh lyman long before west wing and it was fun to see him in this film and funny to think he 's been playing with or near mary louise parker for years ! they seem so young and ageless this is a great film to watch when it 's grey and cold outside because it 's always warm and pretty in memphis in this film
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love '' risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength courage wit and willingness to go up against the big tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools
i saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd i do have to say the movie was renfro plays mark a rebelling boy who knows something that he do n't have to know susan sarandon plays a lawyer who helps mark she did it great tommy lee johnes plays a lawyer who want to ask mark what he saw you must watch
brilliant surandon is captivating tommy lee jones is ruthless in his role the movie has some funny scenes touching and sad scenes and is just an all out powerful movie this is one powerful drama movie with a bit of humor at times it 's really sad what happens at the beginning but the ending is great i love the cast the director adapting the movie from book is great not an easy book to do an adaptation to the young boy who plays mark is very stylish in his role you can figure out what i mean by that if you want i saw this in grade in my american legal systems class and got hooked on it yesterday bought it on dvd and will watch this one over and over again it 's really a classic drama
cesar 's approach of using calm assertiveness is gentle and effective if you are using pain or fear to force your dog to behave how you want then you are doing it wrong he uses no tension on the leash unless doing a quick touch or leash movement to redirect the dog 's focus not at all to bring pain he meets the dogs on their level and helps to 'train ' humans on dog psychology correcting the idea that all dogs are little humans they are n't and approaching them using dog psychology works gently and effectively our dog is a lucky recipient of this training method and he is not only happier but healthier from the new routine cesar has outlined for us in this video and in his show on national geographic channel the dog whisperer
i heard about burn the floor when it came to our city as a musical at the denver center for performing arts i could not afford the tickets but heard such great reviews about the performances i love dancing and ballroom dancing especially i can not dance as well as i use to when i was 30 years younger but when i watch burn the floor i get transported back in time when i was able to move like that and i get up and move ! this movie is a great movie to review the moves you use to do when you were younger and you can follow the steps the dancers provide to reteach yourself them again what a good teaching tool especially the last cut of the musical i play over and over again try to get up off the couch and dance great move
it was so much better than anything i could imagine absolutely loved the dancing and the costumes wish i could 've been there
the beginning of the routine is rather slow i 'm not really into modern dance but the costumes the way the dancers flow together the music the dancing make this an outstanding film i would recommend this very highly to anyone who likes videos
if you like taped choreography or theater dance stuff you will like this but it is not a dance movie
prepared to be disappointed my husband and i were awed by the dancing in this unusual and unique stage performance and too wired to sleep we were not at all disappointed though burn the floor '' is a fusion of ballroom dancing with fred ginger martha graham bob fosse buzby berkely riverdance ballet and jazz the resulting amalgam is something entirely new and i can not recall seeing so many fabulous dancers in one place at one time the costuming was sensational especially for the continental '' number it would be hard to get more elegant the music was pounding but not overly so the sound rendition was excellent and the editor nick morris should get a special award for excellence while he could have utilized far fewer cuts which tend to throw the music track off rhythm just a fraction enough for purists to be annoyed he was mercifully judicious about his camera cuts they were not overdone as in the michael flatley dvd 's in future dvd 's of new burn the floor '' shows should there be any i hope morris is used again is an artist in his own right except for a slight overzealousness about using as to the content with the exception of the second number a number that struck a discordant note among an otherwise stellar program the rest of the numbers were mesmerizing the variety of themes and choreography are superbly innovative especially the use of props and both create a pleasant tension by being unpredictable you never know what 's coming next just as john curry raised ice dancing to a new level and made it a new creature known as ice ballet burn the floor '' has also taken ballroom dancing tweaked and enhanced it made it tell a story and made it a new creature do n't expect straight ballroom dancing in this program it 's more much more but the ballroom influence is having said that the strong sexual nature of bits and pieces of the program plus some of the costuming make it unfit for family viewing unless you do n't care that young children see butts and a good deal of cleavage the in the otherwise wildly exciting finale could and should have been left on the cutting room floor and for certain should not have been a deliberate part of the otherwise fantastic family viewing all things considered this is a spectacular dance dvd and will wipe the floor let alone burn it with all the others
really nice dancing with some innovative moves and choreography the dancers are definetely top notch just like their credentials would suggest if do not want to watch another booooring and hokey ballroom show this is the dvd for you it ranks up there with shall we dance '' japanese version as a great dance dvd the last samba number is amazing if there is one thing i would change with the show it is that it does not have enough latin dancing i kept waiting in vain for another chacha and a good salsa or rueda and nothing happened burn the floor '' guys are you listening !
there is nothing i enjoy better than watching beautiful people strunt their graceful moves and excellent dance techniques to music i hold the line at smut but i do enjoy clean yet sexy dance moves my understanding is that this show was inspired by elton john and a few of his colleagues who wanted to put a new spin on ballroom dancing so they gathered together several couples that competed regularly and taught them to dance to a different tune for burn the floor watching all these couples performing together is indeed poetry in motion and sheer perfection i watch my dance movie collection over and over burn the floor is now one of those favorites whew and the last dance number really sizzles
i see lots of complaints here essintially amounting to superb danncing but i can not rip it off for my dance '' i have heard the very same complaints about tapes from all kind of dance competitions i have already seen several copycats of some numbers of the show and i am pretty sure that we shall not see another video of this kind any time soon because i am sure that the dancers are aware of this kind of dancing choreography takes infinitely more sweat blood and brains than what you see in an average las vegas casino and can believe what a pain it be to see it stolen and bastardized i have been watching this show many times sometimes it make me go out and dance myself other times it makes me grieve that i will never dance like this but it never leaves me indifferent and unchanged
i saw this on pbs before i bought it so i new what to expect the costumes are fun where called for and beautiful or imaginitive where they should be the dancing varies from ballroom to modern to interpritive jazz and is performed in spectacular style it is hard to reconcile some of the negative reviews with what i see on this dvd however if you are expecting ballroom dancing as you would see it on pbs or the ballroom competicions on cable channels you will be disapointed if you like spectacular theater you will love it
i 'll admit to you that i love to watch adult swim and i 'll also admit that i like certain types of anime no i 'm not one of those nerdy poke'mon lovers i 'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time i like anime that 's made for adults like big o ! cowboy bebop trigun outlaw star tenchi and ghost in the shell i was watching either watching family guy or aqua teen hunger force when i saw previews for this show start to air on adult swim i thought thought it looked cool it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal but i did n't know the half of it what i got was a version of the old film noir mysteries the series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public in the story 'stand alone complex ' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal or in other words an imaginary criminal it also refers to the structure of each episode each episode can be viewed independently of each other and there is little if at all given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date taking place in a fictional city of japan called '' new port city in the year 2030 stand alone complex tells the story of a special operations called public security section 9 or simply section 9 '' the series follows the exploits of section 9 's agents who range from to as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as the laughing man '' public security section 9 is an elite domestic unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of acts of terrorism and crime their duties include response to serious cyber crimes cyberbrain hacking investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases from they also serve as protection to foreign vips if you have seen the movie then you know that the tv series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole the series of 26 tv episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga in comparison to the film version the series is considered by many to be easier to understand also in comparison the series can be found to be closer to the manga due to the presence of some humor the usage of the tachikomas fuchikomas in the manga and referred to simply as tanks '' in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in the design of the characters and also the usage of the characters paz bouma and saito stand alone complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of production in their application of computer generated imagery this is evident in their digital color grading environmental effects and computer models their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene which adds greatly to the atmosphere i think a lot of people will try to compare this to cowboy bebop as with so many other anime and mangas but that 's foolish stand alone complex is no better or worse than cowboy bebop it 's just a different story different style different sets of charactors and there places if you like anime or manga you 'll definitely like this show it 's complex has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it and not to mention the technology ! even if you do n't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is
the agents of section 9 are desperately tracking down the laughing man '' before he can carry out his plans to kill the police the problem is does the laughing man even exist is it one person or a more conspiracy and what is the truth that they want to be revealed in the third episode on this dvd section 9 investigates a foreign revolutionary who seems to have nine lives and more the last episode hits a more personal note with the major after a friend informs her of suspicious organ traffic which saved a little girl from being forced to have a prosthetic body the girl happens to be around the same age as the major when she became a cyborg i have to say that this second volume of sac is probably one of best anime videos i have ever seen it has it all complex plots finely choreographed fight scenes brillantly edited sequences and great acting ! it has more heart than 99 of the shows you see on television the character interactions are superb and the continuing mystery of the laughing man becomes more and more interesting and let 's not forget the masterful soundtrack by yoko kanno the greatest composer working in the world this disk even includes an interview with her along with the japanese voice actor that plays aramaki also features the tachikoma comedic shorts at the end of each episode presented in anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 english and japanese masterpiece ! !
this is definitely thinking people 's anime gits masterfully incorporates rich animation with a fast paced and deeply interwoven plot line watching the episodes as presented on the dvd helps to pull the storyline together and is well suited for those who wish to become acquainted with the series i really enjoy this particular animation style and the dialogue goes a long way to keep watchers hooked i would recommend this to people who are looking for a show with diverse characters and a topical story line you 'll be through this episodes quickly enough to want to continue the rest of the volumes
as a fan of the orignal gits and of stand alone complex vol 1 i really looked forward to vol 2 and i was not disappointed the story continued where it left off in vol 1 but this time we learn even more about the major her skills and maybe a small scene to some but to me when she blocked a blow and it well do n't want to spoil it but it shows how powerfully build she is while the laughing man from the first vol took up lots of the time the other episodes showed more of her personality including a huge surprise about her love life that was of the us verison of gits comic the art action are crisp and clean the us voice acting is very good not perfect at times but they 've spend money getting some good voice actors as for the sound complain in another review i started off with no sound then realised that i had for dts sound which i do n't have after resetting to stereo the sound came on and it sounded great i recommend ghost in the shell for any anime fan
so far i 've enjoyed this series very much more so than the movie it seems to follow the manga more closely in both style and story i 'm looking forward to the next installment as well i see someone has had a problem with the sound well copy and paste this address http greyghost
i dont really know about teh other two reviews that dissed this series just opinions like anything else really i really enjoyed this anime animation is very good story is fun and action is good could be alittle more but still good the english voices are common around other animes are they picked good ones atleast if you are into ad police witch hunter robin gundam series getbackers and the ghost in the shell movies i think you will enjoy this anime i was really excited that another anime is in anamorphic widescreen making it look great and the speical edition versions have dts but if you go cheaper you can still have 5.1 dolby digital which is good enough for an anime dvd
i purchased this on vhs back in 1994 when it first came out i loved it back then just as much as i do now it is a fast workout that if done daily will give you results the background music and workout clothes are a little cheesy but the movements get the job done even my 14 year old son enjoys working out with me i lost 6 inches off my waist by doing the 8 minute abs portion ! ! if you want a quick but effective workout buy this dvd
bonus stretching aerobic and kickboxing workouts are included i ordered 7 different dvds one day and this one is my favorite
with each workout being only 8 minutes it 's not overwhelming but i feel it through my body so i know that it 's working also you can fit 8 or 16 minutes in your day easily i would highly recommend it
i have four young kids and a travelling husband and we homeschool a gym membership is just not practical right now but i am a person who likes to stay active and somewhat fit this set of dvd 's is totally 80 's but also effective so that 's why i recommend it switch it up a little with some other videos for variety but dedicate just a handful of minutes every day to moving your body and you 'll see results
really great results the get to the point you feel the burn and know that you are doing the exercises properly very happy with the dvds
i usually do n't care much to write a review on products that i buy but i thought that i would on this one because i am so happy with my purchase i have been working out to pilates on and off for the past year and i am more in shape and toned now from working out this dvd for about 4 weeks than ever before in fact i now have abs my friends thought that i shelled out some serious money on a personal trainer when they saw me in a bikini so for those of you who are already in shape somewhat you will definitely see results in about 4 weeks as for arms and legs i supplement the work out to this dvd to also running and working out at the gym so i ca n't give this dvd all the credit for my arms and legs but i can with my abs because i have dropped everthing else i do for abs since i bought this dvd i would definitely recommend purchasing of this dvd
i love it so much that this is the third 8 minute workout dvd that i 've bought for friends ! i recommended that you do the 20 minute kickboxing and the two of the 8 minute workouts i 've been doing that same routine 4 days a week for about 2 months and i 've lost so far i would give this dvd 10 stars if i could !
lord knows with kids its hard to find time for exercise this dvd is a real godsend
a fancy high school with students in their 30 's it was a lot better than i thought it would be lots of good laughs 4 stars because i did n't like the ending
i have this video and i have to say i think it ia good but they should have made it even more better like at least letting kate date him and see if he does cheat on her i give it 4 stars i have watched it 4 times
with little to do in an unfamiliar town i found myself sitting in a familiar place a movie theater my only choice was seeing john tucker must die which i 'll admit i was less than thrilled to see i just hoped that i had n't wasted 8 bucks to eat overpriced popcorn and i was pleasantly surprised john tucker must die is actually funny and cute granted the title gives off an edgy feel something this movie is completely devoid of instead being a chick flicky teen comedy in the same vein as 10 things i hate about you kate brittany snow is the new girl at school her mom jenny mccarthy has a tendency to skip town when things get rough in her love life a la hilary duff 's mom in the perfect man so kate is pretty clueless when it comes to love which is what makes her the perfect vessel for three girls to use in order to get back at john tucker who had been dating all three of them so they set their seemingly evil plan in motion get john tucker to fall for kate and then break his heart but what happens when kate begins thinking that there is more than meets the eye with john tucker that maybe just maybe he actually does like her and she actually likes him do n't get too excited about a possible romance between kate and john because there 's another tucker that kate has her eye on and he has his eye on her instead of teetering between edgy and cute the movie really should 've picked a side and owned it edgy or cute pick one brittany snow is absolutely adorable she has that reese witherspoon quality about her making you like her no matter what she does and jesse metcalfe as john tucker well he 's nice to look at but i wonder why he left desperate housewives to well act in a movie that could be called desperate teenagers oh well good movie cute plot surprisingly ending recommended
i will buy this movie on dvd they said it was supposed to be like mean girls which it did n't quite live up to however i felt good the whole movie laughed a lot and was interested the whole time it is better than talladega nights fun movie go see it
fun to watch entertaining interesting and im glad i have this in my collection
